Binnie are in compliance with and in completion of the 
scheme propounded by the late Sir J Bazalgette forty 
years ago for the main drainage of the metropolis It is 
idle at the present time to wish that the whole scheme of 
disposal of Londons sewage had been such as to return 
refu e to the land and storm water to the river That 
counsel of perfection if it were ever attainable is now out 
of the question except by fundamental reconstruction at 
incalculable cost 
The history of main drainage in London is briefly this 
Up to the year i8i5 it was penal to discharge sewage or 
other offensive matters into the streams or the old natural 
watercourses Cesspools were regarded as the proper 
receptacles for house drainage and the streams as the 
legitimate channels for carrying off the surface waters 
only As population increased the old systenm had to be 
superseded and in the year I847 the first Act was obtained 
making it compulsory to drain houses into the streams 
which discharged directly into the Thames These open 
streams gradually become polluted and covered brick 
channels were necessarily substituted for them The 
drainage of London was thus effected by means of sewers 
running in a general direction at right aDgles to the river 
which as time went on became more and more polluted 
This state of affairs gave rise to such serious complaints 
that after several Commissions had failed to come to 
any practical result in effecting a solution of the difficulty 
the Metropolitan Board of Works was formed with the 
object of preventing the sewage from entering the Thames 
in its passage through London as one of its main duties 
The County Conncil continued the policy of the late 
Board aad constructed many relief sewers at a cost of 
more than a million it also greatly improved the condi 
tion of the Thames at the outfalls by careful chemical 
treatment of the sewage but the time has now arrived 
when the great interception mains five in number which 
cross London from west to east require to be augmented 
The main drainage system was constructed to serve 
3450000 persons with an average water supply of 31j 
gallons per head whereas it now serves 4700000 or 36 
per cent more persons with a water supply of from 35 to 
40 gallons per head The population is increasing at the 
rate of about 4000o0 persons in every ten years The 
system was designed for a dryweather flow of sewage of 
Io8 million gallons daily whereas the quantity now pass 
ing may be taken at about i95 million gallons daily or an 
increase of about 8o per cent The northern lowlevel 
sewer was not designed to take any of the sewage west of 
Chelsea as it was intended to discharge it after treatment 
into the Thames at Fulham The whole of the drainage of 
the area south of the river Thames amounts in dry weather 
to about 8o million gallons daily and all this quantity has 
to pass through the only existing sewer between Deptford 
and Crossness 
THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOUTH 
AFRICA 
THE very interesting letters from our correspondent in 
Capetown which have been published during the last few 
weeks will have been read with interest we believe by all 
and with particular satisfaction by those members of the 
Association who took a share in the long controversy to 
obtain for the medical officers of the army due recognition 
of their true military status Our correspondent who is a 
practitioner of large experience in the Colony has told us 
that the medical arrangements appear to him to be as 
nearly perfect as human foresight can make them and has 
expressed his sense of the great advances made since the 
Zulu war The letters and telegrams of the correspond 
ents of our daily contemporaries bear not less satisfactory 
testimony to the gallantry and devotion shown bv the 
officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps in the field and 
to the foresight displayed by administrative officers 
Thus in Natal Colonel Exham the Principal Medical 
Officer of Sir George Whites force had organised 
hospitals at Ladysmith before hostilities commenced 
and rapidly increased his accommodation for the wounded 
by requisitioning chapels and schools so soon as the first 
shot was fired No doubt in this campaign the task of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps has been very much facilitated 
by two circumstances First of all the railway arrange 
ments have been so good that it has been possiblein 
Natal during the early days of the campaign before the 
investment of Ladysmith and again in the east during 
the advance to Kimberley  to move most of 
the wounded from the field hospitals to the 
hospitals on the lines of communication or at the base 
within a day or two of the action in which they were 
wounded This has left the field hospitals comparatively 
free to deal with fresh casualties while the advantage to 
the wounded of being transported in specially fitted ambu 
lance trains to such wellappointed hospitals as the Royal 
Army Medicsl Corps has been able to fit up in the barracks 
at Wynberg and so saved the hardships necessarily attend 
ing the lot of wounded men carried with an army or treated 
near the front are too obvious to need discussion The 
second point is more unexpected and will undoubtedly 
lead to much discussion in the future It is that in 
spite of quickfiring guns and the reputation of the Boers 
as marksmen with the rifle the number of killed and 
wounded is very distinctly lower than in earlier cam paigns 
Lord Methuen hE s said that the battle of the Modder 
River was one of the hardest fought in the annals of the 
British army Even allowing for a little natural exaggera 
tion on the part of a General who had himself been 
wour ded in the action and discounting very largely the 
picturesque adjectives of some of the correspondents 
there can yet be no doubt that the Boer fire both the rifle 
fire and that from quickfiring guns was very severe yet 
it is surprising to find that the total number of casualties 
was only 475 out of a total force of 65oo This is 7 per 
cent At Inkerman in I854 another soldiers battle 
where the force was only a little larger7474the casual 
ties numbered 2357 or 31 per cent At Waterloo where 
the British force was in round numbers 23000 the 
killed and wounded numbered 6932 or 29 per cent 
while at Albuera in i8I  probably the bloodiest battle 
ever fought by the British army the force of 8200 men 
10st 3990 killed and wounded or 48 percent On the other 
hand the ratio of killed to woiinded in this campaign has 
so far been less than in many previous campaigns though 
nearly identical with the German experience in the Franco 
German war We are unfortunately compelled to hold 
over this week some very interesting remarks on this sub 
ject which we have received from our correspondent a 
South African campaigner but it appears that in the 
RussoTurkish war during which the Russians had fre 
quently to attack entrenched positions the ratio of killed 
to wounded was as high as I to 2 i while Longmore from 
the consideration of a great mass of statistics arrived at a 
general average of i to 4 So far the ratio in Lord 
Methuens force in the three actions at Belmont Graspan 
and Modder in all of which entrenched positions were 
attacked in front the ratio has been approximately I to 53 
Altogether the Royal Army Medical Corps has had to deal 


Dxo 9 t899 CLINICAL RESEARCH IN LONDON  1t623 
with about 8oo wounded from the three actions The 
wounded from Belmont numbered 238 and most were 
sent south by train hefore the later actions took place 
under the direction of SurgeonGeneral Wilson PMO of 
the army corps who met them at Orange River Before 
long we hope to be able to commence the publication of 
letters from a distinguished surgeon who has proceeded to 
South Africa as our special war correspondent and we 
have every reason to anticipate that he will be able to 
report that the arrangements for the reliGf of 
the wounded are continuing to work well At 
any rate we know that no effort is being or will be 
6pared and that the arrangements are under the direction 
of officers of tried ability and long experience as admini 
strators Unfortunately the splendid effort that has 
been made to render the medical arrangements in South 
Africa equal to the greatness of the needs has almost 
denuded home stations Some of the vacant billets have 
been filled by officers from the reserve and others by 
officers who had retired but volunteered for service again 
in this emergency This is not a satisfactory state of 
things and shows convincingly the truth of the conten 
tion which we have again and again advanced in these 
pages that the Army Medical Corps is undermanned No 
doubt we shall leara many lessons from this unhappy war 
Military critics tell us that we shall have to increase the 
artillery and cavalry and we venture to think that though 
no weakness has been disclosed in the field of onerations 
but rather the contrary another lesson will be that 
we must increase the establishment of the Roval Army 
Medical Corps which at the outbreak of hostilities was 
dangerously low even for a peace footing 
CLINICAL RESEARCH IN LONDON 
AT this time when to a superficial observer it might 
appear that the chief end of civilised man is the destruc 
tion of his fellows it is encouraging to those who still 
have faith in human progress to turn to the peaceful 
field of scientific research Reference has already been 
made to the enlightened liberality of the London County 
Council in promoting investigations into the path 
ology of iDsanity now we bave to congratulate the 
Governors of the Middlesex and the Westminster Hospitals 
on the steps which they have recently taken for the further 
ance of clinical research Details of the schemes are given 
elsewhere They appear to be well devised for the special 
end in view and their practical execution bas been placed 
in competent hands so that good results may confidently 
be looked for It is to be hoped that other schools in 
London and elsewhere will follow the example thus set At 
the present time certain millionaires are said to be exercised 
in their minds as to how they may best apply their 
wealth for the good of mankind One of these said 
some time ago that the millionaire who dies rich is dis 
graced As he is credited with the possession of some forty 
millions his position is on his own showiDg a very serious 
one Naturally there is no lack of advisers to suggest 
means by which he may practise the salutary depletion 
which he considers necessary To us there appeal s to be 
no difficulty in the matter The promotion of original re 
search especially in the province of medical science offers 
a practicatlly limitless field for the useful expenditure of 
money and there is certainly no other department of 
human enterprise in which so much absolute good may be 
accomplisbed To any millionaires in doubt wbat to do 
with their money we commend the example of M Osiris a 
wellknown philanthropist who has just given to the ln 
stitute of France a capital sum representing an annual 
income of some 32000 francs for a triennial prize of Iooooo 
francs to be awarded for the most remarkable work or 
discovery from the point of view of the general interest 
M Osiris makes special reference to the fields of surgery 
and medicine In exhibition years the prize is to be open 
to all countries We thik however that the foundation and 
endowment of research laboratories is better than prizes 
as an investment for  the general interest 
THE USE OF PRESERVATIVES IN FOOD 
THE Departmental Committee appointed to inquire into 
the use of preservatives in foods has recently taken the 
evidence of some of the medical officers of health who 
have more particularly interested themselves in the subject 
Theee gentlemen were unanimous in condemning the 
practice of the use of antiseptics in food and agreed that 
it was as unnecessary as it was undesirable Dr Williams 
the Medical Officer of the Glamorgan County Council who 
gave evidence on behalf of the Incorporated Society of the 
Medical Officers of Health gave it as his opinion that the 
practice of drugging the public promiscuously and with 
out their knowledge by incompetent persons was very 
dangerous He found that the amount of boric acid added 
to milk varied from 131 grains to 210 grains per gallon 
while in butter the amount of boric acid was from i to 112 
grains per pound He considered that 17 grains per pound 
was sufficient to preserve butter He was unable to offer 
evidence of any direct injury to health which had resulted 
from the use of preservatives bat like the next witness Dr 
Handford Medical Officer of Health to the Notts County 
Council he believed that injurious effects must follow from 
the use of boric acid in such a large variety of foods 
Dr Alfred Hill the medical officer of health of Birming 
ham had found that 9 per cent of the milk samples sub 
mitted to him for analysis during three years and a half 
contained either boric acid or formaldehyde He gave 
evidence of the injurious effact of milk containing the 
usual quantity of boric acid upon a kitten which died in 
about five weeks He considered that formaldebyde was 
more injurious to health than boric acid for it hardened 
albuminous materials and made them more difficult of 
digestion Of 871 samples of butter examined 243 con 
tained boric acid and of 21 samples of bacon ham 
sausages polonies and pork pies 64 per cent contained 
from IO to 45 grains per pound of boric acid Dr Cameron 
Medical Officer of Health for Leeds gave similar evidence 
and expressed it as his belief that such preservatives inter 
fered with the natural process of digestion he thought 
with others that the use of these preservatives should be 
declared just as chicory in coflee had to be so that the 
purchaser might know what he was buying 
MR D L MOODY ON MEDIC NE 
THERE is not always that sympathy between healers of 
souls and healers of bodies that should exist between 
members of mutually complementary professions The 
mass of the educated clergy of all denominations indeed 
obey the scriptural precept and honour the physician for 
the need they have of him There is however what may 
be called a natural affinity between religious teachers of a 
certain type and quackery We are all the more pleased 
therefore to cite a passage from a sermon recently 
preached in Chicago by Mr D L Moody in which that 
inoted evangelist rebuked a brother preacher who had 
openly supported a notorious American quack and al 
lowed one of his children to die of diphtheria without 
calling in a medical practitioner Mr Moody after 
pointing out that the saviDg of souls and the healing 
of the body are two entirely different functions 
went on to say  I do not believe that doctors are 
devils The noblest profession outside of the ministry 
is that of medicine Never yet in all my years 
of work have I called upon an able doctor telling 
him of the gickness and need of some poor friend 
less person that he did not at once go to the 
rescue without money and without price Some of 
the noblest men I ever knew have gone out as medical 
missionaries devoting their lives to doing good with the
