peared to be in great pain but passed no blood in his stools 
after admission 
The treatment adopted in each case was the hypodermic 
injection of half a grain of morphine the administration of 
brandy 3 is with the application of a mustard plaster to the 
cardiac area hot poultice to the abdomen and hot bottles to the 
extremities On regaining consciousness they complained of 
intense pain in the epigastric region and all over the abdomen 
Laudanum ntxx and gruel were given as soon as they could 
swallow and the injection of morphine was repeated next 
morning Both men made a good recovery and were dis 
charged from hospital on February 16th 1900 On refer

The Wounded in the Present War 
Mr Trves lately Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force 
Natal gave an address on this subject After expressing his 
sense of the honour done him in asking him to give such an 
address he said  
Modern Rifles 
I may in the first place drawattention to the weapons that are 
being used in this particular campaign especially the Mauser 
and the LeeMet ford rifles It is a somewhat extraordinary 
thing that the development of the rifle as an instrument for 
carrying the missile long distances with a flat trajectory does 
not quite coincide with its destructive powers because 
although the rifle may be said to be an enormous improve 
ment upon the MartiniHenry still I suppose that in war the 
purpose of the rifle is to destroy or disable as many men as 
possible and as completely as possible And if that really be 
considered to be the test of a good rifle then the rifles used in 
the present campaign cannot be considered as good perhaps as the oldfashioned weapon I might perhaps be allowed to 
mention one or two facts about this weapon 
The Rifling 
The purpose of rifling is to give rotation to the ball in its 
long axis Unless that be done the ball as a projectile if it 
4e a conical ball is practically futile A cylindrical bullet of 
which I show you an example Fig 6 coming from a smooth 
bore rifle would begin to rotate on its short axis immediately 
it left the muzzle and even at the distance of a few yards 
would strike a target on the flat  therefore as a projectile it 
would be useless A Martini rifle has one complete turn of 
the barrel in 22 inches the LeeMetford actually doubles 
that and makes one complete turn in 10 inches The Mauser 
makes one complete turn in 8 inches so that as far as velocity 
in the rotation of the bullet at the muzzle is concerned the 
Mauser is by far the superior weapon 
The great object in all four rifles is to get a flat trajectory 
that means much greater accuracy in shooting in regard to 
the sighting of the rifle Much harder hitting is secured 
because it is a cleaner hit and of course a very greatly 
increased danger zone especially with regard to cavalry 
The bullet of a Snider sighted to 2 000 yards will have to rise 
310 less than 866 feet above the line of shot the Martini 
Henry sighted for 2000 yards will have to rise 357 feet which 
means an enormous zone where a man might walk about at 
his ease without the least possibility of being hit between 
the rifle and the target The LeeMetford has the same 
range but only rises the short distance of 1Q4 feet and conse 
quently the trajectory is very nearly flat The muzzle 
velocity of the MartiniHenry was only 1350 feet per second  
the muzzle velocity of the LeeMetford is 2000 feet per 
second and the muzzle velocity of the Mauser 2300 feet per 
second 
Ihe Bullet 
With regard to the shape of the bullet this bullet of a 
LeeMet ford Fig 3 is supposed to represent the acme of 
perfection in the shape of a bullet In a very admirable 
book published by the War Office authorities as a Textbook 
for Military Small Arms it is stated that the power of a 
bullet to overcome resistance must be directly proportional 
to its weight and inversely proportional to its cross 
section It comes to pass therefore that an elongated 
trajee tile such as the Mauser or the LeeMet ford bullet has 
an enormous advantage owing to its small diameter This is 
the reason that there has been a progressive reduction in the 
bore until it has been reduced to its present small section 
Of two bullets of equal weight and of equal diameter the 
longer bullet has a better range With regard to the head of 
the bullet the particular type which offers the very least re 
sistance is that known as ogival which means that the curve 
is made up of a part of the circle the radius of which is equal 
to two diameters of the base of the bullet This is shown 
perfectly well in a Mauser or in a Lee Metford bullet 
The LeeMetford bullet is a more destructive bullet than 
the Mauser This opinion is based upon the cases of a num 
ber of wounded Boers we had at Spearmans Camp after the 
battle of Vaal Krautz and also upon the reports especially 
the report of Dr Mackenzie in the Lancet of February 17th 
who gives an account of a certain number of wounded Boers 
These specimens I have brought back are all without excep 
tion from the Boer trenches and they have been beauti 
fully mounted by Mr Shattock of the College of Surgeons 
I should say that all these bullets including the LeeMetford 
and the Mauserand this is a matter of the utmost import 
ance with regard to bone injuriesare made up of a core com 
posed of lead hardened with 2 per cent of antimony and of a 
shell or thimble made up of 80 per cent copper and 20 per 
cent nickel So far as I know the thimble or shell of the 
Mauser and LeeMetford are exactly the same The Lee 
Metford and the Mauser bullets both placed on a level base 
are shown of natural size Figs 3 and 5 The LeeMetford is 
the larger missile of the two but as a matter of fact the 
difference in size is comparatively slight For instance the 
LeeMetford measures 125 inch the Mauser 119 The 
diameter of the LeeMetford bullet is 0311 inch the diameter 
of the Mauser is 0284 inch The weight of the LeeMetford 
bullet is 215 grs the weight of the Mauser is 173 grs I may 
mention that the weight of the MartiniHenry bulletthe 
most destructive bullet seen in this campaignis 480 grs the 
length 127 in and the diameter 045 The Mauser bullet has 
a groove in the bottom of the cartridge to fix into the clips 
for Mauser cartridges are carried in clips of five which is 
the size of the magazine In the section of the Mauser 
bullet Fig 6 and cartridge case the smokeless powder 
which is black and like minute pieces of coal is seen packed 
up at the bottom of the cartridge  the core is of hardened 
lead and the thimble composed of copper and nickel In the 
section of bullet and cartridge case the cordite is seen in the 
LeeMetford Fig 4 arranged in strings like gelatine The 
extraordinary thing is that Thomas Atkins extracts this 
cordite which is made from nitroglycerine from the 
cartridge and eats it It is a mild form of stimulant 
I pass now to what I think is a very important matter This 
slide Figs 8 and 9 shows the thimbles of a LeeMetford and 
a Mauser bullet A gunsmith has dissolved the lead out and 
left the shell intact An untouched Mauser is also shown 
The weight of the thimble varies very considerably that of 
the LeeMetford weighs 33 gr of the Mauser 22 gr They are 
quite different at the apex The Mauser seems to have been 
strengthened at the apex The LeeMetford is about the 
same thickness throughout and the breaking of the cap or 
tue apex of the bullets is a matter of very considerable im 
portance 
The Fine Hitting of the Mauser 
There is I suppose no smallbore bullet that can effect the 
same perforations as this bullet can I have here a specimen 
one of the strangest I have seen It is a LeeMetford cartridge 
which was carried in the cartridge case of a man who was in 
theas8ault on Spion Kop The Mauser bullet has passed 
through the centre of the cartridge and the point of entry and 
the point of exit can be seen It has hardly bent the cart 
ridge and the cordite is perfectly intact in the interior The

bullet went through the abdomen and came out through the 
buttock and as not uncommonly happens produced practically 
no symptoms One could hardly have believed that a bullet 
at long range as must have been the case here could have 
struck a smooth round cylinder of brass like the LeeMetford 
cartridge and have gone straight through without exploding 
the cordite and gone through the man without producing any 
ill effect The ordinary clip of Mausers which the Boers 
ise contains five cartridges They are carried in a 
bandolier which has a series of little pockets each 
with five holes to take the five cartridges belonging 
to each clip The only piece of sentiment connected with the 
particular bandolier I show is that it was taken from a dead 
Boer in a trench at Pieters on the roid to Ladysmith and he

badonly one single clip of cartridges left I have left it as it was 
taken off the body He was like many of the Boers in that 
last engagement reduced to his very last round There were 
several cases ontheMooi River of a nerve being penetrated by 
Mauser bullet One bullet which I have made a button 
hole opening and went through a nerve without dividing it 
We had several cases of bones perforated by the Mauser 
bullet as though a gimlet had been passed through The 
most picturesque case of that was a man who was shot in the 
armoured train fight between Frere and Chieveley A Mauser 
bullet went through the middle phalanx of the ring finger and through the middle phalanx of the little finger making 
four perfect holes and he made an absolutely perfect re 
covery When I last saw that man you could1 not tell that 
the hand had been wounded I do not say his bones had 
been perforated because they were less in diameter than the 
section of the Mauser bullet but the fracture was so clean 
fiat he recovered with a useful hand As far as I have been 
able to see I believe the Mauser bullet is never diverted in 
the body 
Effects at Different Ranges 
There is another very important matter which this war will 
settle The textbooks on gunshot injuries all repeat this one 
formula that is that the mechanical power of a bullet the 
m asure of the work it can do is represented by the formula 
MVa M being the mass and V the velocity If that be true 
of course the range is everything If a man is shot at 150 
yards his limb would be smashed  if at 1500 yards the wound 
would be trifling That is said to be based on experiments 
jn which corpses and dead animals had been shot at at various 
ranges I feel as certain as I can be of anything that that 
formula is wrong and I believe that when the details and 
data of this war are published that formula will be modified 
Of course it is very difficult to get a proper account of 
the range for every man says he was shot at a range of 150 
or 200 yards With smokeless powder it is very difficult to 
get the range in most cases and in some there had been a cross 
fire and it was difficult to know from which side the man was 
shot From noting myself men who were struck down in an 
engagement which I was watching I was quite certain being

MEDIOAL AND CHIRURGICAL 
SOCIETYMay 12 190a 
able to form an idea of the range that range was not every 
thing Mr Dent whose very admirable letters in the 
British Medical Journal we have all read with such in 
struction says that the range matters very little Perhaps 
that is a little too strong but I am quite confident that the 
range does not mean what that formula MV2 means 
The11 Explosive 
 
Effect 
The next point is as to the explosive effect of these bullets 
This unfortunate term has crept into the reports Of course 
there is no such thing as an explosive bullet it is a pre 
posterous term The term 
 
expansile bullet may be perhaps 
justifiable and the explosive effect depends upon this 
that when a man is struck with a bullet it makes 
a small point of entrance and the rest of the wound is like an 
inverted funnel I have seen the point of entrance as big as 
what a soldier calls a bugbite and the point of exit the size of 
a fiveshilling piece1 or bigger the wound being practically 
funnelshaped It is not a question of the shock of the impact 
the wound is blown out the bone is broken and the fragments 
are driven up and down the limb so that there is a gap 
between the two ends This effect is uniform precise and 
easily recognised and is what is meant when the explosive 
effect of a bullet is spoken of There is a very positive cavity 
and the bone is separated by a real gap All the textbooks 
state that that is solely the effect of the velocity of the bullet 
or in other words the range of it  but I am confident that 
that is not accurate in regard to this smallbore bullet I 
notice from the textbooks that experiments on animals do not 
always quite agree Some say that the explosive effect is shown 
up to 500 yards and others up to 750 yards All I can say is 
that all the cases in which I have seen explosive effects have 
been at comparatively short range and I am certain it is not 
range and range only I have seen a perfectly clean perfora 
tion of a bone at a short range as for instance at Vaal Krantz 
where the firing was from one Boer ridge It is true tbat in 
every case in which explosive effects have been manifest it 
has been at a short range and in every instance in which the 
bullet has been retained it has been found to be deformed 
The Softrosed Bullet 
The bullet which I show Fig 2 I picked up in the Boer 
trenches after the Boers had evacuated Hlanganwe Hill The 
nickel casing of the bullet has been cut away at the top 
exposing the lead core which is not hardened with antimony 
The result is that the lead mushrooms out It has been said 
that the Boers use this that and the other bullet but I was 
through the whole of the Natal campaign and we never had 
any evidence of the socalled explosive bullet until the last 
thirteen days before the entrance into Ladysmith Then 
about 10 per cent of the wounds were due to softnosed 
bullets I must bear witness that the statements about the 
use of these bullets are not well founded 
 
Poisoned Bullets Socalled 
A point uppermost in the public mind at this moment has 
reference to poisoned bullets and I have here an ordinary clip 
of Mauser bullets which I picked up at Colenso The bullet 
is coated with some bright green greasy material and it is 
evident the bullets have been dipped into something for the 
tallowlike material is seen adherent to the metal It is posi 
tively stated that this is poison I saw in the Daily News of 
as recent a date as three or four days ago the statement that 
these bullets had been dipped in verdigris I understand 
that verdigris is a basic acetate of copper and tbat it is 
poisonous Some of these clips all of which I picked up in 
the Boer trenches have been examined by Mr Hugh Candy 
the Lecturer on Chemistry at the London Hospital who re 
ports as the result of his chemical analysis that the green 
material is absolutely nonpoisonous The basis of the com 
pound is paraffin and the colour is due to an oxide of nickel  
and as there is 20 per cent of nickel in the coating of this 
bullet it is reasonable to suppose that it is produced from 
the thimble and not from anything added Anyhow Mr 
Candy assures me that it has been examined for every 
reasonable poison but that the results have been negative  
therefore this substance must have been used for the purpose 
of keeping the barrel free of fouling 
1 38 cmm 
Shell Wounds 
With regard to shell wounds I will say nothing except 
that we met with both common shell and shrapnel Nothing 
is more magnificent than the bursting of English shrapnel  
and the sight of the last assault at Ladysmith when there 
were ninetyfour guns playing upon Pieters Hill was a sight 
which could not be equalled on this earth It was towards 
the end of the evening the sun was lighting up the edge of 
the ridge and at the back was a thunder cloud rising over 
Umbulwana The shrapnel looking ike puffs of white snow 
afforded a very marvellous spectacle 
Common shell for the 47 gun is an explosive cylindrical  
hollow cell containing a bursting charge The effect of the 
explosion is seen from the dust it raises and the bits of stone 
it knocks up I picked up pieces of shell which were hurled 
out by the shell bursting some of tke pieces of which might 
be driven right through a mans head One particular 
specimen I have shown is apiece of a shell from Long 
Tom which was fired into a street at Ladysmith I brought 
it from there and it was given me by the man who picked it 
up At the bottom of the specimen can be seen what is called 
the driving band and a notion can be formed of the gigantic 
weight of the shell fired by that enormous gun and how it 
breaks up into fragments 
Shrapnel I need not say is a conical shell containing from 150 
to 200 bullets Fig 7 according to whether it is fired from a 12 
or 1 pounder Shrapnel contains a bursting charge set off by a 
time fuse the endof the shrapnel is blown out and the bullets 
acquire the velocity of the missile All shrapnel breaks in the 
air and from a howitzer it breaks high up in the air and de 
scends The velocity of the descending shrapnel is the 
velocity of the missile itself and the bullet is not shot out of it 
by gunpowder The iron of the shell itself is twisted 
by the bursting charge The Boer shrapnel of which I have a 
specimen picked up in Ladysmith and not exploded is similar 
in shape to our shrapnel 
A waterbottle belonging to an English soldier at the battle 
field of Spion Kop shows the point of entrance or a shrapnel 
bullet which went through the waterbottle and then through 
the man the man recovered without any grave symptoms 
The bottle shows that the hole was a very clean one just 
taking the shrapnel bullet and not very much more The size of 
the shell of the Maxim gun is shown in Fig 1 
Lyddite 
The Boer prisoners were not pleased with lyddite but it has 
nothing like the effect that is ascribed to it A lyddite shell 
bursting in soft ground as it did in a farm near Spearmans 
Camp makes certainly a big hole but if it falls on to well 
made ground such as railway road it does not make the enor 
mous cavern that has been described The fumes are always 
dense yellow Several Boers were brought in suffering from 
concussion produced by lyddite They remained insensible for 
oneor two days but without any sign of injury of any sort due to 
lyddite The smell of lyddite is very distressing and the 
best testimony as to this is from our own men Some of the 
Kings Royal Rifles in mounting a kopje to take a trench had 
one of our shells fall within a distance of 50 yards from them 
The officer in charge of the line told me that they could 
scarcely breatne  they had to keep their faces almost on the 
ground to avoid the awful stench of this explosive But I 
think the statement of the terrific effect of lyddite shells is 
exaggerated If one came into a room like the one we are in 
now it would not blow the whole place right out and to say 
that its fumes are absolutely poisonous is untrue 
Expansile Effect 
I show a specimen Fig 13 demonstrating the expansile 
effect of a Mauser bullet In this case the man was struck on 
the outer side of the deltoid muscle  the wound was a clean 
hole which would not have taken more than the point of a 
pencil It had produced an ordinary oblique fracture of the 
bone as was inevitable and it had blown away the head 
of the humrus On examination hardly any fragments 
of bone were found at all  they had been practically 
pulverised The bullet made a kind of trap door into 
the scapula and was found close to the vertebra The 
I bullet has been fixed on the scapula and is shown

on the photograph It presents the ordinary deformity  
that is to say the flattening out of the core and a breaking up 
of the thimble The case is an interesting one to me because  
I amputated the entire upper extremity collar bone shoulder  
blade and upper limb and it is the first case so treated in i 
the field The man is now I am 
glad to say in England and quite 
well 
The next specimens illustrate 
how the Mauser bullet is de 
formed by striking bone Here 
is a bullet that is almost in 
pieces Fig n The top can be 
lifted off like a cap and you can 
scarcely believe that this bul 
let fractured a mans femur It 
did not however pass out of the 
limb and I cut it out after the 
battle of Colen80 
Shrapnel bullets Fig 7 are 
not quite round the spheres 
being seldom perfect but these 
bullets may pass through liver 
and kidneys practically without 
producing symptoms 
Hospitals Transport and 
Ambulances 
Mr Trves next showed on the 
screen lantern slides of the pho 
tographs reproduced in the 
British Medical Journal of 
April 14th pp 914 and 915 and 
then made the following ob 
servation on the ambulances  
The ambulance carts are cer 
tainly not adapted to the coun 
try in which they are now work 
ins Thev are macnificentlv 
made waggons will stand anything and are drawn by 
ten mules and driven by Kaffir boys  they are very service 
able but they are very hard to ride in The Boer ambulance 
cart on the other hand is a modified spider cart and is ad 
mirably suited to its work 
I think you will permit me to show you the next slide 
because I really wish 
to do everything I 
can to acknowledge 
the extraordinary 
kindness and gene 
rosity of the autho 
rities of the Army 
Medical Department 
They very kindly put 
at my disposal this 
cart Fig 14 with 
sixteen mules a 
Scotch cart a con 
ductor four Kaffir 
boys a horse and 
a man The cart 
shown in the figure 
entered Ladysmith 
but it broke down 
coming from Lady 
smith and was left 
in a spruit Ac 
cording to some of 
the enterprising war 
correspondents this 
was the cart that 
Joubert lived in and 
as such it has been 
accurately described 
Mr Trves then showed photographs of the hospital trains 
which he said were managed by the indefatigable Major 
BrazierCreagh and were of enormous service in Natal 
Commenting on that reproduced in the Journal of April 14th 
p 914 he said 
Pig 13 
t   
We had to fill up the train from the level of the line and 
it was very distressing to get the patients on board because 
they had to be taken from the army stretchers then put into 
the carriage stretchers and then put into the train 
Wounds of Soft Parts 
The skin wounds are exceed 
ingly simple and very small 
Th wound of entrance is cir 
cular and Mr Tommy At 
kins always describes it as a 
bugbite The wound of exit 
is in many cases but little lar 
ger possibly it may be a lit 
tle larger but in many cases 
the entrance and the exit 
wounds are of exactly the same 
size Wounds are very easily 
overlooked and primary heal 
ing is almost invariable 
The field dressing attached 
to every soldiers coat is quite 
admirable and one of the very 
best things that has been in 
troduced as a primary dress 
ing The only criticism is that 
it contains a piece of mackin 
tosh which it is directed should 
be put over the wound In 
bot weather it is better for 
that to be omitted but of course 
if it is raining it should be 
used 
In no case have I found any 
clothing carried into the wound 
Once I found a piece of a rifle 
carried in In this case the 
officer was on a stretcher when 
he was struck in the knee and 
in the hand the leaden core of the bullet was left in the knee 
where it can now quire easily be seen with the rays The 
thimble went into the hand and I removed it yesterday I 
may say this that in spite of statements to the contrary I 
am certain that 20 per cent of Mauser bullets are retained 
They do not go right through the body 
I have picked out 
three statements 
from the current 
textbooks which I 
merely mention be 
cause I think they 
are not borne out 
by what has been 
observed during 
the present war It 
is stated that the 
entrance and the 
exit holes decrease 
in size as the 
range increases but 
that is not my 
experience Again 
it is said that a 
circular and small 
wound of exit is 
rare when a bone 
is hit but that 
is not my expe 
rience I have seen 
the very smallest 
hole after the bul 
let has actually 
passed through a 
bone It is said 
that the largest exit wounds are those at short ranges but 
that again is not my experience 
Shock is always slight in these cases and it is 
often slight after abdominal wounds Some men scarcely 
kaow that they are hurt and the common remark is 


6o MlwSj ROYAL MEDICAL AND CHIRURGICAL SOCIETY May 12 1900 
 
that the blow felt as if the man had been struck with a 
hammer 
H morrhage 
External haemorrhage of any kind is rare Colonel Steven 
son in by far the best book on gunshot wounds that has 
appeared writes that haemorrhage from direct hits from the 
new bullet will certainly be more profuse than was the case 
in similar injuries with the old spherical bullet but that has 
not been borne out for the haemorrhage is less Men coming 
down with tourniquets are exceedingly few The ingenuity 
with which a sailor invents a tourniquet is marvellous the 
most perfect I saw was in a case of a wound of the ulnar 
artery where the tourniquet on the brachial was composed of 
a plug of tobacco and the tape of a puttey Internal bleeding 
is not uncommon especially in abdominal cases and it may 
be very copious Extensive subcutaneous haemorrhages are 
seen with injuries received at a short range 
I will not trouble you with any bullet stories for the bullet 
story is becoming very much worse than the fish story 
Bullets have gone through brain lung heart almost and 
every other part of the body without causing the man anything 
more than a little interest in his case I will mention one 
case however which I have already published3 and it still 
remains unintelligible to me The man was crawling up 
towards a ridge when he was struck by a bullet which entered 
above the collarbone in the neck and the bullet came out on 
the inner side of the opposite thigh without producing literally 
any inconvenience or any symptoms of any sort whatsoever 
except that the man being wounded thought he had better 
take advantage of it and get the bread and other luxuries that 
we might have for the wounded 
Injuries of Bones 
I hope you will permit me to take four of the most pro 
minent statements made in the most recent textbooks which 
I have picked out because I do not believe that they are accu 
rate  at all events they are not borne out by experience in the 
present war The first is that the severity of the injury to 
bone decreases as the range increases the second is that 
explosive effects are produced when a bone is hit at short 
range such as 500yards or under  the third is that fractures 
are nearly always oblique  and the fourth is that when abone 
is fractured the exit wound is always larger than when this 
does not occur 
The first of these statements is not in accord with my 
experience  and Mr Dent I am glad to find says also that he 
is not convinced of the influence of range 
With regard to the alleged obliquity of fractures I should 
say deliberately that the great majority of fractures in this 
war due to Mauser bullets have been transverse Certainly 
they are adjusted with the greatest possible ease The state 
ment that the exit wound is always larger when bone has been 
struck is not correct It has not been possible to establish 
any such rule  I have seen many cases in which the bone has 
been fractured in which the wounds of exit and entry were 
exactly alike 
Transverse fractures of the lower end of the femur going 
into the joint are uncommon whereas injuries to the head 
of the humrus and the lower end of the tibia are more 
common 
The injuries involving bone are as aseptic as the wounds of 
the soft parts with the exception that the very worst element 
in the treatment of these bone fractures is the long transport 
which is almost fatal for a gunshot wound of the thigh But 
if such a case were allowed to lie In the field hospital for 5 days 
it was not necessary to look at him any more If however 
such a case was put into a train and taken for 2 days on the 
railway down to the base hospital that case would probably end 
fatally Long transport was really impossible in gunshot 
wounds of big bones like the femur In our field hospital we 
could keep such patients quiet and they did exceedingly well 
and we never had any sort of anxiety with cases of fracture of 
the femur We always kept them until we had the usual 
notice to quit 
I think I am sure that the DirectorGeneral will agree with 
me in saying that that is an advantage of having a big field 
hospital following the main column because these cases can 
kept for four days or so and then allowed to po down Hard 
transport or mule train or the big mule ambulance was really 
impossible 
Trephining 
I can say nothing whatever about the telephone probe 
because of the want of time nor about head injuries except 
to say that no operations in the field did anything like so 
well as these There is no doubt that in head injuries the 
rule should be not to operate in this case or to operate in that 
or to operate under these conditions or under those conditions 
but to operate in every single instance of gunshot wound of 
the head I have been asked what were the usual fatal cases 
A man taking shelter behinda boulder lifts up his head and 
gets a bullet through it and though in going over the dead I 
could not give the exact proportionI could not even guess 
at ityet I think because probably the head injuries are more 
easily seen one came to arrive at the impression that the 
majority of those killed on the spot were shot through the 
head 
Abdominal Injuries 
I will say nothing about spinal injuries but if you will 
allow me I will say a few words about abdominal injuries 
Everyone who went out to this war thought that this was the 
time for abdominal surgery because abdominal surgery had 
been introduced since the last big war The results how 
ever have been very disappointing Two factors must be 
considered First of all the proportion of recoveries without 
operation is very high  and secondly operative treatment of 
gunshot wounds of the abdomen in the field is exceedingly 
disappointing I had this advantage that being quite close 
up to the front all the time we could have our patients 
brought into the hospital directly and so there was no ques 
tion of loss of time Nevertheless the results were exceed 
ingly disappointing 
The mortality from abdominal wounds in the American 
Civil War was over 90 per cent My impression is that in this 
war taking men shot through the belly 60 per cent have re 
covered without operation How that opinion may be modi 
fied when the actual facts are published I do not know but 
as I say I have come to the conclusion that a Mauser bullet 
through the abdomen only involved a 60 per cent risk of death 
I will first of all ask Why do these cases get well without 
operation  How is it that 60 per cent get well without any 
treatment  If the individual is wounded when fastingand 
in these long engagements such as Colenso the men were 
always fasting and often had been for hoursthat circum 
stances contributes to recovery Another fact favouring re 
covery the importance of which cannot be exaggerated is 
easy and short transport The men that came down from 
Spion Kop were from a surgical point of view hopeless 
Spion Kop is very difficult to get up and almost worse to get 
down  a long distance had to be done over rocks and the 
men had to be brought by handcarriage down the mule path 
and then carried by mule ambulance into the hospital We 
lost 33 men in seven days after the battle of Spion Kop hav 
ing had 750 wounded on that particular night 
The marvellous things that happened are shown by the 
cases I have published all in patients who were shot through 
the belly Beyond that fact nothing occurred They were 
shot through the abdomen and it was interesting to them to 
know that but there was nothing else to notice One of the 
cases was that of a bullet wound close to the umbilicus  the 
bullet came out by the epine of the second lumbar vertebra 
What had happened to the structures like the big blood vessels 
I do not know One bullet went in in the anterior part of one 
loin and came out at the other loin after having traversed 
the whole belly Onewent in exactly over the stomach and 
came out over the right loin  another went in at the tip of 
the eleventh rib and came out at the axilla In none of 
those cases had the men any more than what would be 
called trifling symptoms such as those they would get 
from eating a green spple We unfortunately learned 
by carrying out operations which ought not to have been done 
that the hole made by the Mauser bullet in the bowel is very 
minute It is oiten quite well closed by two Lembert sutures 
and I am certain that the hole is closed almost directly by 
the apposition of adjacent coils of intestine I may be wrong 
but my impression is that when a man is struck in the abdo 
men peristalsis stops I think it physiologically probable 2 British Medical Journal January 27th p 221

that the shock of a wound through the belly would stop peri 
stalsis I never found a case in which it was necessary to 
dilate the bowel with hydrogen or anything of that sort I 
found in one or two abdominal sections I made that I did 
nothing but harm because in searching for the damage I 
opened wounds which were already closed That of course 
one had to learn by experience I began to search about 
when out came some gas and I said 
 
Here I have opened a 
part which was already sealed I think I learned that the 
cases that do worst are those associated not with a particular 
wound here or a wound there but those associated with 
copious internal haemorrhage and I think that impression is 
likely to be correct 
The next point is why these operations are so exceedingly 
disappointing There are five points I would draw your atten 
tion to  First there is the enormous pressure on time when 
men are coming in by ambulance after ambulance not in 
tens and twenties but in hundreds and there are only ten 
medical men Under such circumstances you cannot really 
eay 
 
We will do an abdominal section in this case The 
afternoon would be taken up by it and there are fifty things 
which must be donemen who are bleeding and matters of 
great urgency to be attended to Therefore it would be in 
human to say 
u We will let all this crowd go let us do this 
abdominal section No department could have been more roy 
ally liberal than the Army Medical Department was in this cam 
paign  but of course you cannot flood the place with medical 
men  you cannot say let us have fifty or sixty But after a big 
engagement like that of Colenso when we hid 800 wounded 
and after Spion Kop there was great pressure Then there is 
great delay in getting the patients in from the field At 
Spion Kop the wounded had to lie on the hill many hours 
before the Boers buried their own dead and would allow us 
to touch our wounded Then there was the difficulty of 
getting them down Long transport was another reason for 
patients doing badly Think of the difficulties of operating 
on an abdominal case I show you a slide of the operating 
table we had made of biscuit boxes3 There was no water  
at least there was1 water but it was not anything that we are 
accustomed to call water It will be said Why not boil it  
But where is the fuel There is nothing on the veld but 
grass  we are twentysix miles from the railway Some may 
say Why not use methylated spirits  Can you carry that 
about in any quantity  Others may say Filter the water 
Well I never could get anything like half a bottle of 
water filtered without having to take the filter to pieces 
and clean it because it was found to be thickly coated 
with mud There was no doubt that Jameson was right when 
he said that the proper way to treat South African water is 
first to boil it then pass it through a filter and then throw it 
away You cannot realise starting an abdominal section 
without towels You may say Have plenty of towels but if 
we started with 600 towels where are the laundries  There 
is the veld and there is the Tugela but the Tugela is covered 
by Boer rifles What is to be done  You say well take 1000 
towels Well take 1000that means 16 more oxenand 
even then your towels are no good It cannot be done  in 
the country you cannot manufacture water and you can 
not produce in the middle of a deserted place a complete 
laundry 
Another thing which rendered abdominal surgery almost 
impossible was the trouble we had from flies It is easy to 
imagine it but I do not think anybody can describe it Ones 
hands were covered with flies as one operated put them 
away as we might they were there again If a piece of bowel 
came out it was covered with flies  we kept wisps going and 
we tried all sorts of things but you cannot keep the South 
African fly away 
Lastlyand I do not wish to say too much about this 
of course the hospital orderly admirable a man as he may 
be is not really quite the man to nurse from first to last an 
abdominal case I should like to be very gentle with the 
hospital orderly  but he has to go and unship a waggon pitch 
a lot of tents and dig a trench for the kitchen At one time 
he is handling a spade at another time a bucket at another 
time heavy boxes and he is not exactly aseptic to look at 
There are not unlimited shirts up there It cannot be helped  
if you had millions with you you could not do much better 
There remains the fact that the hospital orderly is not quite 
I the person you would entrust with an abdominal case I 
might mention this  that I was able to do all my abdominal 
cases by taking with me sealed tins containing dressings and 
needles They do not take up much room they are all 
prepared in England and I took enough to last me all 
through The tin is opened by taking hold of a strip 
and tearing across as a meat tin is opened The box makes 
a tray for sponges The box contains enough carbolic to 
make a i in 20 solution and all the ligatures and catgut in 
fact all the material necessary for abdominal section 
The lid makes an instrument tray and will take 
all the scalpels or scissors wanted I suppose it 
is true as Lord Lister said that an instrument kept 
for 15 minutes in a 1 in 20 solution of carbolic 
acid is clean The sponges are all damp ready for use I 
brought two or three tins back and they were examined in 
the bacteriological laboratory at the London Hospital by Dr 
Bulloch who says they are absolutely sterile I did not want 
any water as the sponges were wet  I wanted nothing Of 
course one would like to wash ones hands but there are 
clean instruments clean sponges and so on 
Conclusions 
I have put down the circumstances that I think I learnt 
would argue for abdominal section and the circumstances 
against it The circumstances in favour of operation I would 
I enumerate under we heads  
1 If the patient is seen before seven hours which is not an 
unreasonable limit 
2 If the patient has had a short and easy transport We 
had many of those 
3 An empty stomach I should say that in some few antero 
posterior wounds of the abdomen above the umbilicus it is a 
sine qu non that it should be a case with an escaped bullet 
especially when associated with extensive haemorrhage Then 
I deliberately believe that a patient ought to be operated upon 
It might be thought that such cases would be very com 
mon  but in fact they are very uncommon 
The circumstances against operation are  
1 If the patient is not seen till more than seven hours after 
the wound I do not say that this is an absolute bar but it is 
one argument against operation 
2 If there has been a long and arduous transport 
3 If he has been wounded soon after a meal That is very 
improbable 
41 should exclude all cases of transverse or oblique wounds 
above the umbilicus because it is practically impossible 
to do all that is required I will not trouble you with the 
details now but I did some operations in such cases I found 
six eight ten twelve openings in the bowel and when I had 
seen to these I had six holes in the mesentery and very 
likely wounds in the liver I am speaking of transverse or 
oblique wounds 
5 I exclude all cases of retained bullet We can see the 
point of entrance but where is the bullet  It may have 
gone this way or it may have gone that way  we do not know 
anything about it You cannot in the field embark on any 
of those operations where you can bring out the viscera in 
the same way as you might post mortem It may be very 
well in a hospital but it cannot be done in the field I 
would not touch such a case 
6 I would exclude all cases of wound of the liver of the 
spleen and of the kidney We had such cases in large 
numbers A certain famous officer whose name I will not 
mention had a shrapnel bullet go through the liver and 
through the right kidney He has come home here and is now 
quite well 
7 Do not operate on most cases below the umbilicus 
because they do all right if they are left alone 
8 Lastly I would not operate upon a case in which I 
thought the colon was implicated alone I might except the 
transverse colon because the cases did very well if they were 
left alone But with an anteroposterior wound with an 
escaped bullet which is a sine qua wonthat is to say if 
where it went in and where it came out can be seen I believe 
I have learnt that the bowels do not move after they have 
been struck 8 TVRTTT5H VKDICAi JOURNAL Anril nth T ni T

It comes to this that the cases that are suited for abdominal 
section in the field are roughly exceedingly few 
Stationary Hospitals 
The DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical Depart 
ment felt that he had some of the credit of the good results of 
which he had heard that night in that he had had the honour of 
recommending Mr Trves for the appointment A stationary 
hospital behind the field hospital was not always possible  its 
possibility depended greatly on whether or not we were getting 
the best of the battle The length of transport certainly 
overned 
in great measure the septicity of wounds and 
oubtless the wounded should be kept in stationary hospitals 
for days whenever possible The observations on the plague 
of women which Mr Trves had made at home had borne 
fruit in South Africa as manifested by the fact that the Royal 
Engineers had already encircled the hospitals containing 
enteric cases with a barbedwire fence 
SurgeonGeneral Muir thanked Mr Trves for his very 
instructive and able paper

Cross Infection socalled in Fever Hospitals 
Dr Claude B Ker medical superintendent of the Edin 
burgh City Hospital read a paper on this subject In the 
Edinburgh City Hospital a certain number of cases were an 
nually attacked by some infection other than that for which 
they were admitted Such accidents could hardly fail to 
happen in any building with a large population of children 
The causes alleged by critics were 1 the carrying of infection 
by the staff from one ward to another 2 infection by the air 
from other wards 3 mixing of the nurses at meals 4 in 
efficient disinfection of wards In Dr Kers opinion though 
certain rare cases might depend on those causes they only 
accounted for a very small proportion of the second infections 
He himself attributed the latter to 1 wrong diagnosis of the 
practitioner outside 2 the admission of cases suffering 
simultaneously from two diseases only one of which was at 
first recognised and 3 most frequently the admission with 
one disease of a patient who was in the incubation stage of 
another and afterwards developed it Dr Ker maintained 
that it was absolutely impossible to prevent outbreaks of a 
second infection which depended on this last cause He did 
not expect a smaller number of such outbreaks in the new 
hospital but he suggested that a fewer number of persons 
would be exposed in each instance owing to it being con 
structed on the pavilion system

The Activity of the Saliva in Diseased Conditions of 
the Body 
Dr AiTOHisoN Robertson read a paper in which he said 
that in order to eliminate the fallacy which might arise from 
the hourly variation in the diastatic power of the secretion 
the experiments were always performed at the same hour 
each evening Above 100 cases of disease of various kinds 
were investigated in order to see if the activity of the salivary 
ferment had undergone any change 
Amongst gastrointestinal disorders the average amount of sugar 
formed by the action of 2 ccm of saliva on 10 com of starch mucilage 
for ten minutes at a temperature of 38o C was 0089 gram the normal 
average being taken as 0080 gram In chronic gas trie catarrh this 
fleure varied from 0078 gram to 01 gram In acid dyspepsia the amount 
of sugar formed was above the healthy average while in ulcration of 
the stomach the amount was generally only slightly below the normal 
avraie In dilatation of the stomach the salivary ferment was 
found to be almost absent or at least inactive In cirrhosis 
of tbe liver the amount of sugar was Dot reduced and in some cases it was 
reatly 
increased In the group of pulmonary diseases the salivary 
erment was generally fairly active and on an average 0087 gram sugar 
was formed In phthisis the ferment was present in normal amount 
and in pneumonia the amylolytic power of the secretion was above the 
normal during the period preceding the crisis but lower after this event 
In the large group of heart diseases the saliva retained its usual composi 
tion and the amount of sugar formed hovered at or about the normal 
limit A larger proportion of subnormal cases occurred in the group of 
nervous diseases fully 41 per cent giving a proportion of sugar lower 
than the normal In three cases of Addisons disease which were 
examined the saliva of two showed a marked deficiency in diastatic power 
while the third exceeded the normal limit In the group of renal diseases 
555 per cent gave a production of sugar lower than the normal amount 
In diabetes the saliva had a very active converting power and in general 
the amount of sugar produced was much above the usual figure In 
simple anaemia the converting power of the saliva reached the normal 
limit but if the affection were associated with dyspepsia then the average 
was subnormal In subacute and chronic rheumatism the ferment 
existed in its normal proportion In general febrile conditions the secre 
tion of saliva was greatly reduced in amount and this reduction increased 
paripassu with the increase in temperature This scanty secretion how 
ever seemed to possess increased amylolytic power 
With regard to the quantity of saliva secreted the author said 
that in most cases of acid dyspepsia the amount of saliva 
secreted was above the normal In chronic gastric catarrh the 
quantity was hardly up to the average and the same deficiency 
was seen in ulcration of the stomach In those cases asso 
ciated with diarrhoea or ascites the secretion was often far 
below the normal amount In bronchitis and in the early 
stage of pneumonia the secretion was generally up to the full 
average and might even exceed it In chronic phthisis the 
secretion was always very scanty In heart affections of a grave 
character the amount of saliva secreted was always low In 
affections of the spinal cord the amount secreted reached and 
even surpassed the average amount  in some cases of cerebral 
tumour the reverse occurred In chronic Brights dis 
ease a scanty secretion of saliva was also found 
In simple anaemia chronic rheumatism and in Addisons dis 
ease the secretion was subnormal in amount In many cases 
where the secretion was scanty its diastatic power was also 
feeble and on the contrary where the secretion was copious 
its proteolytic power was also great Dr Robertson described 
an easy method of estimating the diastatic power of saliva 
and stated that it was evident that a full appreciation of the 
diastatic power of the secretion was necessary when one came 
to consider the dietetics of disease In those cases where the 
secretion was exceedingly scanty or even in abeyance or in 
those cases where ptyalin was absent from the saliva or again 
in cases where the secretion was inhibited by drugs ordinary 
starchy foods ought not to be given If they were administered 
at all the starch must first be rendered soluble by treatment 
with some of the artificial digestant agents The author 
advocated a more systematic examination of the saliva in all 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract as also in other diseases 
where ordinary starchy food was found to disagree with the 
patient

verse presentation as the cases were seen too late The use 
of a curette directly after delivery or during the lyingin

tear was severe or unless there was a good nurse in attendance
