were no spots and the joints were not affected The bowels were irregular 
sometimes requiring an aperient  the tongue for the most part was clean 
but was for a short time thickly coated Towards the latter part of the 
pyrexial period the patient lost flesh and became anaemic Convalescence 
was slow and he did not recover his usual health before the end of July 
TreatmentHe was treated wtth quinine salol and tonics without ap 
preciable result 
Examination of the BloodHis blood was examined by me on two occa 
sions once about the middle and once towards the end of the pyrexial 
stage Malaria parasites were not found and the blood did not aggluti 
nate the typhoid bacillus in dilution of i to 20 In the early part of 
December four months after complete recovery Dr Dodgson examined 
the blood and found that it agglutinated the Malta fever coccus in dilu 
tion of 1 to 40 
Case 11A civil medical officer aged 28 was admitted into the 
Yeomanry Hospital at Pretoria on October 5th 
HistoryHe arrived at Capetown in July was at Deelfontein for a few 
weeks and had since been in Pretoria He had not been abroad before 
He had never had enteric fever and had not been inoculated He suffered 
from diarrhoea shortly after arriving in South Africa and the motions 
have been liquid or pultaceous ever since 
Early SymptomsFor a week before admission he was laid up with 
malaise and pyrexia the temperature rising to 1010 or 102o in the evening 
and falling to normal in the morning On admission October 5th there 
were no physical signs but he complained of pain in the back of the neck 
which lasted for a few days and then disappeared On October 18th the 
spleen could be felt just below the costal margin and the tongue was 
slightly dry and brown On October 24th the spleen was a trifle larger  
the tongue was now moist but still brown 
Examination of BloodOn October 27th the blood was examined by 
Dr Dodgson  it agglutinated the Malta fever coccus in dilution of 1 to 80 
but gave no reaction with the typhoid bacillus 
ProgressUp to this period the patient had not felt ill and with the 
exception of slight enlargement of the spleen there was no physical sign 
The temperature had run an irregular course being normal during part 
of each day but always being raised to 1010 or 102o some time or other in 
the day On the morning of October 28th the temperature was normal 
but from that time it gradually rose and reached 104o on the evening of 
October 31st From October 29th until November 9th there was con 
tinuous pyrexia the temperature varying between ioo and 103o On 
November 10th the temperature was normal and continued so with the 
exception of a rise to 103o on November nth and slighter rises on No 
vember 13th 14th and 17th During the period between October 28th and 
November 10th the patient felt ill and became emaciated and his con 
dition gave rise to anxiety There was no definite physical sign with the 
exception of gradual enlargement of the spleen This organ on November 
 1 th could be felt nearly 3 inches below the costal margin and was de 
cidedly hard 
Second Examination of the BloodThe blood was examined by Dr 
Dodgson on November nth when it agglutinated the Malta fever coccus in 
dilution of 1 to 60 but gave no reaction with the typhoid bacillus 
Recovery After November nth the spleen rapidly diminished in size 
and in a few days no enlargement could be made out The patient 
gradually improved and he was discharged on December nth from the 
hospital whence he proceeded to Capetown After a few weeks he had 
ite returned to his normal state of health During the illness the 
abdomen was never distended and there were no typical enteric spots 
The motions were sometimes liquid and sometimes pultaceous and were 
ever typical of enteric fever 
TreatmentHe was treated with quinine sodium salicylate salol 
arsenic potassium iodide and other drugs without appreciable effect 
I feel sure from clinical observation that neither of these 
patients was the subject of enteric fever and this is sup 
ported by the negative result with the agglutination test 
In both cases towards the end of the pyrexial period the 
question of general tuberculosis was raised and in Case i 
the hard enlarged spleen was in favour of such a diagnosis 
The complete recovery which ensued put general tuberculo 
sis however out of court 
I think that these cases resemble Malta fever more closely 
than any other disease The only absolutely certain means 
of determining Malta fever is to obtain the cocci from the 
spleen but in lieu of this we have the positive test of the 
agglutination of the cocci by the blood I do not know how 
far this test is reliable and consequently I do not know how 
imuch value to place upon it 
Nearly a year ago when I was in Kimberley I heard of 
cases which I considered to be most probably Malta fever so 
that it is not unlikely that this disease occurs in South 
Africa 
Two other cases which I have seen out here resembled 
Case 11 in many respects In neither case did the blood 
agglutinate the typhoid bacillus and in one case it failed to 
agglutinate the Malta fever coccus but in the other case this 
test was not applied

Abstract of Addresses delivered before the Barry Medical Society 
January 16th 1901  and the Cardiff Medical Society 
March 1st 
By J LYNN THOMAS FRCSEng 
Senior Surgeon to the late Welsh Military Hospital Honorary Surgeon to 
the Hamadryad Hospital to the Cardiff Infirmary etc 
I have already recorded my views1 regarding the organisation 
of and the work done by the Royal Army Medical Corps in 
South Africa and now we have perused the Report of the 
Royal Commission which was sent out to investigate the 
sensational and adverse charges made by a member of the 
British Parliament against it and are pleased to find that it 
is in harmony with the verdict of the majority of the civil 
surgeons who had ample opportunities and time to observe 
and to study the work done by that branch of our pro 
fession 
Methods of Pitching Hospital Marquees 
After exhibiting a lantern slide showing the appearance of 
a hospital pitched according to the plan described in Regu 
lations and Instructions for Encampments and Canton 
ments Mr Thomas showed one of the Welsh hospitals which 
was pitched according to a method introduced and carried out 
by LieutenantColonel A H Keogh RAMC the able 
administrator of the Welsh Hospital I venture to draw 
especial attention to this method Fig i as it presents 
seme important and decided advantages over the regulation 
plan Fig 2

Fig 1 is a ground plan of the pegs of the marquee according 
to Colonel Keoghs method The first thing to do is to s 
the weatherline pegs which form the angles or corners of a 
rectangular parallelogram the sides of which are 50 feet by 
33 feet that is the regulation distances of the weatherline 
pegs The next step is to find the point of intersection of 
the diagonals by means of two pieces of string and place the 
centre of the ridge pole upon it The strings are then

fixed to the weatherline pegs to form the sides of the paral 
lelogram and the small pegs for the bracing lines are driven 
in a straight line along the string about 2 feet apart one 
being left blank in the centre of sides for the doorway The 
ground plan is now ready and the further procedure about 
the raising of the marquee is carried out in the usual 
manner 
Fig 2From Manual Royal Army Medical Corps 1899 Ground plan 
of the pegs of the maiquee showing direction of weather lines 
 weather line pegs  x bracing line pegs 
The regulation method is difficult to carry out quickly as 
there are many complex measurements to be attended to 
and the weatherline pegs are the last to be driven in whilst 
they are the first to be driven in in Keoghs method and 
they seem to me to be the key to the whole 
plan 
of the hos 
pital The width of the avenues of locomotion from front to 
 rear and from flank to flank is determined upon by fixing 
j 
the weather line pegs There is 
very 
little trouble in grasp 
I ing the principle of placing any number of parallelograms of 
i definite sizes in straight lines at definite intervals whilst 
the chances of going wrong are reduced to a minimum 
The advantages of Keoghs plan over the present regula 
tion method may be summed up under the following headings  
i It is simple to understand 
2 The camp is more easily kept clean on account of having 
a single row of pegs which admit a brush between them 
i 3 The camp looks smarter 
And lastly but not the least in importance there is more 
room inside the marquee because the rounded corners of the 
marquee are raised higher on account of the longer pull of the 
bracing lines and the difficulty of arranging six or eight 
oblong beds conveniently into a more or less oval marquee 
Clinton Dent is to a certain extent overcome by Keogh 
method My own bias is for the regulation marquee 
Types of Bullets and Wounds Produced by Them 
Fig 3 shows the different types of bullets I came acrossr 
and with most of them I feel sure you are already ac 
quainted 
It is hardly necessary to reiterate the fact that wounds in 
flicted by ricochet bullets are severe or that the lesions of an 
expanding bullet are most disastrous after penetrating bone 
while those of the LeeMetford and Mauser are of a com 
paratively trivial character I cannot refrain from relating the 
case of a Colonial trooper who was shot through the right 
posterior triangle of the neck the bullet entering an inch and 
ahalf above the centre of the clavicle and emerging through 
the centre at the middle of the sternum the only symptom 
being 
a transitory feeling of uselessness of the right upper ex 
tremity with a sensation of a  
hot flush 
 
running down the 
1 imb Recovery was complete and rapid without any paresi s 
I am inclined to attribute the sensations of the patient to 
being caused by the hydrodynamical displacement of the 
fluid of the tissues in front and around the bullet upon the 
brachial plexus during its transit whilst the relative harmless 
ness of the bullet to important structures may be explained 
to a certain degree by the fluid wave immediately in front of 
the bullet partly separating or bluntly dissecting or 
pushing 
aside the movable structures such as veins arteries and 
nerves Boys many years ago photographed the airwave 
which precede and accompany bullets travelling through 
air and one cannot but infer ev analoga the existence of a 
fluidwave preceding 
the bullet travelling through the body  
such a  
fluidwave acting as a blunt dissector would assist 
us greatly in explaining the extraordinary immunity of im 
portant structures from injury in the directjcourse of abullet

ForcepsTourniquet 
In the paper already referred to21 mentioned briefly the 
use of a forcepstourniquet instead of the 
ordinary tourniquet as being in all pro 
bability more convenient and reliable 
for amputations in military surgery 
where the surgeon cannot rely upon the 
help of any skilled assistance to control 
haemorrhage As I have had a few 
questions addressed to me by private 
correspondents I think a few diagrams 
would assist in rendering more clearly 
the method of using the tourniquetthan 
a long description 
Messrs Mayer and Meltzer have made 
for me the forcepstourniquet repre 
sented in Fig 5 and this is the only 
size I now use for amputations on the 
young and the old I had smaller sizes 
made at first but further experience 
showed that they are quite unneces 
sary and are not suitable for patients 
with big or stout limbs whilst the larger 
size will do for almost every amputation 
upon thin or 
corpulent patients The 
causes for removing limbs in military 
and in civil practice are not often iden 
tical but the methods of amputating 
are the same and vary with the bias 
of the operator concerned As I have 
had a larger experience 
of amputations 
in civil than in military practice I 
 trust that the recording of the two fol 
I lowing cases will be instructive with 
II reference to the utility of the forceps

through the skin incision well down towards the neck of 
the femur and in a transverse direction towards the spine of 
the pubes the serrated blade of the forceps being outside and when the tourniquet is driven well beyond the line 
of the common femoral blood vessels it is clamped like an 
ordinary catch forceps

Case 1A woman aged ao had a central myeloid sarcoma of the lower 
end of the femur and on October 13th 1898 I amputated through the 
lower third of the thigh controlling the haemorrhage by the above 
method After tying all the visible blood vessels I unloosened the forceps 
tourniquet and an unusually free oozing took place along the linea 
spera and on close examination I discovered that the growth extended 
upwards and along the linea spera The tourniquet was again reclamped 
in a second and after tracing the growth to its upper limit I amputated 
through the upper third of the thigh bringing periosteum over the end 
of the bone and closing all the potential spaces by buried sutures No 
drainage immediate union The oozing from the face of the stump was 
ractically 
nil and although the tourniquet compressed the common 
emoral vessels and the accompanying nerves for fifty minutes the only 
evidence of vasomotor paresis was confined absolutely to the skin under 
the outer blade of the forcepstourniquet This is the longest time that I 
have had the tourniquet on and in no single case have I seen any of the 
oozing which is so commonly seen after the indiarubber or Esmarehs 
tourniquet

Fig 7 shows the method I use for applying the forceps 
tourniquet in cases of amputation through the lower third of 
the humrus by the racket incision 
Fig 7Application of forcepstourniquet to arm 
Case 11A gentleman aged 70 had a very large sarcoma growing in 
the intermuscular planes of the upper half of the right forearm and on 
August 22nd 18991 removed the limb immediately above the origin of 
the forearm muscles from the humrus by first making the handle of the 
racket incision through the skin only and then pushing in the smooth 
blade of the tourniquet at the upper end of the incision against the bone 
and backwards until the blade could be felt under the skin posteriorly 
It was then clamped and the operation was completed without any loss 
of blood as all the main blood vessels were within the grip of the forceps 
tourniquet 
I will not weary the reader with the report of other cases as 
the photographs Figs 6 and 7 kindly taken for me by my 
friend Professor Dixon illustrate the principles which guide one in applying the tourniquet Listers method of depleting 
a limb before amputation is very easily carried out by intro 
ducing the smooth blade of the forcepstourniquet into its 
place before elevating the limb and after the limb has been 
kept held up for two minutes the blades of the tourniquet are 
approximated and the handles locked in a second The rubber 
band is disappointing with regard to suddenly stopping the 
circulation though a limb especially in stout or muscular 
patients because the first two or three turns of the rubber 
band only stops the venous blood returning whilst the arterial 
blood is not interfered with until later on so that in practice 
it is not at all unlikely that there would be more blood in the 
limb after applying the rubber band in the elevated position 
than there was before it was raised unless the necessary 
number of turns of the rubber band be applied within a 
limited time It is not a very uncommon experience to see a 
limb venously congested when the rubber band is applied by 
the inexperienced 
The application of the forcepstourniquet causes the simul 
taneous closure of the arterial and venous vessels In very 
exceptional cases two tourniquets may be applied one on 
each side of the limb in order to procure absolute bloodlessness 
It was only on one occasion that I had the 
opportunity of 
appreciating the value of the forcepstourniquet in stopping 
haemorrhage in cases of injury to the common femoral vessels 
The aperture made by a Mauser or a LeeMetford bullet is 
large enough to admit the application of the forcepstourni 
quet in cases of emergency and surgeons attached to bearer 
companies could easily carry one or more tourniquets by 
clamping them to a loop on the inside of their tunic 
I may Te allowed to recapitulate some of the advantages of 
he forcepstouiniquet over the Esmarch rubber tourniquet  
1 It is not affected by climate 
2 It is easily sterilised 
3 It is most useful in major amputations such as at the 
hipjoint or high up the thigh 
4 It does not require an assistant to look after it for it is 
under the operators control 
The Telephone Probe 
Mr Thomas 
having demonstrated how to use the telephone 
probe remarked that it was better to put the silver plate on 
the patients tongue than to apply it as directed to the 
patients skin because the necessary moisture was always 
found in the mouth and consequently the small current de 
veloped when the silver probe touched a bullet was more 
per 
fectly conducted but it was neoessary to safeguard against 
letting the silver plate touch any metallic stopping in the 
teeth The occurrence of such an accidental conduct might 
lead the surgeon to follow the probe after a willothewisp 
for the real cause of the sound would be at the other terminal 
The 
telephone probe was found to be of the highest value 
possible in locating bullets during an operation and Mr 
Thomas said that it was probably no exaggeration to state 
that other probes will never see daylight again except in 
glass cabinets by the side of surgical instruments from 
Pompeii 
General Remarks 
Over 40 per cent of the cases admitted into the Welsh 
Hospital were surgical and one could not help being struck 
by the extraordinary uniformity of rapid healing in almost 
all the cases A few cases were admitted in a septic con 
dition  but as soon as the necessary incisions were made and 
drains put in it seems to me that they healed up in a shorter 
time than they would have done in this country In addition 
to 
being able to carry out modern surgical treatment in all 
its details one is forced to recognise that other factors pro 
bably played not an unimportant part in the cures During 
the five months we were up country we only saw clouds on 
about half a dozen days  it was sunshine sunshine mono 
tonous sunshine In addition the very dry condition of the 
atmosphere must also have 
played 
an important part amongst 
the 
many factors that are involved in the 
repair 
of wounds 
and in the cure of septic processes At Springfontein the 
dry cold nights and the dry hot days brought on soreness 
of the hands amongst our staff the epidermis in the natural 
furrows of the skin slowly and almost painlessly broke down 
and formed raw red and indolent sores which neither 
showed any signs of inflammation nor any inclination to heal 
A week in the humid atmosphere by the sea cured the sores 
in two of our sisters 
Our hospital at Springfontein was situated about half a 
mile from the station and when a convoy was expected we 
watched the arrival of the trains and we found it was not an 
easy matter to recognise the hospital train at that distance 
from the ordinary trains partly on account of the smallness 
of the size of the red cross painted on the carriages When 
we got to Pretoria and I saw the Princess Christian Hospital 
train all 
painted 
white with red crosses on we were much 
impressed at being able to recognise it as a hospital train 
a very long way off but not so much by its distinctive 
cross as by its white colour It must be a matter of the first 
importance in modern warfare with guns and rifles of vory 
long range to be able to recognise at a glance every hospital 
train without having to search very carefully with glasses for 
the presence or absence of the red cross 
In the early days of this campaign it was found by bitter 
experience that distinguishing marks of the combatant 
officers from the men were taken advantage of to such a 
degree by the enemy that the authorities eventually decided 
upon adopting the principle of mimicry which in the insect 
world plays such an important part in the 
preservation 
of 
life and I feel sure that the idea has occurred to many civil 
surgeons who have had the honour to assist the Royal Army 
Medical Corps in their work in the South African campaign 
that the 
protection 
afforded to its members by the wearing of 
brassard is of very little value What is wanted is something 
like a white tunic that can be seen a long way off in order to 
stamp the personnel of the RAMC as targets never to be 
shot at in the cause of humanity 
There must have been many an occasion when the wearing 
of a brassard was perfectly useless as a protection from fire 
because it happened to be invisible on account of the dis 
tance position of the body or excitement 
When marching past kopjes which harboured snipers 
one realised the fact that a brassard on the offside arm was a 
source of protection and security on a 
par with that afforded 
to the ostrich when he buries his head in the sand
