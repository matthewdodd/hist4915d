menee the study of those sciences at Newnham she could not 
be in a better place Bedford College was attached to the 
University of London and the students prepared for the 
degrees of the London University and if they began with 
chemistry and physics that was ample as it was all that the 
Council was concerned with If there was no 
proper instruc 
tion in chemistry they could not be signed up for it All the 
Council and the Registrar had to do was to let the student 
begin his first year at a proper institution  he began with che 
mistry and physics and he hadnothing to do with biology when 
he finished those subjects he went on to biology With re 
gard to the exclusion of technical schools it was only where 
those institutions in which technical education alone was 
provided for which were excluded  but if technical education 
and medical education as well was conducted by them then 
thy were included 
Dr Norman Moore was very sorry to press anything 
a lainst Newnham College but he maintained that to take 
aivrantage of surrounding circumstances was a different thing 
t  having a place adapted for teaching fitted up within its 
o vn walls  otherwise if that view were adopted a person 
living in London might have recourse to the British Museum 
However he had such a regard for Newnham College that he 
should be very unwilling to press it and if the Council could 
be satisfied that the College was teaching those subjects 
within its own walls then it should be included 
The amendment was then put and declared lost 
The President pointed out that the motion before the 
Chair was that the list of scientific institutions submitted by 
the Executive Committee be approved 
Dr McVatl thought that this matter should not be dis 
cussed until the report of the Education Committee had 
been considered because it was practically the admission of 
a number of institutions that wpre not medical schools If 
the motion was carried it would very greatly augment that 
list Therefore he proposed  
That the farther consideration of the report oc the Executive Com 
mittee regarding the list of scientific institutions recognised by licensing 
bodies be postponed until after the Education Co nmittees report with 
regard to the conditions of admission to the Studmts Register has been 
considered 
Dr Glover seconded the motion 
Dr MacAlister was of opinion that the postponement would 
only further complicate matters as it was not certain that the 
Council could come to a final conclusion upon the Education 
Committees report with regard to the oonditions of admis 
sion to the Students Register  and there was the further fact 
that the list could be extended at anytime by taking the 
nroper means Many members were surprised at the omission 
from the list of certain wellknown science colleges but the 
reason of that was that those science colleges had not been 
recognised by the licensing bodies As soon as such recogni 
tion was obtained there would be no difficulty in increasing 
the list 
Mr George Brown supported the amendment because he 
intended later on to move that this Council should recognise 
pupilage with a medical man as part of the first years 
medical education 
The President pointed out that there were already cases 
before the Registrar awaiting some deliverance by the Coun 
cil as to the recognition of certain scientific institutions that 
was to say certain applicants for registration who desired to 
know whether certain of these institutions would be recog 
nised therefore there was a practical question involved in 
the consideration of this list It was obvious from what had 
fallen from Dr MacAlister and the report itself that this list 
was not a final one and he would observe that Scotland stood 
without a representative upon it He had pointed out the 
fact to Dr MacAlister but the answer he got was one he was 
obliged to accept namely that none of the schools in Scot 
land were recognised by the licensing bodies there but so 
soon as they were recognised by those licensing bodies the 
Committee would be prepared to admit them 
Sir William Thomson supported the 
postponement be 
cause it seemed to him that the question was important and 
was involved in the matter of the Education Committees 
report 
The amendment was then put when 14 voted for and 5 
against and it was declared carried 
At the request of Dr Pettigrew the names and numbers 
were taken down The amendment was then put as a sub 
stantive motion and was declared carried 
Restoration of Names 
On the motion of Dr MacAlister the Council went into 
camera to receive a report from the Executive Committee 
in regard to certain applications for the restoration to the 
Medical Register of names removed under Section xxix of the 
Medical Act 1858 
At 6 pm the Council adjourned no intimation being con 
veyed to the press 
THE WORKING OF THE REFUGEE CAMPS 
The volume of repoits etc on the working of the refugee 
camps has now become accessible and we are therefore in a 
position to attempt a summary of their contents This task is 
by no means an easy one as the reports simply follow each 
other in chronological order and to obtain a complete and 
continuous view of the different camps it is necessary to 
examine five different reports for each camp We propose to 
confine ourselves in the present article to the camps in the 
Transvaal which as shown in our former article have had a 
higher mortality than the camps in the Orange Colony and 
Natal 
Transvaal Camp 
The inmates of the different camps were divided in the 
first instance into three classes  
i Those who have come into the camps for protection of themselves 
and their herds and are selfsupporting 
2 Those who have surrendered and come into camp for protection but 
are unable to support themselves In this class would be included 
widows and orphans and the relatives of our prisoners of war 
3 Those whose husbands are on commando and have been brought 
into camp for their own protection against natives etc or for military 
reasons 
It is noted March 22nd that it is difficult to treat with the 
liberality they deserve Classes 1 and 2 without incurring the 
reproach of having treated Class 3 with undue generosity 
The largest camps in the Transvaal are at Heidelberg Irene 
Johannesburg Potchefstroom Standerton and Volksrust 
The following statistical table shows the sickness and 
mortality experience in the Transvaal camps in the month of 
April The deaths for men women and children are massed 
together and cannot be differentiated but it is possible to 
give separately the sicknessrate among children For death 
rates the nearest whole number has been taken decimals 
being avoided

It will be noted that the highest general deathrate at this 
early stage of the history of the camps was in the Standerton 
Johannesburg Irene and Barberton camps the highest sick 
nessrate among chuchen in the Barberton Mafeking Klerks 
dorp Johannesburg and Potchefstroom camps

Thus in May the highest general deathrates occurred in the 
Potchefstroom Volksrust Middleburg and Pietersburg 
damps and the highest sicknessrate among children in the 
Irene Johannesburg Middleburg Pietersburg and Volksrust 
Oamps At the Johannesburg Camp of 79 total deaths 51 
ivere caused by measles 14 by pneumonia and bronchitis and 
1 by diarrhoea At the Irene Camp of 70 total deaths 31 were 
caused by measles 10 by diarrhoea 5 by dysentery 9 by 
pneumonia and bronchitis and 3 by enteric fever At Stan 
derton there were no deaths from measles but 3 from 
dysentery 11 from enteric fever and 3 from pneumonia and 
bronchitis At Potchefstroom of 44 total deaths 7 were due to 
measles 5 to diarrhoea 12 to pneumonia and bronchitis 10 to 
enteric fever From several camps measles was absent but 
enteric fever prevailed Thus in Volksrust no death from 
measles occurred but 4 from diarrhoea 2 from dysentery 7 
from enteric fever 
Having given somewhat full statistics for the first two 
months records embodied in the official report it will perhaps 
uffice for the remaining three months included in the report 
to give only the average daily number of sick in each of the 
Transvaal Camps For convenience of comparison the data

The Transvaal Camps may be roughly classified in accordance 
 with whether they show an improvement deterioration or a 
fairly stationary condition as regards sickness month by 
I month In the improving group Mafeking Camp takes a 
I prominent position  Johannesburg occupies a similar position 
I though how far this is due to the formation of Johannesbrg 
relief camps for which no vital statistics are given must be 
left in doubt Standerton occupies a fairly uniformly favur 
I able position while the statistics of Krugersdorp are even 
more favourable On the other hand Irene Camp has had a 
consistently bad record  so likewise has Middleburg  and the 
I conditions at Volksrust Petersburg Nylstroom and 
Vereeniging deteriorated It would be easy to extend our com 
parisons to the camps in the Orange River Colony and Natal  
but such statistics would be wearisomeand the present 
examples will probably suffice to illustrate the causes of the 
more or less favourable statistics in the different camps 
Irene for instance has had a consistently bad record 
What are the facts recorded about it Dr George Turner 
the Medical Officer of Health of the Transvaal officially in 
spected the camp on the March 6th He reports that the 
latrines are well placed but that there are insufficient pails  
and that the floors of the latrines require paving Pails for 
night use near the tents were also needed Slaughtering of 
sheep which was forbidden in the camp nevertheless was 
winked at to some extent The number of sick was great 
and something should be done to diminish the number of 
cases of diarrhoea He particularly urges that all milk be 
diluted with boiled water before being served out in view of 
the stupidity of the Boer mothers He notes that no care 
could have prevented the measles cases 
For the month of May at the same camp Dr Green the 
Medical Officer ascribes the heavy mortality to malaria 
dysentery and diarrhoea measles and pneumonia either 
caused or made worse by cold and insufficient clothing He 
also states that the average infantile mortality among Boers 
on their own farms is very great The tents were unsuitable 
for invalids allowing great extremes of temperature The 
medical and nursing staff was deficient in numbers In June 
Dr Woodroffe then medical officer of the Irene camp 
ascribes the high mortality to measles to excessive changes 
of temperature in the camps to the aversion of the Boers to 
fresh air and clean water to the absence of fresh milk and 
vegetables from the diet to the helplessness and callousness 
of many during sickness and their belief in disgusting 
remedies and their unwillingness to help one another 
For August it is reported that the constant importation of 
new inhabitants kept the measles going that the disgusting 
remedies used by the Boers made matters worse but that 
the sanitary condition of the camp is good It is stated 
that  A sharp watch has to be kept to prevent people emptying their slops 
at their front door In the tents of some slops and stools are allowed to 
remain for hours without being removed blankets and shawls are often 
used as diapers for babies with the result that the stench is unbear 
able 
The following disgusting details of Boer domestic medica 
tion remind one of mediaeval Europe  
No one can imagine the difficulty a medical man has in preventing 
these people from using their dangerous useless and disgusting 
remedies Goat dung and wormwood made into a decoction and drunk 
in quantities is the favourite drippel or middel for bringing the 
measles out pieces of raw meat are bandaged over each eye in acute con 
junctivitis and most of these cases are caused by dirt Babies ears are 
receptacles for an endless variety of rubbish and consequently otorrh a 
is very common Rags wetted with human urine are used for open 
flesh wounds and so on 
Krugersdorp may be taken as an example of a camp with a 
very good record It is noted that in May the condition of 
the families brought in was deplorable as they were very 
short of clothing and bedding The food supply was how 
ever very good and the water excellent and there was little 
sickness The report for the month of June states that the 
camp is on sloping ground that it has been drained by deep 
trenches and that a reservoir for water large enough for the 
entire camp has been built The pail system was in use 
Only 
8 deaths had occurred 3 from starvation the patients 
having been brought in in a dying condition In July 
measles was epidemic but the deathrate remained low The 
sanitary arrangements were excellent 
It would be easy to extend the 
preceding examples Suf 
ficient however has been adduced to indicate some of the 
main lessons of the camps  
1 A large share of the high deathrate in them is ascribable 
I to the condition in which the women and children arrive

Often they have been halfstarved and are broken down in 
health It cannot be wondered at that under these circum 
stances measles and other diseases are inordinately fatal 
2 The dirty personal habits of the Boers their use of 
improper and often disgusting remedies and their ignorant 
errors of dietetics in regard to young children have rendered 
it extremely difficult to secure favourable results in the 
treatment of cases of sickness among the Boer children 
3 There appears to be no doubt as indicated in our pre 
vious special article that the measles which has been preva 
lent has been of a specially malignant type Its malignancy 
has doubtless been intensified by the dirty condition of the 
Boer children and by the overcrowding that has been per 
mitted in the camps as well as by the previous bad health of 
these children 
4 The present reports afford abundant evidence confirm 
atory of the conclusion at which we had previously arrived 
that dysentery diarrhoea and enteric fever in a large propor 
tion of the camps have been prevalent as well as measles 
5 The fact that some of the camps have had but little of 
any of these diseases and that measles when it has been in 
troduced into them has had a relatively low fatality appears 
to indicate not merely differences in the condition of the 
Boer women and children on their arrival in camp but dif 
ferences in the subsequent management of the respective 
camps Numbers however as well as quality are required 
Doctors nurses and inspectors cannot do a superhuman 
amount of work  and in a large proportion of the reports 
there is complaint of an insufficient staff 
6 It is clear that every attempt appears to have been made 
to provide necessary food clothing and medical comforts 
Sometimes these attempts failed but this was obviously not 
owing to lack of efforts in this direction 
7 We had anticipated that an examination of the preced 
ing statistical tables prepared at great labour would have 
shown a regular relationship between magnitude of the camps 
and amouut of sickness and mortality Roughly speaking 
there is such a relationship but it is not uniform One or two 
of the smaller camps show a high mortality  several of the 
large camps particularly Krugersdorp Klerksdorp and 
Standerton show a low mortality This maybe partially due to 
the fortuitous nonintroduction of infection Internal evi 
dence seems however to show that it is due in a much larger 
degree to more efficient administration than that of the more 
severely scourged camps These facts do not in our opinion 
militate against the main conclusion whichwe urged in the 
previous special articlethat the camps should be split up 
and scattered and be placed on pure soil the maintenance of 
which in its pristine freedom from contamination by 
excreta 
or  
slops 
 
should be the constant care of a sufficient staff 
One of the chief causes of the recent high mortality has been 
the difficulty of getting the Boers to use latrines of prevent 
ing them contaminating the soil around their tents In some 
camps there has been much greater success in this matter 
than in others If the unsuccessful camps were moved and 
placed under efficient supervision and control great improve 
ment could almost certainly be effected 
JAMAICA AS A HEALTH RESORT 
From our Special Commissioner 
When in the early part of the year I was offered the 
opportunity of voyaging to Jamaica with the object of 
briefly reporting from personal observation on the capa 
bilities of that island as a health or pleasure resort I 
accepted with pleasure It was no small consideration to 
escape for more than four weeks from the rigour of this 
insular climate during the months of February and March 
As with most others too the very name of the West Indies 
was to me associated with a charm and romance above per 
haps 
those attaching to any other portion of the world The 
writings of Kingsley and Michael Scott recurred to one and 
with the younger and more ardent doubtless the writings of 
Marryat with the descriptions of lovely Creoles and dignity 
balls would have recurred with still more vivid force To 
visit for however brief a period some of the scenes these 
writers have described to view with ones own eyes the 
wondrous wealth and beauty of the tropical vegetation and 
to taste the numerous tropical fruits whose excellence could 
only be tested on their native soil made up a programme 
too enticing to be resisted 
The Voyage 
A drawback to Jamaica as a health or pleasure resort is to 
many its distance from this country some 4000 miles odd 
Formerly this disadvantage was enhanced by the fact that ito 
could be reached only by a line of steamers that called 
previously at several other West Indian islands or by going 
over to America and taking a long train journey south with 
a final sea trip of several days duration In either case by 
these routes the journey from England to Jamaica took the 
best part of three weeks By the establishment of the 
Imperial Direct West India Mail Service Elder Dempster 
and Co which runs a fortnightly service of boats direct to 
Jamaica and has in contemplation a weekly service in the 
near future a considerable reduction in the length of the 
journey has been achieved It now lasts about twelve days a 
less time than that occupied by going to Egypt by 
 
long 
sea and many intending travellers to the East might fairly 
turn their faces Westward Ho  with both pleasure and profit 
to themselves 
Journeying down from Paddington on February 16th 
skating was going on in numerous places adjacent to the line 
and it was pleasant to think that in a couple of days or so 
one would be in a distinctly warmer clime where great coats 
would be an unnecessary encumbrance At Bristol we found 
the engine of the special boat train decorated with laurels and 
flags ours being the pioneer journey of the service and the 
same decorations were lavishly displayed on all sides on 
nearing Avonmouth So much time however was wasted on 
this short journey that one could have wished for less 
grandeur and more speed but it is not fair to cavil at the 
arrangements on an initial trip and doubtless on subsequent 
occasions every punctuality has been maintained As the 
arrival platform adjoined the wharf the vessel was easily 
reached from the train by walking through a covered 
shed The appearance of our shipthe Port Morant 
was a truly pleasing one Painted a pure white 
with an excellent promenade deck and other accommo 
dations she looked more like a steam pleasure yacht 
than a vessel designed for serious work in the North Atlantic 
She was one of the smaller boats of the fleet being slightly 
under 3000 tons burdenff most of the others ranging over 
4000 tons In spite of several very minor defects which only 
actual experience at sea could reveal the Port Morant proved 
a trusty and seaworthy vessel capable of steaming at con 
siderably more than the guaranteed speed As she was the 
pioneer vessel of the service the whole of the inhabitants of 
Avonmouth and the district turned out to wish success to 
the enterprise which promises so much for the trade and 
prosperity of Bristol and the neighbourhood It soon appeared 
that the passengers were a community almost solely on pleasure 
bent and there was an absence of any distressing leavetakings 
and to the joyous strains of a band the waving of flags ancfe 
the continuous cheering of the crowd on shore we started on 
our long journey 
We carried rather more than forty our full complement of 
first saloon passengers one or two having to depend for sleep 
ing 
accommodation on the resources of the second saloon but 
this was no real hardship Including the surgeon to the ship 
there were no fewer than seven doctors on board most of then 
making the trip for the sake of health or pleasure A dis 
tinguished member of the medical coterie was Dr F W 
Mott who was suffering from some unpleasant sequel of 
influenza and it must be a source of universal gratifica 
tion that he came back restored to health to pursue his 
researches in neurology and pathological chemistry 
The first part of the voyage was somewhat rough but the 
weather in the North Atlantic at that time of the year is pro 
verbially uncertain It was not so rough however as to be 
unpleasant except to very bad sailors and it only gave rise to 
such minor inconveniences as the occasional having to dodge 
a dish at meals and the necessity of dealing the cards at 
bridge directly into each players hand as the motion of the 
vessel prevented their stopping on the table The latter part 
of the voyage was delightful and thoroughly enjoyed by every 
one on board The sea was quite calm and its intense blue 
surface was only broken by the frequent flight of myriads of
