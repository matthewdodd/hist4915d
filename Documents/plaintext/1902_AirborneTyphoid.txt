In conclusion I hope by a simple device in a year or so to 
be able to contrast the frequency of typhoid with the com 
parative prevalence of flies and also with the average amount 
of dust blown through a given vertical area 
I am collecting evidence on the subject of typhoid fever 
and the variations in the condition of the water supply but 
as yet it is too soon to publish the results I have obtained 
AIRBORNE TYPHOID 
By LieutenantColonel R H QUILL RAMC 
Senior Medical Officer Ceylon 
At the late meeting of our Association Dr Leigh Canney 
read a very interesting paper on the Etiology of Typhoid 
Fever in which while strenuously supporting the proposition 
that epidemics of typhoid fever are always waterborne he 
vigorously denounced those who ventured to believe that 
such epidemics could sometimes be traced to an airborne 
origin 
I should like to say at the outset of the remarks I have to 
offer on Dr Canneys proposition that I in common as I be 
lieve with the officers of the RAMC as a body hold that 
epidemics of typhoid fever are chiefly waterborne and it is to 
the water supply we first turn our attention when investigat 
ing the origin of typhoid cases occurring sporadically or 
epidemically But I am entirely at issue with Dr Canney 
when he lays down the hard and fast proposition that typhoid 
epidemics are invariably waterbornenever airborne 
The subject is one of farreaching importance well deserv 
ing of full discussion I will therefore as briefly as possible 
adduce evidence to prove that the waterborne theory will not 
always account for the occurrence of a typhoid epidemic My 
facts will be drawn from our experience in connexion with 
the large camp in this island where Boer prisoners of war are 
confined 
In August 1900 a large camp was formed at Diyatalawa in 
the hills of Ceylon for the Boer prisoners of war The first 
batch of prisoners arrived on August 9th and succeeding 
batches quickly followed until by the end of December 96 
officers and some 5000 men were under confinement 
On September 21st 1900 one of the prisoners who had 
arrived on September 5th reported sick He was found to be 
suffering from typhoid fever of probably ten or more days 
duration 
 
This was the commencement of an epidemic of 
typhoid among the prisoners which soon assumed formidable 
proportions By the end of December 600 cases had been 
diagnosed as typhoid fever And during the same period some 
200 cases of simple continued fever occurred many of which 
it is highly probable were mild cases of typhoid 
We fully satisfied ourselves that this epidemic of typhoid 
among the prisoners had been imported from South Africa 
but in that connexion I refrain from further remarks as it 
has nothing to do with the proposition I have set myself to 
prove 
It is here necessary for my argument that I should briefly 
describe the relationship which exists between the prisoners 
camp and that of the surrounding camp where is located the 
military guard 
The prisoners camp situated on an undulating slope is 
surrounded with a strong fence of barbed wire  outside that 
fence are inner and outer military guard lines The 
 
inner 
guard consists of a number of sentry boxes at intervals of 100 
yards and placed only some 20 yards from the barbed wire 
fence The 
 
outer guard 
 
consists of guard huts occupied by 
strong guards placed on rising ground some 200 yards further 
back The latrines urinals washhouses and hospitals for 
the prisoners are all situated close to the barbed wire fence 
which surrounds the prisoners camp as a whole 
The guard for the prisoners was formed by the 2nd Battalion 
Kings Royal Rifles who were a fine healthy body of men 
No suspicious fever of any kind prior tothe outbreak among 
the prisoners existed among them The battalion remained 
in a thoroughly satisfactory healthy condition until October 
18th 1000that is for over two months after its arrival at 
Diyatalawa and for a month after the first case of typhoid 
occurred among the prisoners  
On October 18th a man reported sick he was found to be 
suffering from fever which quickly proved to be typhoid 
From that date admissions for typhoid among the battalion 
occurred at short intervals until by the end of December 
there had been altogether 24 admissions and 5 deaths 
Now in attempting to account for this outbreak of typhoid 
fever among the military guard at Diyatalawa Camp I com 
mence by advancing the following evidence against the out 
break having been in any sense waterborne 
1 The water supply was obtained from a mountain stream 
some three miles distant and was brought into camp by 
underground iron pipes The intake in the hills was so 
isolated that its pollution was indeed very remote On the 
arrival in camp of the main iron pipes smaller ones passed 
directly into four large Pasteur tank filters disposed about 
the camp n suitable positions while in each barrack hut 
portable Pasteur or Berkefeld filters were placed and kept 
under careful supervision  thus all water used in the camp 
before its distribution invariably passed through a thoroughly 
reliable filtering medium The water prior to filtration was 
subjected to a weekly chemical analysis and the report 
always gave the water a high character a similar verdict 
followed frequent bacteriological examinations There has 
been no alteration in the water supply or filtering arrange 
ments since the camp was opened and no case of typhoid 
fever has occurred among the troops since December 1900 
that is since the practical cessation of the epidemic among 
the prisoners of war 
2 No fresh milk was allowed within the camp precincts 
When milk was required condensed milk Milkmaid Brand 
wars used 
3 All aerated waters used in camp came from the Ceylon 
Brewery at Newera Eliza and were identical with those used 
at that sanatorium There has been no enteric fever at Newera 
Eliza 
4 No uncooked food or uncooked vegetables were used in 
camp 
5 No native hawkers of any kind were allowed to enter the 
camp 
6 Within the camp there were five or six native shops  
these were under strict military supervision No native 
drinks of any kind were sold in them The aerated water 
sold in them were invariably procured from the Ceylon 
Brewery at Newera Eliza 
7 All men leaving the camp for purposes of duty or pleasure 
were obliged to take with them a water bottle filled with 
filtered water 
8 It is to be remembered that for obvious military reasons 
the camp was situated in an isolated position in the hills far 
removed from habitations of any kind 
As the foregoing considerations in my judgment com 
pletely put out of court a waterborne cause as being respon 
sible for the typhoid outbreak in the military camp I was 
driven to the conclusion that the infection was airborne 
being derived from the adjoining prisonersofwar 
camp where at the time an epidemic of typhoid fever wa 
raging 
In support of that opinion I submit the following obser 
vations  
1 Guard huts accommodating strong guards surround the 
prisoners lines and are close to them This for military 
reasons is unavoidable 
2 The men on sentry iuty are during day and night posted 
at short intervals almost immediately outside the barbed 
wire enclosure which separates the prisoners from the mili 
tary camp Thus those on sentry duty a numerous body of 
men are in close contact not only with the prisoners but 
with their latrines urinals and washhouses all of whichs 
I have already stated are situated close to the barbed wire 
fence The undesirability on health grounds of the line of 
sentries being placed so close to the prisoners camp was fully 
recognised but for military reasons it was not found possible 
to alter the arrangement 
 From the foregoing remarks it will 
be obvious that those on duty in the guard huts and sentry 
boxes must be to a very appreciable extent exposed to the 
emanations arising from the latrines used by the prisoners of 
war especially during the time when the latrines are emptied 
a frequent necessity Now assuming that such manation 
contained typhoid organismsnot a very farfetched hypo

thesis when we remember that at the time typhoid fever was 
very rife in the prisoners camp and further assuming that 
typhoid infection can be airbornethe possibility nay the 
probability of the infection being thus conveyed from ttie 
prisoners camp to the military guards appears to be well 
founded 
3 But in addition to the assumption that the emanations 
from the prisoners latrines may have conveyed infection to 
the military guard it has to be recorded that the soil of the 
prisoners camp gave peculiar facilities for the spread of the 
infection The rank grass which originally covered the slope 
upon which the previous camp was arranged very soon dis 
appeared giving place to a reddish soil so friable that dust 
was much in evidence notwithstanding that it was the rainy 
season of the year Now it is not unreasonable to reject as 
pure the dust of a camp in which at the time a formidable 
epidemic of typhoid fever was prevailing 
4 Lastly the possibility of the infection being conveyed to 
some extent by flies must be considered During the whole 
period that typhoid fever was prevailing in the prisoners 
camp flies in that camp amounted almost to a plague the 
military camp being also infested but to a lesser extent 
Now flies being well adapted for the carriage of infection it is 
plain that under the conditions existing in the prisoners 
amp there would be nothing to prevent flies laden with 
typhoid bacilli migrating from the prisoners to the military 
camp and thereby conveying to the latter camp the poison 
they carried 
I have endeavoured in this paper to review dispassionately 
the evidence bearing on the causation of the typhoid outbreak 
which occurred among the military guard at Diyatalawa 
Camp Ceylon during the closing months of 1900 I submit 
that I have shown 
 That all water avenues through which typhoid fever 
could have been conveyed to the military Chjnp at 
Diyatalawa were efficiently guarded and therefore tnat a 
waterborne origin must be abandoned 
b That the infection was airborne resulting from emana 
tions from specifically infected latrines infected dust or

A great many soldiers who stay for any length of time in 
Pretoria or its neighbourhood suffer from attacks of fever of a 
remittent type which is of short duration and for want of a 
better name and a good deal from want of any accurate know 
ledge of its nature is returned either as  
remittent 
 
malarial 
remittent sometimes simple continued fever and has 
even been given the special name  
Pretoria fever To ally 
the complaint with malaria however is distinctly wrong as 
it has no connexion whatever with it 
Below I only refer to the fever of the Pretoria neighbour 
hood I do not include the simple continued fever so common 
at the beginning of the war amongst soldiers especially in 
Cape Colony This fever was more often of an intermittent 
type True malaria does not so far as I can ascertain exist 
in Pretoria and its neighbourhood among the soldiers 
except cases imported from Komati Poort and its surround 
ing districts 
I am informed however that amongst the poorer class of 
Dutch living on the lowlying ground near the river in 
Pretoria a low form of fever occurs but I have seen no cases 
of a malarial nature amongst soldiers living near I am also 
informed that about Penaars River an intermittent fever 
occurs among the soldiers  the temperature rarely rises over 
ioo and is unaffected by quinine Personally I have neither 
heard of nor seen a single case of remittent fever originating 
in this district in which plasmodia have been found in the 
blood Captain Beveridge RAMC Analyst to the Army in 
South Africa who has examined the blood of many of these 
cases has not met with a single instance 
The onset of fever is as a rule sudden  the patient has 
been feeling out of sorts probably for a day or two previously 
but not sufficiently so as to cease work The attack com 
menees with acute frontal headache pains in the back and 
legs  sometimes acute pain in the lower part of the occipital 
region which occasionally occurs in enteric fever and is 
rather a characteristic symptom when present  sensations of 
 
cold water being poured down the back  often vomiting  
loss of appetite and malaise In 24 hours the temperature 
may reach 1040 rarely higher A history of diarrhoea previous 
to admission to hospital is often given 
When admitted generally after about twentyfour hours 
fever the patients condition is usually as follows Head 
ache as above also about this time slight abdominal pain 
located as a rule by the patient above the umbilicus 
and passing from right to left slightly griping in nature 
an almost constant symptom Vomiting if present 
rarely lasts more than twentyfour hours after admission 
Diarrhoea is fairly common for the first day sometimes 
longer but occasionally the patient is constipated He is 
heavy and languid with flushed face The temperature 
variable between ioo and 1040 as a rule The tongue is 
generally thickly coated with white or yellow fur sometimes 
inclined to be dry sometimes quite moist  occasionally quite 
clean even rawlooking and moist No enlargement of the 
spleen can be felt but as a rule there is tenderness over this 
region below the costal margin and sometimes over the 
liver On the whole the condition on admission is generally 
much more characteristic of an intestinal lesion than of 
malaria 
The temperature generally descends gradually dropping 
one or two degrees in the morning rising half to one and 
ahalf in the night The time of descent is variable two days 
or much longer but remittent in character The symptoms 
rapidly ameliorate  the headache disappears within two or 
three days and even though the patient has a temperature of 
1010 or 1020 at night he may be quite indignant at being kept 
in bed and on a light diet Spots resembling enteric only 
occurred in one case of mine at the sixth day but not more 
that 20 per cent of the enterics out here have characteristic 
spots 
The stools are rarely typically enteric The pulse is slow 
and quite out of proportion to the temperature In one 
or two cases it was markedly dicrotic even when the tempera 
ture had become normal In one case with a normal tem 
perature and dicrotic pulse a typical enteric relapse 
occurred 
The tongue may clean rapidly but often the coat persists 
for several days after the temperature is normal This 
generally prognosticates a relapse with all the features of true 
enteric fever 
In contrast with malaria sweating is not at all a constant 
feature towards the termination of the fever and is not pro 
fuse when present The duration of the fever is from five 
days upwards if beyond twelve days the diagnosis has to be 
altered to enteric fever 
Nature of the Fever 
Personally I have had very many I may say hundreds of 
cases of the above type and the conclusion I came to some 
time ago was that they were almost invariably abortive 
attacks of enteric fever The proofs of this seem fairly 
conclusive 
1 These short fever attacks more often occur in men who 
have been some time in the country generally well over six 
months For instance in about one month out of 11 suc 
cessive cases of remittent fever under thirteen days 
fever 1 patient had been out five months see list at endhe 
L had a relapse one 7 one 10 and the rest all over a year three 
quarters of them over eighteen months The reason is that 
most of these oldservice men are under ordinary circum 
stances immune to enteric fever In the first six months 
out here many men if they get run down will get true enteric 
fever not remittent The remainder after six months are 
I more or less immune that is their powers of resistance are 
I very high  but even theseafter prolonged exertion bad food 
etc have their resistance broken down and fall victims to 
I fever So soon as they get rest and proper feeding the resist 
I anee reaches its former high level and the attack aborts  they 
J have had remittent fever otherwise abortive enteric
