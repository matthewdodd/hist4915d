the police surgeons this varies in amount from co or 12 
to 20 30 40 50 up to 100 Salaries of 100 and up 
wards are paid in nine towns Birmingham and Manchester 
each paying 25 Kingstonupon Hull 135 Bristol and Leeds 
each 150 The author was unable to discover any fixed ratio 
between the amount of duties and the salary paid but 
thought 0 little enough in mo3t cases for the duties to be 
performed Referring to the police surgeons frequent ap 
pearance in the witnessbox it was pointed out that in the 
provinces this often involves great loss of time and consider 
able outofpocket expenses the surgeon in order to give evi 
dence at assizes having to leave his own home and his prac 
tice sometimes for a whole week travel by rail to the assize 
town stay there at a hotel and incur expense by the em 
ployment of a locum tenens and at the end of the trial receiv 
ing only the quite inadequate remuneration of a guinea a day 
Five years ago representations were made to the Home Office 
by the United Kingdom Police SurgeonsAssociation when the 
then Home Secretary admitted that a substantial grievance 
had been shown to exist but said that he and other holders 
of his office had been afraid to burn their fingers by attempt 
ing to remedy ita plea which if held sufficient might pre 
vent the remedying of almost any injustice that had existed 
for half a century Consequently not only has nothing been 
done but the present Home Secretary has even refused to 
receive a deputation on the subject either from the Police 
Surgeons Association or from the British Medical Association 
Reference wap also made to the mode of procedure when the 
police surgeon is called in to give an opinion on the body of a 
newborn child found by the police The English system of 
death certification and registration being very imperfect and 
there being no system in London corresponding to that of the 
mdecinsvrificateurs of Paris these cases have all to be re 
ported to the coroner who thereupon summons a jury of 
twelve or fifteen men mostly belonging to the artisan class 
who have first to view the body then listen to the police 
surgeons or any other evidence that may be laid before them 
and in the end are told by the coroner  Well gentlemen 
you have heard what the doctor says was the cause of death  
do you find your verdict in accordance with his opinion   
which in ninety nine cases out of a hundred they do 
The author suggested that if the police surgeon were author 
ised as in Edinburgh to make a necropsy where necessary 
and his report were then accepted in lieu of a death certi 
ficate it would be both better and cheaper in the long run 
The authors conclusions were  
1 Police surgeons should be paid at the rate of at least 103 
per oficer per annum or preferably by fixed salary of at least 
jo 
a year when the men under their care number 100 or less 
with a proportionate increase for numbers over ioo 
2 The injustice of compelling police surgeons to give evi 
dence on behalf of the Crown at assizes and paying a sum 
which actually leaves them out of pocket as a result should 
be remedied without delay 
3 The modification of the system of mdecinsvrificateurs 
at present carried out in Edinburgh should be at once intro 
duced in London and all large English towns 
SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS COMMISSION 
Overworked Orderlies 
Among the witnesses whose evidence was taken by the Com 
missioners on September 5th was the Rev Mr Franklin a 
local 
pastor who complained that in the early days the staffs 
were inadequate There were too few orderlies and the men 
were overworked 
Dr James Surgeon of No 9 Hospital said men arriving in 
convoys were put in bell tents and retained their unwashed 
clothes which were not changed sometimes for a week He 
was sorry for the men but did not aoply for changes of cloth 
ing because he knew it would be useless 
Major Wright RAMC in charge of St Michaels Home 
Hospital said wounded and enteric patients were kept apart 
He denied Mr BurdettCouttss allegation that they were 
lying side by side 
Colonel Benson Chief Staff Officer at Bloemfontein said as 
regards orderlies there had been several cases of men having 
drink but few cases of intoxication while on duty There 
were very few complaints in regard to their conduct other 
wise 
SurgeonGeneral Wilsons Evidence 
On September 6th SurgeonGeneral Wilson Principal 
I Medical Officer in South Africa detailed the arrangements 
made for the care of the sick and wounded When the Army 
was increased beyond two Army Corps the Medical Depart 
ment was undermanned He had inspected the base hospital 
in Capetown and considered that there was no serious cause 
of complaint Lord Methuens force had a full equipment for 
three field hospitals and bearer companies with accommo 
dation for 600 patients at Orange River In Lord Robertas 
I advance from Modder River the hospital matriel was con 
siderably curtailed owing to military exigencies Hospital 
trains ran to Modder River with stores medicines and appli 
ances and the sick and wounded were well looked after not 
withstanding the rapidity of the advance Generally the 
medical equipment was sent up as expeditiously as possible 
He contradicted the figures given by Mr BurdettCoutts and 
Mr Murray Guthrie to show that the deathrate in private hos 
pitals was less than in military ones Exactly the reverse was 
the case He also denied having made any statement as to the 
unsatisfactory condition of the Bloemfontein Hospital 
General KellyKennys Evidence 
General KellyKenny explained that on the advance to 
Bloemfontein the ambulances were cut down considerably 
owing to military exigencies There were only two ambu 
lances per brigade instead of ten and the suffering endured 
was owing to the necessities of the march He paid a tribute 
to the conduct of the orderlies who behaved splendidly and 
on occasion did a great deal of work in addition to their own 
They even carried a number of Boer wounded across a river 
up to their armpits in water Such service the General stated v 
was purely voluntary 
Statements of Civil Surgeons 
SergeantMajor Roberts and Corporal Beach indignantly 
denied the truth of the civil surgeons statements with regard 
to No 8 Hospital  but an orderly from that hospital partly 
confirmed them 
Overcrowding at Kroonstadt 
At Kroonstadt on the same day witnesses admitted the 
suffering of patients and that there had been overcrowding 
under field hospital management but they could not see how 
it could have been altered They agreed that the state of 
things improved when the General Hospital and the Scottish 
Hospital arrived 
The Canadian Red Cross Commissioner and Mr 
burdettcoutts 
A telegram in the Times dated Toronto September 5th 
quotes Dr Ryerson lately Canadian Red Cross Commissioner 
in South Africa in a letter in that nights Telegram regarding 
the alleged hospital mismanagement in South Africa as 
saying  
Mr BurdettCoutts has not added much strength to his case by the 
statement that he cabled his complaint from Capetown to Lord Wolseley 
Why did he run away from Bloemfontein and Lord Roberts  Why did 
he not make his complaint where it would have met with instant investi 
gation  Does it not look as though he feared the results of an immediate 
investigation  
Dr Ryerson further asks how Mr BurdettCoutt reconciles 
his facts with the mortality statistics as given by Mr Wynd 
ham and quotes figures showing that the deathrate from 
enteric fever at Bloemfontein was only 21 per cent against a 
much higher mortality in the Chitral and more recent cam 
paigns He asks how it is possible that such good results 
could be obtained had matters been so bad as they were repre 
sented to be by Mr BurdettCoutts The Canadian Commis 
sioner also supports his arguments by pointing to the small 
disproportion between deaths from disease and those from 
wounds as compared with the figures in former wars and 
concludes by saying 
 
Surely there must be something wrong 
with Mr BurdettCouttss facts 
The Commissioners at Pretoria 
The Hospitals Commission reached Pretoria on September 
8th and at once got to work SurgeonMajor Kilkelly 
Grenadier Guards stated that no complaint had been made of 
the Imperial Yeomanry and Portland Hospitals although 
there was considerable pressure during the epidemic He 


72 MmiLj CONTRACT MEDICAL PRACTICE Sept 15 190a 
denied that patients unfit to be moved had been taken to the 
Portland Hospital The latter arrived in Bloemfontein in a 
storm but tents were not pitched and no patients were 
received 
Evidence of Sir William Thomson 
8ir William Thomson who has been in civil charge of the 
Irish Hospital since its commencement complained that the 
authorities of the hospital were unaware of sick being detained 
at the railway station on May 23rd as mentioned by Mr 
BurdettCoutts He had then left Bloemfontein He remem 
bered similar incidents in April in which notification had 
been given of the arrival of a train but the train was 
several hours late owing to a breakdown and the men 
were left without food The arrangements for feeding 
patients at railway stations were not efficient until 
latterly When Lord Roberts advanced the sick had 
unfortunately to be taken on with the army from Roodeval 
as it was considered unsafe to send them back He confirmed 
Mr Murray Guthries statement that he had said that the 
men could not be properly treated in bell tents and that 
there were insufficient stores in Pretoria He formed a Com 
mittee in Pretoria which supplied all the hospitals with 
necessaries purchased in Pretoria and Johannesburg He 
recommended the reorganisation of the medical department 
with a view to greater relief being given to the sick and 
wounded in war time establishing the definite principle of a 
civil nursing system This civil nursing system should be a 
distinct department associated with the army under special 
officers Consulting physicians were more necessary than 
surgeons in a campaign where only onesixteenth of the men 
in hospital were wounded and the remainder were sick 
Evidence of Chaplains and Others 
The Rev Maurice Jones garrison chaplain spoke highly of 
the hospital arrangements with the exception of the 12th 
Brigade Field Hospital where the medical officer in charge 
of 290 patients was left practically without a staff for twelve 
days 
Captain Mould denied that men for the Irish Hospital remained unattended at Bloemfontein Station for a long time 
The Rev W Le Grave Roman Catholic Chaplain to the 
Forces considered that the Woodstock Hospital was badly 
situated and difficult to keep clean but the patients had every 
attention Everything was perfect in Pretoria 
Evidence of Mr Kendal Franks 
Mr Kendal Franks consulting surgeon described the con 
dition of the field hospital after Paardeberg as most distressing 
but said it was unavoidable owing to the accommodation 
being cut down to meet the necessities of the campaign He 
denied that 2000 sick arrived in Bloemfontein after the action 
at Paardeberg The total number of patients in Bloem 
fontein on March 16th was 302 Accommodation was always 
found for the sick and wounded but there was a great deal of 
overcrowding The dead were always buried in separate 
graves 
Major Faunce denied Mr Murray Guthries allegation that 
the hospitals in Pretoria were short of everything 
Illness of the Chairman 
According to a Reuter telegram dated September 9th Lord 
Justice Romer was unwell on that day and it was considered 
possible that the resumption of the proceedings will be post 
poned 
Splendid Work by Doctors Nurses and Orderlies 
Up to the present the complaints says Reuter made are 
chiefly in regard to matters of detail but nearly the whole of 
the evidence bears testimony to the splendid work of the 
doctors nurses and orderlies 
CONTRACT MEDICAL PRACTICE 
THE GROWTH OF CONTRACT PRACTICE 
Commercial Travellers Association 
At a time when the medical profession is struggling to 
emancipate itself from the bondage to which it has been 
reduced by powerful workingclass medical associations we 
feel it our duty to draw attention to the movement which is 
being very quietly carried on to enrol commercial travellers 
clerks and their families in a widespread medical benefit 
society We have received a copy of the following circular 
but at present we think it desirable to suppress names and 
addresses  
and Commercial Travellers Association   
Division 
President Esq JP 
February 1900 
C T A Medical Branch 
Dear SirIn order to meet the wishes of members who desire to co 
operate for the provision of firstclass medical attendance for themselves 
and families on the lines of the medical schemes adopted by 
and other G T As it is proposed to organise a similar scheme in connec 
tion with theDivision and arrangements have been pro 
visionally concluded with an eminent local physician holding high 
London University qualifications on the following terms  
ios 6d per annum for consultations to a member or any of his family 
at the doctors house 
For visits at members residence a reduced fee of ss per visit 
Medicines will be supplied if desired by the physician at a reduced 
charge 
This exceptionally favourable arrangement is necessarily subject to a 
minimum membership and it is hoped that those desirous of joining our 
Medical Branch will kindly fill up and return the enclosed form to the 
undersigned at the earliest possible date 
Yours faithfully 
Honorary Secretary 
To this is appended a form of application and an undertaking 
to pay the annual subscription in advance We have reason 
to know that this scheme will be brought before the medical 
profession in the localities where it is being worked The 
circular does not say how much the eminent physician re 
ceives per annum of the halfguinea subscribed The 
adequacy of the rate of payment must no doubt depend upon 
the class of persons who take advantage of the scheme the 
general rate of payment in the district and the status of the 
practitioner employed but it certainly appears to us to be very 
moderate As while there are many commercial travellers 
and clerks who are poor there are also very many who are quite 
welltodo there is the gravest risk that the scheme will be 
abused and that by accepting such work the profession will 
be forging another link in the chain which threatens to 
reduce the great mass of practitioners to a state of illpaid 
servitude 
Medical Clubs in Lancaster 
The medical men in Lancaster are at present engaged in an 
interesting little contest with the members of various work 
mens clubs In round numbers these have a membership of 
some 4000 At present the men pay 3s 6d a head per annum 
for medical attendance The work is divided amongst twelve 
practitioners In June the latter through the Lancaster 
Medical Book Club a very old society which has latterly been 
enlarged so as to include all members of the profession prac 
tising in the town gave notice that after the end of the 
present year nothing less than 5s a head per annum would be 
accepted for attendance on club patients After some negotia 
tions the clubs have offered 4s 
 as a final settlement of the 
question so far as the present staffs are concerned This 
offer was refused at a meeting of the Book Cl nb held on 
September 8th and it will be recognised that the rate pro 
posed by the medical men in Lancaster is certainly not un 
reasonable having regard to the nature of the skilled ser 
vices which they would undertake to render for it The 
former rate of 3s 6d is absurdly low and the increase to 4s is 
inadequate 
The Backworth Collieries and their Doctobs 
1 The Newcastle Daily Journal recently reported a meeting called by an 
association styling itself  The Backworth and District Medical Cooper 
ative Association The object of the meeting appeared to be to form a 
medical club for Backworth and district to provide cheap medical attend 
ance for its members without regard to their social position It was 
stated that already 550 persons had agreed to become members and it 
was decided to advertise for a doctor at once 
Thi3 movement appears to have arisen in consequence of the Backworth 
colliery doctors demanding a more equitable scale of remuneration for 
their services As the colliery doctors are united it has been found 
necessary to call in outsiders to crush their union and for that purpose 
the above Association has been called into existence 
The modest demand of the doctors is that gd per miner and family shall 
be paid each fortnight instead of 6d as heretofore It is to be regretted 
that any of our profession should find it necessary to accept such con 
tracts even at the enhanced rate and we earnestly hope that no prac 
titioner will be found to assist the Backworth and District Cooperative Medical Association against his brethren and the interests his pro 
fession
