It will be observed that the glaucoma in the last case was 
distinctly chronic whereas in the others it was acute and 
that in the first three cases glaucoma followed the retinal 
condition in about six weeks but did not appear in Case iv 
for over nne months The occurrence of glaucoma in the eye 
anaffected with thrombosis in Cases in and iv is remarkable 
suggesting a possible causal relation between the two condi 
tions The presence of haemorrhages on the surface and in 
the substance of the iris showed that the arteriosclerosis was 
not limited to the retinal vessels but also affected the ciliary 
arteries this latter circumstance of course being a strong 
contraindication to performing iridectomy seeing that exten 
sive intraocular haemorrhage is so likely to occur under these 
conditions 
The clinical significance of this 
complication 
in cases of 
thrombosis naturally lies chiefly in the direction of prognosis 
which is really not at all bad in many cases of simple thromb 
osis the patients often retaining some useful vision after the 
reestablishment of the circulation and the absorption of 
haemorrhages 
The occurrence of acute glaucoma as a sequel however 
renders the prognosis extremely grave since these cases 
owing to the condition of the vessels are such that an iridec 
tomy does not afford much promise of success 
My thanks are due to the honorary staff of the Birmingham 
and Midland Eye Hospital for permission to publish notes of 
these cases

REFLECTIONS ON OPHTHALMIC WORK IN 
THE ARMY 
By JOHN GRIMSHAW MDLond MRCSEng Etc 
Aldershot 
It is with pleasure that I read the annotation on spectacled 
soldiers which appeared in the British Medical Journal of 
September 21st 1901 A there are various points in it which 
have occupied my special att ention for a considerable time under 
favourable conditions for examining into and forming some 
opinions on this important question it may prove of interest 
if I describe briefly my experience and m a general way 
record a few impressions on the subject Of defective vision in 
soldiers as it has appealed to me 
For over eighteen months as civil surgeon attached to the 
Cambridge Hospital Aldershot I have had charge of the 
ophthalmic work of this hospital and as a part of my duties 
connected therewith it has fallen to my lot to examine and 
report upon for the medical officer in charge all cases of 
I defective vision reporting sick at this hospital This process 
i includes all cases sent to hospital from the various inspection 
rooms in South Camp for eye examination and report 
Further I reported on all soldiers admitted into the Cam 
bridge Hospital who were invalided home from South Africa 
on account of eye trouble of one kind or another This repre 
sents only a small portion of my ophthalmic work in hospital 
and camp but time does not allow me to deal with my entire 
ophthalmic experience here in anything like a comprehensive 
and exact manner 
After some time when I fell into the routine work of the 
military medical system I recognised the great importance of 
this subject of defective vision in its relation to voluntary 
enlistment and to the efficacy of the man as a fighting unit 
after enlistment For the last twelve months therefore I 
have kept complete copies of my reports and it has been my 
aim to make each report minutely and accurately represent 
the true state of the eye examined I worked out the refrac 
tion of each eye by retinoscopy after application of hom 
atropine cum cocaine and afterwards checked the results and 
the ability of the soldier to answer correctly by examination 
with test types and trial lenses All other methods of routine 
eye examination were used by me in every case so that I 
could conscientiously say on occasion 
 no cause for defec 
tive vision can be found 
It is only those perhaps who have like myself seen the 
wearying and nerveshattering effects of the 
 
scrimshankers 
importunity upon the responsible medical officer who can 
realise the value of this moral support when appealed to in 
the hour of trial 
 
Are you sure there is nothing wrong 
with this mans eyes Mr 
 
The amount of material I have had at my disposal can be 
 judged by the following extract  The work carried out by 
the RAMC at Aldershot since the war commenced has 
been enormous but it has been accomplished with remark 
able success Some idea of this can be gathered from the 
fact that during the year 1900 over iooco patients passed 
through the wards of the Cambridge Hospital alone and over 
3 000 of these were sick and wounded from South Africa 
1 find that in the last twelve months I have written some 
250 reports of the kind described on cases of defective vision 
for the medical officer in charge of the Cambridge Hospital 
These reports I may add are forwarded by this officer to the 
principal medical officer attached to the invaliding documents 
of those patients whom I have recommended for discharge on 
account of visual disabilities

Among nonrefractive or complicating morbid conditions 
were  i Leukoma common 2 Sequelae of old iritis com

with more or less occlusion of pupil posterior synechi asin 
cluding cases of total posterior synechiae with exclusion of 
pupil followed by softening and shrinking of globe and com 
plete loss of sight The majority of the latter iritic class and 
all the destruction of globe cases were in soldiers invalided 
home from South Africa 3 Cataracts rare 4 Vitreous 
opacities common 5 Fundus changes rare including 
optic neuritis several of which according to medical history 
sheet followed enteric in South Africa choroiditis and 
choroidal haemorrhages  ruptured choroid  detached retina 
including a remarkable case caused by lightning stroke a de 
scription of which was read by Major Yarr before the 
Ophthalmological Society 
I would here like to draw attention to the number of cases 
sent to me diagnosed conjunctivitis which were really 
cases of iritis and to the frequency with which I see sequelae 
of neglected cases of iritis in synechiae etc as above de 
scribed On several occasions I have just been in time to 
prevent dire consequences of mistaken diagnosis or in 
efficient treatment by frequent applications of atropine 
Moreover I have reason to believe that an error of refraction 
especially astigmatism and hypermetropia is liable to lead 
to a mistaken diagnosis of optic neuritis For example I will 
quote a case at present in my wards Sergt P invalided 
home from South Africa suffering from defective vision the 
result of optic neuritis following an attack of enteric medical 
history sheet Retinoscopy reveals simple myopic astigma 
tism in each eye but no signs of optic neuritis or other 
morbid change in fundus or elsewhere On examination with

To help me to avoid certain pitfalls of eye work on entering 
general practice I regularly carried a little box in my vest 
pocket containing discs of atropine for iritis cocaine for 
cornea foreign bodies etc eserine for glaucoma and 
homatropine c cocaine for retinoscopy and fundus examina 
tion To my box I have added fluorescin discs for corneal 
ulcers The benefits which have accrued to patient and self 
by the adoption of such aids to memory afford me sufficient 
excuse for mentioning my little device 
To all RAMC medical officers I would urge the invalu 
able help of retinoscopy in army ophthalmic work It is 
indispensable  nothing can replace it as an objective visual 
test easy of application 
I may say that many of the cases reporting sick were 
ordered to do so by their musketry instructor for defective 
vision revealed by bad shooting Trial by fire is a very 
excellent trial in more ways than one for the soldier and it 
serves better than any conventional rule of thumb visual 
tests to convert his latent defective vision into total manifest 
My cases prove either neglect of the medical examiner or 
his assistant to conform with War Office regulations or the 
inadequacy of the visual tests to serve as an effective barrier 
to the enlistment of recruits visually defective from ametropia 
or organic lesion Both causes operate in permitting a large 
number of men to enter the army who are unfit for it through 
visual defects whether of a nature to be corrected by glasses 
or not 
1 Is the medical examination of recruits unsatisfactory 
under the present system or at any rate inefficiently per 
formed The following cases of ametropia selected from 
amongst many in my list would seem to point to an answer in 
the affirmative

I have asked such men how they managed to pass the V 
tests and they have replied in the following fashion   
1 was 
never examined I tipped the recruiting sergeant I 
rushed through with the crowd  I guessed  them some 
how  I never did count the dots though examined 
Confronted with cases of the quality and quantity here re 
corded and by such explanatory statements made by men in 
the regular army I am able to sympathise with Lord 
Kitchener in his strictures passed upon the physical unfit 
ness of the Imperial Yeomanry and the troubles in which 
they involved him and his staff in South Africa 
With reference to the remark 
 
I tipped the recruiting 
sergeant I may state that the recruiting sergeant receives 
2S 6d for each recruit The addition of another 2S 6d as a 
dole from the anxious wouldbe Thos Atkins would surely 
make recruiting a lucrative and desirable form of occupation 
It will be seen therefore that it is to the recruiting 
sergeants advantage that the maximum number of his can 
didates be accepted by the medical examiner 
The tricks of the trade are well known and understood by 
the experienced officer For example the test dot card is 
held up before the candidate by the medical examiner whilst 
the assistant covers an eye It does not require a vivid 
imagination to understand the ease with which the number 
of dots can be conveyed by the assistant to the subject by a 
series of secret taps 
There are other tricks of legerdemain practised in the 
attempts to impose upon the examining surgeon which 
are worthy almost of a Maskelyne Even actual imperson 
ation of the proposed recruit is not unknown But 1 am 
afraid there is carelessness on the part of the medical exa 
miner of recruits and even criminal neglect on the part of 
him who rises superior to the testdot card and credulously 
asks the recruit 
 
Are you all right  
 
The present army sys 
tem must not be altogether exonerated from blame in the 
matter 
First in these days of recruiting difficulties it is to be 
feared that medical examiners believe that the quality of 
recruits must be subsidiary to quantity and that the adop 
tion of the principle of let em all come would be accept 
able to the recruiting authorities 
Secondly these responsible examinations as now arranged 
often fall upon civilian doctors or raw RAMC lieutenants 
who can scarcely be blamed for carrying their responsibility 
so lightly if through ignorance or inexperience they do not 
realise the immediate or farreaching results of carelessness 
of their recruiting actsa carelessness which will involve 
financial loss to the State by enforced discharge of semi 
trained men from the service and possibly disastrous losses 
on the field of action through imperfect shooting picketing 
or scouting 
The best way I think to prevent such unfortunate 
occurrences 
 
in the examination of recruits would be to ap 
point consultative Boards of experienced RAMC officers 
specially skilled in the detection of disqualifying disabilities 
to examine recruits before final admission into the ranks  
such a Board to have on eye matters at least an expert 
skilled by specialism in the visual disqualifications of 
recruits to whom all doubtful eye cases might be referred for 
report

WORK IN THE ARMY LmSS i3S 
Some such system would certainly have to be organised if 
the British Medical Journals suggestion of enlarging the 
meshes of the recruiting net were to be adopted for the 
ophthalmic expert would have to answer amongst other 
questions whether the fish caught were worth the curing  
But at this stage we are confronted with the question of 
specialism by officers of the RAMC a question large and 
important the discussion of which does not come within the 
range of these reflections I need only say that such 
specialism is not only very desirable but absolutely neces 
sary if the multitudinous duties of the RAMC officers are 
to be performed in anything like an efficient and satisfactory 
manner 
2 Are the visual tests sufficiently stringent  These V 
tests by means of the testdot card are as follows  
A recruit for the regular army must be able to count these 
dots at a distance oi 10 feet Each eye must be examined 
separately 
These tests would pass a recruit for the regular army with 
VTV and reject one as unfit with V below ft This means 
that a degree of 175 myopia each eye would be accepted 
For the militia volunteers and the departmental corps V 
acuity represented by testdot card held at 5 feet instead of 
10 feet is demanded Such a difference appears somewhat 
inconsistent when so many irregular troops are at present 
engaged on active service in South Africa 
It will be seen that the test will not exclude a hyper 
mtrope whose compensatory accommodation is unstable 
enough to break down by the least constitutional debility  
and as a matter of fact I have many records in my notes of  
 
I first noticed my eyes bad after enteric 
In consideration of this question it must be remembered 
that in shooting the eye has to be accommodated in rapid 
succession between the fore and back sights of the rifle and 
the target Even simple errors of refraction of 2 D to 3 D 
or 15 D will render this difficult 
This testdot card was introduced by Professor Longmore in 
i860 and was based by him on the work of German oculists 
No fresh edition of the test has been published by the War 
Office since 1870 when the then distance of 15 feet was re 
duced to 10 feet a modification which was demanded by the 
exigencies of recruiting The test is a rough and ready one 
and is very suitable for recruits who are unable to read It 
assumes that because a man can count dots at a distance of 
10 feet which I would note is a totally different thing from 
seeing them with any sharpness of definition he can see a 
bullseye 3 feet diameter at 600 yards with sufficient precision 
to enable him to shoot at it with reasonable chances of success 
And in this assumption there are surely possible fallacies 
From testdots to targets from 10 feet to 600 yards from 
counting dots to shooting bulls are surely distances to leap 
which resemble somewhat impassable gulfs For be it ob 
served soldiers do not in active warfare shoot at white bulls 
or blackgrounds  they shoot at men often only part of a man 
and at men also who may be indistinguishable in colour from 
the ground on which they stand or lie Moreover it is un 
doubtedly true that the use of guns of such long range and 
precision in modern warfare demand keener visual 
acuity 
in 
the soldier than was formerly the case Most of the shooting 
I am told in the Boer war has approximated closely to ranges 
of 1000 and 2000 yards and even accurate shooting at shorter 
ranges is vastly more important now than it used to be in the 
old days of the bayonet 
For Lord Roberts has said that the bayonet is an obsolete 
weapon of attack and has been replaced in modern warf are 
by rifle fire within a zone of 200 to 600 yards and that in 
future battles will c teris paribus be won by armies which 
possess the best and straightest shots at this distance From 
Sir Redvers Buller we get the opinion that superiority of the 
Boers over us in this wearisome South Africa campaign is 
largely because of his superior distant vision 
Everyone therefore must admit the desirability for each 
recruit of the regular army to have the raw material of visual 
acuity in him lor the making of an efficient fighting unit 
which par excellence means a firstclass shot and a sharp eyed 
scout These visual tests are insufficiently stringent to serve 
in barring men from entering the army who do not possess 
that excellent vision necessitated by these two allimportant 
functions of the modern efficient soldier and my experience 
goes to prove that men in the army are waking up to the im 
portance of good vision as seen by their anxiety to have de 
lects corrected by glasses or otherwise Officers have con 
sulted me respecting their eyesight preparatory to going 
through their course of musketry at flythe who have had 
errors of refraction as low as  
125 D and  
15 D myopia 
A few days ago Lieutenant P RHA consulted me about 
his eyes He had recently returned from South Africa and 
when there his attention was drawn to his defective distant 
vision and the need for its correction Correction after 
retinoscopy gave

Sergeant P case previously recorded who has been a first 
class shot and instructor of musketry is anxious to remain 
in the army but is greatly concerned about his defective 
distant vision Yet examination and correction shows only  
1D axis vert 1    without correction V  rV 
Private X HLI one of the crack shots firing for his 
company at Bisley this year consulted me for epiphora some 
weeks before the competition He said that the watering of 
his eyes affected his shooting I was able by operation to 
relieve his epiphora and to make his shooting more satisfac 
tory to him 
All these cases could count their dots at 10 feet with 
ease 
Telescopic sights are now used by the artillery and recently 
efforts have been made to perfect rifle fire by some such aid 
All guns small and large are made to fire with maximum 
accuracy at all ranges  yet correct shooting is still dependent 
upon good vision and but little attention is paid to this sub 
ject It still seems as if the question of whether a man is of 
certain height or chest measurement or whether he has vari 
cose veins overshadows the most important question of all 
Can he see well  
By way of digression I may state that it is somewhat 
astonishing and perplexing to learn from soldiers who have 
returned from the front the frequency with which kopjes 
were targets and not Boers Fighting all day Sir and 
never saw a Boer 
 
Yes Sir we simply blazed away at the 
hills on the chance of hitting a Boer or two Such remarks 
as these I have often heard from our invalided South Africans 
and they have compelled one to ask oneself the question 
whether in these days of smokeless powder and in the clear 
atmosphere of the veldt the eyes of our absentminded 
beggar 
 
were not a little to blame in his failure to spot the 
Boer although cunningly entrenched 
Everyone also will I presume admit the necessity for the 
prompt discharge from the army of the man who through 
ametropia if this must remain uncorrected or organic lesion 
has ceased to be an efficient soldier Unfortunately these 
visual tests cut both ways in their application for 
 
whatever 
visual disorder a NCO or soldier serving in the ranks may 
happen to contract so long as he is left with acuteness of 
vision equal to that for which recruits are tested he must be 
regarded as visually qualified for military duties Moreover 
as will be seen later the test imposed upon men who have 
suffered impairment of vision of one eye is more stringent in 
case of discharge than on entrance It follows therefore that 
if the visual tests are ineffective in barring men with unsuitable 
vision they will serve even in a greater degree to keep such 
undesirables in the army unless spectacles are allowed to 
correct the ametropes and the men are willing to wear them 


136 mpwoSaJ  OPHTHALMIC WORK IN THE 
ARMYJan 
ig 1902 
The advice given in my report to the Invaliding Board 
respecting discharge of soldiers has not always perhaps co 
incided with the regulation visual requirements and when 
there has been a proved discrepancy between them I cannot 
blame the able and responsible President of the Board if thus 
placed between the 
 
devil 
 
of the dots and the 
 
deep sea of 
my report he has felt bound when evidence could be gained 
to rely on the regulation standard of efficiency 
Some 80 cases I find of defective vision through ametropia 
have been invalided from the Cambridge Hospital alone dur 
ing the last twelve months Ophthalmic surgeons may be 
interested in comparing these figures with the 136 cases I have 
recorded 
A reference to the figures given will remind the reader of 
these remarks that in many of my refraction cases the error 
was more marked in one eye than the other  similarly also 
incases of organic lesion One of the questions I have fre 
quently had to answer is Should this man shoot from his 
left shoulder For impaired visual piwer or total loss of 
vision of one eye if the other eye be efficient is not held to 
be a cause of unfitness for further military service and under 
musketry rgulations permission is granted under medical 
certificate to fire from the left shoulder I may say I have 
no  faith in the left or oneeyed soldier I have invariably 
found him a dissatisfied nuisance as well as an inefficient 
soldier with a perfect mania for reporting sick Such one 
eyed men are attracted by a hospital like a moth by a bright 
light I know one such soldier with one eye excised who 
much to his disgust had failed to get his discharge For 
months subsequently his life was spent in taproom guard 
room prison or hospital uutil finally he was sent to me from 
our restraint ward where he had been detained for delirium 
tremens for a report on his solitary eye He got his report 
and his discharge And in certain walks of the armyI 
should really say rides for I specially refer to drivers and 
artillery or cavalry menI willingly recommend such for die 
 charge as in my opinion binocular vision is essential for the 
safe performance of their duties

was a oneeyed astigmatic myope Driver G ASC left eye

I did not ask this soldier whether he could count dots or 
not 
For over twelve months I have made a point of embodying 
in my report the results of my attempted correction of errors 
of refraction and of stating whether spectacles would 
remedy the defect and convert the man once more into an 
efficient soldier I purposely use the words attempted 
correction and this must be read in connection with my 
previous remark and the ability of the soldier to answer 
correctly For the 
 
scrimshanker 
 
is somewhat of a curio 
He is apt to view the case of trial lenses with grave suspicion 
and all the lenses in creation will not increase his manifest 
vision beyond  if he thinks himself threatened by the snares 
of the designing medical officer A small residuum of my 
cases were undoubtedly 
 
scrimshankers but a majority of 
those with causes for defective vision I believe exaggerated 
their defect in order to get their discharge 
This statement may astonish the civilian reader but it 
will not perturb the army medical He knows full well the 
unpopularity of the army and the avidity with which a 
worried Tommy seizes the slightest pretext upon which to 
base a claim for his 
 
ticketofleave My experience is that 
all the kings glasses and all the kings men will not make an 
obstinate 
 
Tommy see well again under existing conditions 
of service and faced by the wide 
 
open door 
 
of exit  Vide 
my suggestions at conclusion 
All the South African invalids I glassed were anxious for 
their discharge and it was interesting to note with what 
altered V acuity the majority of these men faced Snellens 
tyoes after the magic letters P I proposed invalid had been 
written on their sheets 
Among my South African invalids was a Cambridge 
University undergraduate who had enlisted in the evil 
days of adversity and desired his discharge when the 
clouds had rolled away He had apparently no cause for de 
fective vision excepting f i D hypermetropia Visual acuity 
was represented by T I discharged him from hospital as a 
malingerer but he was at once returned on my hands  so  
pras tempted to enter into an unholy compact with the 
 
Evil 
One and to promise him his discharge if before leaving hos 
pital he would tell me the truth The result was agreeable to 
me Vf and likewise to him namely discharge by the In 
validing Board Be it not understood by my professional 
brethren that 1 spun a yarn worthy of the hero of The Tadpole 
of an Archangel  no I simply quoted the report of an oph 
thalmic surgeon consulted by my friend with evil intent 
when on sick furlough following his return from South Africa 
who had diagnosed hyperaesthesia of the retina and had 
ordered large blue goggles of the strengthfo75 D In my 
glassing operations and inmy attempts to place these army 
optical matters on a somewhat different footing I have in 
variably had the hearty support and sympathetic cooperation 
of the medical officer in charge of the Cambridge Hospital Up 
to date we have secured from the War Office the payment for 
spectacles of South African ametropes invalided on account 
of defective vision At present however men remaining in 
the service must buy their own glasses But any day lam ex 
pecting as a result of further application to have this arrange 
ment altered and Tommy I feel sure will welcome his gift of 
spectacles with eyes wider open than they now are 
The use of spectacles by soldiers in the ranks is not sanc 
tioned or prohibited by any published regulation in the 
army Each case must be decided on its own merits by the 
commanding officer and so far as I have been able to ascer 
tain by him alone and to this officer my ophthalmic report 
respecting the use of glasses in suitable cases has therefoie 
been forwarded by the medical officer in charge for his in 
spection and report 
My experience is that the commanding officers decision 
whether the man will be retained though spectacled will be 
governed largely by commonsense considerations 
 
Is the 
man anxious to remain in the service What are hi 
duties  
 
Is he worth keeping  
 
Can I rely upon that 
man on picket or sentrygo  
 Will a pair of broken or lost 
glasses possibly involve me in a regrettable incident when 
on active service  
 
There doubtless does exist in our army a strong prejudice 
against spectacled soldiers and this prejudice it must be 
admitted is under present conditions or service but a reason 
able one Some objections of course that can be raised 
against soldiers in the regular army wearing glasses are these 
The want of present means of replacing them when 
injured or broken in many stations where English 
troops are employed These difficulties would prove 
almost insuperable when on active service out of Europe 
The interference with their utility by dust rain etc specially 
felt by mounted troopers But these objections to spectacles 
may easily be exaggerated A largtd number of irregulars 
engaged in South Africa wear spectacles and I am told by 
returned soldiers that these men are extremely careful 0 
their glasses realising that their lives perhaps depend on 
them 
That glasses do not prevent a man becoming a good shot 
likewise the prevalence of their need amongst men for shoot 
ing is seen in the fact that some 25 per cent of our crack 
marksmen at Bisley wear spectacles At present in ouc 
regular army the regulations regarding musketry instruction 
provide that shortsighted men may when firing wear 
glasses but no soldier is allowed to wear spectacles on 
parade without the official consent of his commanding officer 
Only this last week the following case was sent to me for 
examination and report Gunner S RH A failed to count 
dots on reexamination before being drafted to India

I recommended that he be allowed to remain in the service 
and to wear spectacles regularly The man bore a good 
character and was anxious to proceed to India under these 
conditions the commanding officer without hesitation con 
sented to the mans wearing glasses and to his despatch to 
India 
My experience has led me to believe that there are a large 
number of ametropes in the army who ought to be 
 
glassed

and are not but who would gladly avail themselves of 
artificial visual aid if they knew that Lieutenant A or 
Captain B was sufficiently a doctor to know how to 
examine their eyes and if the War Office were willing to pay 
for the spectacles 
Army authorities are at present faced by two sets of diffi 
culties i Greater demand for good vision in our men by 
modern conditions of warfare  2 the old old recruiting 
difficulties which I have stated led in 1870 to the visual tests 
being lowered These difficulties will probably be overcome 
by a compromise 
Though unlearned in English or Continental literature on 
these important subjects I venture to make the following 
suggestions  
1 Do not admit more ametropes by still further lowering 
visual tests unless prepared to correct their vision 
2 The examination of such ametropes by ophthalmic 
experts civilian or military and their vision and correction 
to be recorded on their medical history sheets Such action 
would be necessary not 
only 
to treat the 
 
scrimshanking and 
discharge 
 
stages of a soldiers folie circulaire but to render 
easy the replacement of broken or lost glasses 
3 Opticians to be officially appointed whose duty it would 
be to keep an exact record of glasses supplied to check the 
regimental data 
4 The distribution of recruits according to their sight to 
branches of service not necessitating keen vision or other 
wise If the visual tests were lowered it would be of paramount 
importance to separate the hewers of wood and drawers of 
water from the soldier who proposes to become a good rifle 
man cavalry man or artillerist 
5 To support discipline and to lessen the responsibility of 
medical officers by inflicting summary punishmentby court 
martial and under the certificate of the ophthalmic 
surgeonon soldiers afflicted with folie circulaire of above 
type 
6 To encourage the correction of ametropia by granting 
spectacles to soldiers free of cost I never could understand 
why free spectacles were given to South African invalids con 
ditional on their discharge from the army I should have 
thought that a nondischarge was a more rational condition 
The War Office grant artificial teeth to men who are likely to 
become efficient soldiers and who are willing to remain in the 
army Why not spectacles  
7 Official encouragement to RAMC officers to specially 
qualify themselves in ophthalmic work such special qualifi 
cation to be rewarded with corresponding increase of pay 
8 The appointment of civilian consultants in certain mili 
tary centres or districts to cooperate witn the RAMC 
officers as occasion demanded or rendered desirable 
9 Special arrangements to be made whereby spectacles lost 
or broken can be replaced and for ensuring suitable glasses 
being always available on occasions of need This applies 
specially to men abroad or on active service 
Respecting the recent proposals made for reform of 
RAMC my remarks on specialism by medical officers 
of this corps were written before publication of these pro 
posals I have long advocated this and a closer union of the 
civil and military branches of our profession Twelve months 
ago a special department of the ear nose and throat was 
established at my request at the Cambridge Hospital I have 
charge of this and am taking notes for publication of 
 
reflections

AMBULATORY TREATMENT OF A RUPTURED 
TENDO ACHILLIS 
By J LYNN THOMAS CB FRCS 
Sureeon to the Cardiff Infirmary etc  late Senior Surgeon to the 
Welsh Hospital in South Africa 
A Personal Reminiscence of the South African 
Campaign 
Whilst proceeding to South Africa in advance of the Welsh 
Hospital on board the RMS Tantallon Castle I had the 
misfortune to rupture my right tend o Achillis on March 14th 
Read before the South Wales and Monmouthshire Branch of the 
British Medical Association at Merthyr Tydfil 
1900 when hopping on tiptoe during physical drill before 
breakfast y a wise provisionunappreciated by the 
writer until his accidentthe hopping stage of the drill 
is not reached until an amount of strength is used upr 
which prevents one doing the hop after the fashion of a 
premire danseuse Unfortunately for me I got on deck 
when the hopping stage of the drill had been reached and 
I joined in fresh and vigorous when at the first turn round 
the deck the breaking strain of the tendon was reached with 
unexpected suddenness which rendered the foot utterly 
helpless I felt my heel drop on the boards accompanied 
by a loud sound like the snarj of a broken cello string and 
followed by a sudden dull pain and a disagreeable warmthr 
near the heel Whether the sound was conveyed through the 
bones the air or both I cannot decide but the sound was to 
me very loud indeed On examination there was the usualr 
I deep gap admitting easily the ball of my thumb which is 
seen after tenotomy of the tendo Achillis 
The steward brought me a bucketful of seawaterthe 
travellers panacea for strains and sprainsinto which I 
plunged my maimed limb while I experienced a melancholy 
awakening of the surgical traditions of treatment of similar 
lesions The first picture which greatly worried me was that 
of the stereotyped extended foot in a slipper with pointed toe 
and a heelstrap attached to a collar fixed to the thigh above 
the bent knee it presents itself in surgical textbooks of 
many countries with a nersistence that for the moment 
quite haunted me for being a civilian surgeon en route to 
a great war where plantigrade progression would probably 
be a necessity I concluded that such treatment was funda 
mentally wrong The next and more modern picture was 
that of a leg and foot in plasterofparis with its owner 
using a pair of walkingsticks which would effectually doom 
him to a rest in Capetown this method of treatment was 
also unacceptable to me  whilst the last picture of all was 
introduced to me by a brother surgeon on board in the upto 
date fashion   
Let me cut down and tie the ends together  
it is the very best possible method I must confess I did 
not fully appreciate the value of the advice for I immedietely 
thought of all sorts of possible pyogenic tragedies 
I decided very soon to lay aside the usual methods of treat 
ment my guiding principle being che va piano va sano che va 
sano va lentano The treatment I adopted until I arrived in 
Capetown was massage of the leg night and morning and the 
application of coldwater bandages I managed to hobble 
along fairly well by rotating outwards the whole of my lower 
limb and using my adductors to advance the foot By this 
method one can with care use the foot as an inanimate prop 
without extending or flexing the anklejoint After arriving 
in Capetown and trying a variety of splints for restraining 
ankle movements I hit upon the splint which is represented 
in the diagram and which I got from Mayer and Meltzers

local branch It is an aluminium spatula moulded to the 
shape of the bend of the ankle  it was pushed into a very 
thick indiarubber tubing which acted not only as padding 
but also kept the splint in its place by preventing the 
aluminium moving downwards under the boot lace It is 
necessary for the comfort of the patient to carry out the 
details illustrated in the diagram one of these being that the 
boot lace should be placed right round the lower part of the
