DR JAMESON CB wSi 281 
Operation had followed occupations necessitating much mus 
cular effort 
Rhinoplasty 
AssistantSurgeon I M Shah LM since 1885 had per 
formed 228 rhinopla8tic operations In 224 of these cases 
the nose had been criminally mutilated this form of injury 
from malice jealousy and revenge being peculiar to Ori 
entals  women are the usual victims A full description 
was given of the different forms of this injury and of the 
operative measures applied to each The Indian or forehead 
flap method was held to be by far the best way of repairing a 
nose The chief objection to this method is the permanent 
and unsightly scar on the forehead This however in India 
is readily screened by some headdress or by a mark of red 
gum worn as a religious observance on the forehead The 
Tagliacotian or Italian method was discarded as being irk 
some to the patient and unsatisfactory in its results The 
nasal method or repairing the nose from the nasal tissues 
is applicable in a limited number of cases as when the loss 
is small and confined only to the tip and adjacent bridge of 
the nose the septum and columna being almost entire The 
cheekflap operation is necessitated when the defect of nose 
is unilateral that is when one alar portion is wanting or 
when there is some obstacle in forming a foreheadflap 
Intralaryngeal Tumour 
SurgeonMajor J Smyth MD related the following case 
A Brahmin youth aged 18 years who had been almost voice 
less for about a year presented when examined with the 
laryngoscope by the author a firmlooking lobulated pale 
red tumour about the size of the last phalanx between the 
vocal cords having its origin apparently from the base of 
the epiglottis below the anterior insertion of the vocal cords 
This growth was removed by a wire craseur so made that the 
wire when drawn home retreated quite within the tube and 
fitted it so closely that any tissue in its grasp was sure to be 
out clean through About half the tumour was removed at 
the first operation and the remaining portion after an interval 
of three weeks The patient was quite well when last seen 
about two years later There were then no signs of recur 
rence and the voice though a little hoarse in the morning 
was usually quite clear 
Some Difficult Cases of Chloroform Administration 
Surgeon Arthur Neve FRCSEdin pointed out that for 
all practical purposes ether is not available as an anaesthetic 
in India This fact should enable the profession there to re 
gard the chloroform controversy without bias It is not reason 
able in his opinion to declare that because chloroform is 
the only available general anaesthetic in India it is therefore 
the best in a cool climate Although since 1875 there have 
been upwards of 6000 administrations of chloroform without 
a single direct or indirect death in the Kashmir Mission 
Hospital not a year passed without instances of dangerous 
symptoms due to one or other of the following causes  1 
Primary syncope from fear  2 laryngeal spasm  3 second 
ary syncope from shock due to insufficient chloroform and 
also from a proper dose acting on nonoxygenated nerve 
centres  4 tertiary sometimes secondary syncope con 
nected with vomiting 5 apncea from a mechanical 
causes b spasm of the larynx c the toxic action of an 
overdose relative or absolute on the nervous centres 
Fabricated Wounds and Injuries 
Akbar Khan IMS dealing with this subject said 
injuries were not infrequently fabricated in India for 
the purpose of simulating an assault in support of 
a false charge or to avert suspicion These injuries 
are made by different weapons in different ways but 
are usually incised wounds Contused fabricated wounds 
are very rare The selfinflicted incised wounds are 
in most instances slight and often consist in a series of small 
superficial cuts They are never found on vital parts and 
are generally directed from below upwards in the lower part 
of the body and from above downwards in the upper part 
Attempts are sometimes made to simulate ecchymosis by 
applying to the skin the juice of marking nuts or chitta 
Such applications however usually produce blistering or a 
vesicular eruption easily distinguished from ecchymosis The 
author notwithstanding a long and careful study of this 
subject finds it very puzzling and trying to distinguish a 
fabricated wound from a genuine one and holds that extreme 
caution is necessary in giving a decided opinion in a court of 
justice on this intricate matter 
The Varieties and Differential Diagnosis of Primary 
Venereal Sores 
SurgeonMajor J Carter Battebsby AMS discarding 
altogether the nomenclature hard and soft as erroneous 
and misleading would divide all primary venereal sores into 
three classesone of syphilitic sores the second of non 
syphilitic and the third of mixed or doubtful in which the 
ulcer appears first as a nonsyphilitic venereal or socalled 
 
soft sore and after a time develops the characteristics of a 
true syphilitic lesion The class of syphilitic sores includes 
besides the hard Hunterian chancre a single circular sac 
about the size of a sixpence which is soft from the beginning 
and throughout its entire course The mixed sore which 
begins as an ordinary nonsyphilitic venereal ulcer and 
finally becomes indurated and followed by secondary sym 
ptoms is due in the authors opinion to the existence of a 
double poison manifesting itself in the one individual con 
tracted probably at the same time or it may be at different 
periods  
DR JAMESON CB 
On January 24th Dr L S Jameson CB Administrator of 
Mashonaland and Matabeleland was entertained at dinner 
at the Htel Mtropole London by his contemporaries at 
University College including the medical and surgical staff 
of the hospital at that time The chair was taken by Mr 
Christopher Heath at present the Senior Surgeon to the 
hospital and among those present Wfre Sir J Russell 
Reynolds Sir John Erichsen Sir John Williams Dr Bastian 
Dr Gowers Dr Coupland Mr A J Pepper Mr Barker Sir 
J R Andrew Clark AMS and others to the number alto 
gether of over 100 
The Chairman having given the toast of The Queen 
which was duly honoured proceeded to propose the health 
of the guest of the evening He said that the meeting was 
one of old friends called together to congratulate Dr Jameson 
on his achievements in South Africa He was not indeed 
the first medical man who had distinguished himself as an 
explorer and leader of men for on the same continent Dr 
Livingstone had preceded him and in the Arctic regions 
Dr Rae had made important discoveries while in the sphere 
of pure diplomacy the name of Sir Rutherford Alcock now 
the senior Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons would 
be remembered Dr Jamesons life in Africa for the first ten 
years had been that of a successful medical practitioner and 
the estimation in which he was held in that capacity was 
proved by the fact that the Free State Parliament passed a 
special resolution in order to secure his professional attend 
ance on Sir Henry Brand probably a unique piece of legisla 
tion In 1888 he gave up medical practice and went to Bulu 
wayo where he carried out the difficult and delicate negotia 
tions with Lobengula for the cession of Mashonaland with 
complete success Later on at the time of the Boer Trek 
when there was undoubtedly an intention to force a passage 
into the Chartered Companys territory Dr Jameson by his 
tact and powers of conciliation succeeded in averting a con 
flict He again gave splendid proof of his capacity for organ 
isation during the preparations for the conduct of the late 
Matabele war Though the whole responsibility of the 
expedition rested on his shoulders he found time to visit the 
wounded and to take part in the performance of certain 
operations 
The toast was drunk with enthusiasm 
Dr Jameson in reply after referring to the gratification 
which he felt by the presence of so many of his fellow 
students and his old teachers said that he had rather driftf d 
out of the profession than deliberately left it In fact it 
would be truer to say that the duties of the doctor had 
become merged in those of the administrator He recognised 
the debt which he owed to the training received while the 
occupant of various resident posts in University College 
Hospital Especially during the last two years of his time

there when he occupied the position of resident medical 
officer had he learnt what he considered to be the main 
elements of success for anyone who attempted to govern or 
administer  first never to make any promise the fulfilment 
of which could not be ensured  secondly to believe that 
ones own opinion was not the only opinion worth 
considering but to listen to that of others If 
those two principles were recognised and acted up to 
it would be good for those who were governed for the man 
who governed and for those to whom he was responsible 
After recalling some reminiscences of the time when he was 
dresser under Mr Buckston Browne as housesurgeon to 
Sir John Erichsen house physician to Sir Russell Reynolds 
and the successful competitor of Mr Pepper for the office of 
housesurgeon under the late Mr Marshall he referred to his 
recent experiences in Matabeleland 
 
Whatever the country 
might think he said of the methods of our procedure in 
Matabeleland I am anxious that the members of the pro 
fession to which I have the honour to belong should under 
stand what took place I myself previous to our troubles 
last year always hoped that the Matabele question would be 
settled without having recourse to force I knew that Loben 
gula had always said that he would never fight with the 
4 
white man and I believed that he had absolute control over 
his people I therefore believed that we should come through 
all our difficulties without any conflict I was egotistical 
enough to think that had 1 been at Pretoria when the 
trouble began I should have been able to stave off any 
conflict But I was two hundred miles away and I will give 
you as short an account as I can of what happened When I 
arrived I found on both sides of the road the Matabeles 
carrying off their goods in preparation for a fight But the 
year before the same thing had happened and I then took up 
a firm position and settled matters I thought I might do 
the same thing again It turned out I was wrong As I 
went up to Victoria and saw the kraals burning in every 
direction I knew that only two things were possible  either we 
must abandon two thousand people who would certainly have 
lost their all including every white man and there would have 
been such a butchering of Mashonas as had never been heard 
of before  or we must use forcewe must go to Buluwayo 
When the war was over after the settlement I went 
over the whole facts and I heard the same account 
from everyone I found I was right in regard to the 
king He never wanted to fight but I was wrong with 
regard to the nation The head men had entirely the upper 
hand of the king There were only two people who did not 
want to fightLobengula himself and one of the Indunas 
who had paid a visit to England So I wish you to know to 
night that we adopted the only possible method we could 
adopt We were driven into the country During the three 
preceding years we had done everything we possibly could 
to avoid such a thing as a conflict No one could be more 
ready than I am to condemn any attempt to bring on a war 
with these unfortunate races 
The health of the Secretaries Dr Radcliffe Crocker 
and Mr Quarry Silcock was given by Dr Poore and ac 
knowledged by those gentlemen 
MEDICAL SICKNESS ANNUITY AND LIFE 
ASSURANCE FRIENDLY SOCIETY 
The usual quarterly meeting of the Executive and General 
Committee of this Society was held at 429 Strand on January 
16th at 5 oclock 
There were present the Chairman Dr de Havilland Hall

progress during the twelve months The number of effective 
members had increased from 1386 to 1528 and the funds 
have largely grown in all three branches of the business A 
sum of 5000 has been paid from the Sickness Fund as a 
bonus to the members in that branch but notwithstanding 
this heavy draft upon it the Sickness Fund has increased 
from 33903 14s 8d to 35160 3s 4d The total net result of 
the years working is an increase of the funds from 
71323 3s 3d to 78743 3s 5d 
The Society is now a subscriber to the Royal Medical Bene 
volent College and the votes thus obtained will be used to 
assist members of the Society or their relatives who may be 
seeking to obtain the benefits of the College At present 
only one such candidate is known namely the son of a mem 
ber who was accidentally killed in May last but full discre 
tion is left with the Chairman Dr de Havilland Hall to help 
any other eligible candidate being a member or relative of a 
member of the Society and the Secretary will be glad to 
near of any such case

DEATHS UNDER ANESTHETICS 
ACE Mixture 
From a report which has been placed at our disposal we 
learn that the patient who died under an anaesthetic at the 
Middlesex Hospital on January 3rd was a very muscular 
man but fat and of alcoholic habits He had been admitted 
on the previous evening for the removal of suppurating 
glands in the neck The anaesthetic which was freshly 
prepared ACE mixture was administered on an ordinary 
fiannel inhaler The patient struggled most violently and 
had to be restrained After a litt Je chloroform had been 
sprinkled on the inhaler the struggling subsided The 
ACE mixture was then resumed After about two minutes 
the muscular rigidity became less marked A little later the 
breathing became shallow and the pupils which had been 
contracted began to dilate The anaesthetic was discon 
tinued but the face became paler and the radial pulse coulo 
not be felt Finally respiration stopped the face later be 
coming very cyanosed The operation had not been com 
menced and the anaesthetic had not been given more than 
five minutes The head was immediately lowered and artifi 
cial respiration started Hypodermic injections of ether and 
enemata of brandy were given  hot applications were made 
to the chest and amyl nitrite held to the nostrils but no 
signs of animation appeared Artificial respiration was dis 
continued after an hour At the postmortem examination 
the right ventricle was found to be very dilated and there was 
marked fatty infiltration of its wall The left ventricle was 
also dilated and its wall had undergone some fibrosis The 
lungs were emphysematous and these organs together with 
the kidneys brain and spleen were markedly congested 
LITERARY NOTES 
We understand that a work entitled The Insane and The Latv 
ia now in the press and will shortly be issued It is from the 
pen of Mr Pitt Lewis QC who it will be remembered took 
an active part in the discussion on  
Criminal Responsibility 
of the Insane 
 
at the annual mf eting of the British Medical 
Association at Bristol 1894 He has had the advantage of 
the cooperation of Dr Percy Smith Medical Superintendent 
of Bethlem Royal Hospital and of Mr J A Hawke 
Barri8teratLaw and Fellow of St Johns College Oxford 
The book will deal with  1 Detention and Treatment  
2 Maintenance  3 Responsibility both Civil and Criminal  
and 4 Capacity including that a as a witness b to make a 
will The subjects will be treated in a way to make the book

will contain a table of cases giving legal references to all the 
reports in which the cases may be found 
The first volume of the eighth German edition of Zieglers 
wellknown Textbook of Pathological Anatomy has appeared 
It consists of the portion on general pathology and forms a
