Many attempts have been made to enact laws of a similar 
kind in this country It would be vain repetition to do more 
than mention facts so familiar and recent to all of us The 
latest Midwives Bill of 
1899 is a case in point Based upon 
its immediate predecessor it had the advantage of the General 
Medical Councils recommendations  it provided that no 
woman shall call herself or 
habitually practise for gain as a 
midwife unless she has obtained a licence  that in order to 
be licensed she must produce evidence of having undergone a 
proper training and subsequent examination or at the time 
of passing the Bill been in bonMe practice as a midwife 
The Bill did not render it illegal for any person to render 
assistance to a lyingin woman in an emergency Many 
thorny details were associated with this Bill  it bristled with 
difficulties which it is unnecessary now to recall or to recapitu 
late Amendments were proposed by the General Medical 
Council the British Medical Association by numerous 
Branches Societies and individuals It was altered in the 
Standing Committee of the House of Commons it was 
pricked mutilated distorted until at length it became 
almost unrecognisable from its original form  finally it came 
to an ignoble end being talked out in the House done to death 
by its own promoters and wellintentioned friends 
I have shown that midwives have existed since the begin 
ning of the world  that they will continue as long as the 
human race lasts is equally oertain Alter their names if 
you wish or can  call them midwifery nurses or any other 
appellation you can suggest license them register them 
restrict them penalise 
them as much as you will but above 
all be fair to them  do not goad them to resistance  allow 
them educate and instruct them for the good of the race and 
the honour of the profession 
I venture to predict that the time will come when the  
Government of the day will have to take up the subject and  
propound 
a Midwives Bill The voice of public opinion will 
be behind it 
 
Great is Diana of the Ephesians  
 
will then 
be a useless cry The tide will sweep forwards  it will be 
ours to ride upon the crest of the wave if we so will  but it 
will also be open to us to attempt to stem its force and to 
find too late that the power was irresistible 
AN ADDRESS 
ON 
MILITARY SURGERY OF THE TIME OF 
AMBROISE PARE AND THAT OF THE 
PRESENT TIME 
Delivered before the East York and North Lincoln Branch of the 
British Medical Association 
By C H MILBURN MB MS 
President of the Branch  Surgeon to the Victoria Hospital Hull 
My iirst duty is to express to you my sense of the honour you 
have conferred on me by electing me to the important posi 
tion of President of this Branch I can assure you that I ap 
preciate the compliment highly and I trust as the first Pre 
sident in the new century that I shall with your assistance 
and 
support be able to hand on the office to my 
successor with 
no tarnish on the lustre with which I receive it from my im 
mediate predecessors 
In the annual presidential addresses with which your souls 
are vexed but to which you listen with a patience and 
courtesy worthy of a better cause it is 
usually 
tue fashion to 
review either the whole or by less ambitious men some 
special 
division of the science of medicine and to point out 
the progress made and the lessons taught during and by that 
rogress 
I do not wish in this case to be outside the 
ashion and therefore as a subject which during the last 
eighteen months has occupied our thoughts more or less 1 
have chosen as the basis of a short address The Military Sur 
gery of the Time of Ambroise Par and that of the Present 
Time 
I wish therefore today briefly to emphasise the fact of 
progress in medicine because we sometimes fail to recognise 
that we live in a time when knowledge is far advanced 
beyond that of even a few years ago  and because we have 
all that advanced knowledge we are disposed to pity those 
who had the misfortune to live in thosepast years  and all 
the more if they lived centuries ago We think they knew 
nothing and their work is therefore only worthy of our 
contempt  or at any rate they can have our sympathy for 
their ignorance We give them no credit for the work which 
has made our progress possible And yet if we read old 
treatises or books on such subjects as those in which progress 
is possibleand in this case on surgerywe often find that 
practices were in vogue then which we think are new and 
known only to a favoured few of us  that theories were 
invented and squabbled over to account for results the causes 
of which are unsettled even to this day  that reasons were 
given then to 
explain 
facts which are not yet explained and 
which are theorised over as dogmatically now as then For 
instance we find that observations were made of facts in con 
nection with wounds which were explained on certain theories 
then 
but which we explain in an entirely different way now 
and just as much to our satisfaction Who can say that 
 we 
have reached finality and that someone years hence may not 
be able to explain facts in a different way and also to hi 
complete ana finite satisfaction On this point Sir W 
Mac Cormac at the dinner when he received the Honorary 
Freedom of the Barbers Company 
on March 26th said  
It is interesting to note that Par when he was 65 years old dedicated 
in 157s his great work on surgery to the King and he there tells us that 
he had laboured forty years to bring his art to perfection and striven 
so hard to attain his end that the ancients have nought wherein to exce 
us and posterity will not be able to surpass us 
It is extraordinary that this boast of attained perfection made more 
I than 300 years ago remained largely true until the latter half of the 
nineteentn century witnessed the transformation of surgery This boast 
of perfection has been made with curious frequency by surgeons The 
celebrated French surgeon Baron Boyer who was also at one time a 
barbersurgeon says in the preface to his great work on surgery in 1814 
1 that surgery had made the greatest progress and had arrived at the 
highest degree of perfection of which it was susceptible Sir John 
Erichsen and others have in their time said much the same thing 
Some years ago an English translation of this book by 
Ambroise Par came into my possession and in a desultory 
way I have occasionally looked through it and been amused 
at his phraseology and the quaintness of his illustrations or 
effigies as he calls them Being interested in military 
surgery I have read his chapters on gunshot wounds and 
found much that was suggestive Though his pathology is 
of course obsolete his histories of his cases are good  and L 
have thought it might be useful to 
briefly 
recite some of them 
with their treatment and then see what advance we can 
claim in the treatment of battle wounds as shown by a few 
reports of some of the cases so far recorded from the Boer 
war 
Before doing so it might however be worth while going 
over very shortly a few facts in connection with Ambroise Fares 
life By so 
doing 
we shall be better able to judge of the 
opportunities which he had to practise military surgery and 
so get our foundation on which to build the superstructure 
which shows the claims he had to be called the 
 
Father of 
 Modern Surgery  and incidentally to learn on what is the 
best authority how military surgery was carried on in the 
sixteenth century 
Quoting from an article in the Medical Review of April this 
year I find that Ambroise Par was at one time a barbers 
apprentice who arrived in Paris in 1532 and set about being 
initiated into the mysteries of shaving hairdreesing and 
poulticing Becoming a master of his trade in 1536 he 
opened shop under the barbersurgeons sign of the three 
basins In the intervals of his trade he probably studied at 
the hospitals and during the wars of Francis I he gained 
that knowledge of wounds and fractures which renders him 
the Father of Modern Surgery nevertheless it was as a 
barber that he started life As such he was illiteratethat 
is without Latinityand we find him deploring in the dedica 
tion of one of his books that 
it hath not pleased God so much grace to grant me that in youth I 
should have been based in Greek and Latin 
It was only by 
 a discreet process of dissimulation and a 
grave infraction of rules that Par received his cap and 
degree from the French College of Surgeons of that day He 
was attached to the persons of successive kings and was one 
of the few intimates of Charles IX whom that monarch was 
able to save from the horrors of the St Bartholomew 
Massacre Charles IXs successor Henry III so valued Par 
that through him the whole body of surgeons came into favour

Francis I had created a Faculty of Surgery in 1544 with privi 1 
leges not inferior to those of the University of Paris His 1 
decree was renewed by Henry III who further gave the sur i 
geons permission to open a course of public lectures This  
will give some idea of the important part Par played in the 1 
development of the recognition of the value of the surgeonB art  
It also shows that during the troublous and warring times of 1 
Francis I Henry II Francis II and Charles IX he would 1 
have such opportunities as fall to the lot of few surgeons of  
seeing and treating wounds received in war  
As an example of the surgical treatment of those days I 
quote the following case from Pars book   
Whilst I was a surgeon to the Marshal of Montejan at Turin a certain 
common souldier received a wound on his wrist with a musk et ball by 
which the bones and tendons being much broken and the nervous bodies 
cruelly torn there followed agangrene and at length a mortification 
vcn to the elbow  besides also an inflammation seized upon the middle 
part of his chest and there was  a certain disposition to a gan 
grene  whereby it followed that he was painfuUy and dangerously 
troubled with helchings liicketings watchings un quietness and 
frequent swoundings which occasioned many chirurgeons to leave him 
as desperate But it so fell out that I overcome by his friends 
entreaty undertook the cure of this wretched person destitute of 
all humane help Wherefore knowing the mortification by its signs I 
cut off the arm by the elbow as speedily as I could making flrst the liga 
ture  I say I took it off not with a saw but oncly with an incisionknile 
cutting in sunder the ligaments which held the bones together because 
the sphacel was not passed the joint of the elbow Neither ought this 
section to be counted strange which is made in a joint  for Hippocrates I 
anuch commends it and saith that it is easily healed and that there is I 
nothing to be feared therein besides swounding by reason of the pain I 
caused by cutting the common tendons and ligaments But such in I 
cisin being made the former ligature could not hinder but much blond I 
must flow from thence by reason of the large vessels that run that way I 
wherefore I let the bloud to flow plentifully so to disburden the pat I 
and so afterwards to free it from the danger of inflammation and a gan I 
grene  then presently I stanched the bloud with an hot iron for as yet I I 
knew no other course Then gentlv losing the ligature I scarified that I 
part of the brawn of the arm whioh was gangrcnated with many and I 
deep incisions shunning and not touching the inner part by the reason 
oE the multitude of the large vessels and nerves that run that way  then I 
presently applied a cautery to some of the incisions both to stanch the 
bleeding and draw forth the virulent  sanies which remained iif the 
part And then I assailed the spreading putrefaction by applying the 
formerly prescribed medicins  I used all sorts of restrictive meaicius to 
stay the inflammation of the chest I also applied epithimaes to the 
heart and gave him cordial potions and boles neither did I desist from 
vising them until such time as his helchings liicketings and swoundings 
had left him Whilst I more attentively intended these things another 
mischief assails my patient to wit convulsions and that not through 
any fault of him or me but through the naughtiness of the place wherein 
he lay which was in a barn everywhere full of chinks and open 
vHi every side  and then also it was in the midst of winter 
raging with frost and snow and all sorts of cold  neither had he any 
fire or anything necessary for preservation of life to lessen these injuries 
of the air and place Now his joints were contracted his teeth set and 
his mouth and face were drawn awry when I pitying his case made him 
to be carried into the neighbouring stable which smoaked with much 
ihorsedung and bringing in fire in two chafing dishes I presently 
anointed his neck and ail the spine of his back shunning the parts of the 
sliest with liniments formerly described for convulsions  then straight I 
way I wrapped him in a warm linncn cloth and buried him even to the I 
neck in hot dung putting a little fresh straw about him When he had 
stayed there some three days having at length a gentle scouring or flux I 
of his belly and plentiful sweat he oegan by little and little to open his I 
mouth and teeth which before were set and close shut Having got by 
this means some opportunity better to do my business I opened his 
mouth as much I pleased by putting this instrument between his teeth 
Now drawing out the instrument I Kept his mouth open by putting in a 
willowstick on each side thereof that so I might the more easily feed 
him with meats soon made as with cows milk and rear eggs until he had 
recovered power to eat the convulsions having left him He by this 
means freed from the convulsion I then again began the cure of his arm 
and with an actual cautery seared the end of the bone so as to dry up the 
perpetual afflux of corrupt matter It is not altogether unworthy of your 
knowledge that he said how that he was wondrously delighted by the 
application of such actual cauteries a certain tickling running the whole 
length of the arm by reason of the gentle diffusion of the heat by the ap 
plying the caustic  which same thing I have observed in others especially 
in such as lay upon the like occasion in the hospital of Paris After this 
cauterising ther fell away many and large scales of the bonebesides 
when there was place for fomentation with the decoction of red rose 
leaves wormwood sage bayleaves flowers of camomil and dill I so com 
forted the part that I also at the same time by the same means drew 
and took away the virulent  sanies which firmly adhered to the flesh 
and bones Lastly it came to pass that by Gods assistance these means 
I used and my careful diligence he at length recovered Wherefore I 
would admonish the young chirurgeon that he never account any so 
desperate as to give him for lost content to let him go with prognosticks  
for as an ancient doctor writesthat as in Nature so in diseases there 
are also monsters 
Translating this rather long case into our modern termin 
ology we find that this man had a compound comminuted 
fracture of the wrist  that he developed gangrene and I take 
it by the description of the convulsion that he also had 
tetanus Yet with all these complications and in spite of 
treatment he recovered I say in spite of treatment7 
ft 
idvisedly for apart from the gangrene knowing as we do 
hat tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacillus whose habitat 
s earth we wonder how he did get better seeing how com 
pletely this 
 
common souldier as he is called is placed 
inder the most unfavourable conditions possible for recovery 
ble undergoes amputation at the elbowjoint no doubt 
oughly performed and without an anaesthetic  he is bled 
reely  he is laid in a barn 
 
full of chinks in the midst of 
vinter with no comfort  and to crown all buried to the neck 
tor three days in 
 
fertiliser7 But he recovers One feels 
Lhat he himself deserves the credit of this rather than the 
surgeons skill 
What would be the present day 
treatment of such a case Y 
A soldier so shot through the wrist would be promptly or 
within a very short time picked up by the stretcherbearers a 
tourniquet or the first field dressing having probably in 
the meantime been applied He would then be taken to the 
eld hospital and further examined If there was much 
mashing of bones in due course he would be anaesthetised 
Loose fragments removed the wound thoroughly cleansed cut 
tendons sutured and an antiseptic dressing and splint put on 
lie might then be slowly passed down to the base and there 
carefully nursed back to healthwith in every probability the 
limb saved and serviceable If through any mischance 
tetanus supervened tetanus antitoxin would be injected and 
a disease overcome which has hitherto been dreaded by both 
surgeon and patient Looking both at the means and the 
results I think you will agree with me that surgery 
has a 
great deal to be proud of and the soldier a great deal to be 
thankful for in the progress shown between the two ex 
tremes of which these cases are types As a matter of fact I 
believe there has been a remarkable freedom from tetanus 
during the Boer war  at any rate I have not come across re 
cords of many cases 
Apart from the question of tetanus however the vast 
majority of cases of bullet injury seem to have run a most un 
eventful course Many reasons have been advanced for this 
pleasing result Mr Smith the civil surgeon in charge of 
the Surgical Division of No 9 General Hospital in an article 
in the British Medical Journal of April 20th suggests the 
following  
1 The sterility of the bullet owing to the heat engendered 
by its great rotatory velocity 
2 The purity of the atmosphere 
3 The hardened fit condition of the men 
4 The absence of serious oozing 
5 The absence of air or foreign bodies in the track 
6 The sun and the dry atmosphere which glaze and seal 
up the small wound before it has had time to become con 
taminated 
To these I think should be added  
7 Promptness of dressing this resulting from the fact 
that each man carries attached to his uniform a 
 
first field 
dressing which has been applied at once either by the 
wounded soldier himself or by a comrade as witness the 
large number of VCs awarded for such aid under fire 
8 The greater gentleness of handling and transport of in 
jured men owing to the greater extension of training of 
soldiers in 
 
first aid Increase of the damage is thus pre 
vented as there is not as in the past rough and unintelli 
gent though wellmeaning assistance given 
9 And in my opinion as the greatest of all is the in 
creased science knowledge and skill exhibited ly the sur 
geons of the Royal Army Medical Corps and their civil 
colleagues They are not the men themselves to call public 
attention to their work either in this r previous wars 
so that I think it behoves those who have watched and 
followed their work to call public attention to it and as the 
Government and the public do not give them the rewards and 
the credit to which they are entitled I hope it will be some 
solatium for them to know that their fellow civil practi 
tioners consider that their conduct and work has been such 
as well merits the commendation of 
 
Well done thou good and 
faithful servant 
Our eulogies of the RAMC cannot be too great nor our 
support 
and assistance to them too thorough in their fight 
against War Office starvation of the medical service and red 
tapeism Has any other unit of the South Africa Field Force 
I except the UAMC been expected to carry on war service

with a peace establishment And further with practically 
no reserve to draw upon except civil ambulance organisa 
tions to make up the wastage which occurs even in peace let 
alone in war Neither the artillery the cavalry or the in 
fantry was expected to do war work with its peace establish 
ment Yet the RAMC was  and astonishment was shown 
and abuBe scattered when it was proved to be a physical im 
possibility Worse still it was expected to do that work with 
really less than peace strength for it has been well known 
that even before the war broke out the numbers of the 
RAMC were far below those authorised even if that 
strength were sufficient for ordinary times Why was that  
Because the service was and is most unpopular and will be 
come more so unless radical alterations are made by the 
War Office as regards fair and equal treatment pay privi 
leges etc And unless the authorities are quick to recognise 
this they will soon have no RAMC left  for men already in 
leave it as soon as they can and there are none to take their 
places 
I feel that it behoves us to recognise the injustices done to 
our military brethren and to appeal to all to do what in them 
lies to bring about justice for that is all that is asked for 
the RAMC 
Returning now to the consideration of bullet wounds we 
find that in the classifying of gunshot wounds Par says that 
they are usually round on account of the bullets being 
round As a result of this he says   
All wounds which 
are made in mans body by gunshot whether simple or com 
pound are accompanied by contusion dilaceration dis 
temper and swelling  and up to the introduction of elon 
gated projectiles that was undoubtedly true and the injuries 
produced were correspondingly severe With the exception 
of shrapnel which are scattered on the explosion of a shell 
all bullets are now elongated The reason is that they are 
better able to take the grooving of the rifle which makes 
them rotate on the axis of the line of flight We thus get a 
flatter trajectory and therefore greater accuracy Another 
effect is muchincreased velocity and a longer range because 
more powerful explosives 
or propellants can be used and 
with the bullet fitting the rifle bore closely there is no waste 
of power behind Paradoxical as it may seem with all this 
greater accuracy and power there is now much less damage 
done than in the old days of the round bullet for the elon 
gated one by its high velocity and rotatory motion bores its 
way between planes of muscles bones blood vessels and 
nerves pushingthem to one side rather than smashing its 
way through There have been many cases reported in which 
this must have happened but I think the following is as 
typical as any I have read In A Subalterns Letters to his 
Wife he describes how 
Arnold a Vorkshireman belonging to Rimingtons Guides got a bullet 
through his head and yet rode fifteen miles into Bloemfontein without 
falling off his horse The bullet entered close to the orifice of one ear 
and came out through the lobe of the other Arnold smoked his pipe in 
hospital that same evening and next day he got out of bed to go back to 
his corps but was forcibly prevented by the nurse The following morn 
ing however he was discharged cured 
In this case I have no doubt the bullet had made its way 
amongst the muscles in front of the bodies of the cervical 
vertebrae also practically threading its way through the large 
vessels and nerves of the neck and just missing the mastoid 
processes The following is another interesting case de 
scribed by Mr Smith in the article which I mentioned 
before  
Private McK of the Inniskilling Fusiliers wounded at Colenso 
February 34th The bullet had passed obliquely through the lower part 
of the neck and the upper part of the thorax with entry at the centre of 
the left sternomastoid and exit in the right posterior axillary fold 
j inch external to the angle of the scapula It is difficult to imagine 
how the great vessels escaped The chief injury was to the left brachial 
plexus For some time he had complete motor and sensory paralysis of 
the arm Subsequently sensation returned and when I saw him though 
themuscles were weak and atrophied some motor power had returned 
to all except the group supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve 
Even in this case there cannot have been much more 
damage done than bruising and contusing or there could 
not have been the satisfactory result of the recovery of power 
and sensation that ensued Regarding the wound of entrance 
the area of the point of impact is much less than with a 
 For instance the St John Ambulance Brigade provided 1934 noncom 
missioned oflicers and men orderlies for South Africa and 5 for China 
in 40 contingents as required The War Oflcc acknowledgement is as 
usual when things medical are affected that is wanting 
round ballet and so the point of entry is naturally much 
less On the other hand the wound of exit is often crater 
like in its extent This may be because even in the short 
time that elapses between entrance and exit a reflex contrac 
tion in rear of the bullet concentrates the 
expansive and 
radiating force in the direction of the line of flight and so 
makes it focus the energy on the surfaces internal to the skin 
and on the skin itself finally bursting its way out and 
not infrequently carrying with it fragments of bone etc 
Another reason is that the bullet in its passage through 
the tissues may have its point knocked up or flattened 
or otherwise made irregular if it comes in oontact with a 
hard bone This is however not so common now unless 
the point of the bullet has its nickel casing filed or cut off so 
as to expose the lead or unless the bullet is of the softnosed 
or expanding variety which makes it practically the same as 
regards result I regret that there is abundant evidence that 
these bullets have been used Only a vengeful nature can 
justify the use of such for they maim and disable with much 
more unnecessary cruelty 
than is produced by the hard 
pointed pencil bullet which equally well places a man horn 
de combat but does it in a  
gentlemanly way and with not 
a tithe of the suffering nor with such an amount of permanent 
disablement 
The question of bullets which have been wilfully poisoned 
before being fired is an interesting one and one not 
brought 
up for the first time during the Boer war In describing  
wounds made by gunshot Par says  
Now to come to those who think that the venenate quality of wound 
made by gunshot springs not from the powder but from the bullet 
wherewith some poyson had been commixt or joyned or which hath 
been tempered or steeped in some poysonous liquor This may suf 
ficiently serve for a reply that the fire is abundantly powerful to dis 
sipate all the strength ot the poyson if any should be poured upon or 
added to the bullet This much confirma my opinion which everyone 
knows the bullets which the Kings souldiers used to shoot against the 
townsmen in the siege of Kouen were free from all poyson yet for all 
that they of the town thought they were all poysoned when they found 
the wounds made by them to be uncurable and deadly Now on the 
other side the townsmen were falsely suspected guilty of the same crime 
by the Kings army when as they perceived the Chirurgeons labour in 
curing wounds made by the bullets shot from Rouen to be frustrated by 
their contumacy and malign nature  each side judging of the magnitude 
and malignity of the cause from the unhappy success of the effect in 
curing Even as among physicians according to Hippocrates all 
diseases are called pestilent wftich arising from whatsoever common 
I cause kill many people  so also wounds made by gunshot may in some 
I respect be called pestilent for that they are more refractory and difficult 
I to cure than others and not because they partake of any poysonous 
I quality but by default of some common cause as the ill complections of 
I the patients the infection of the air and the corruptions of the meats 
I and drinks 
I venture to think that Par in speaking of infections 
and corruptions had anticipated our theories of sepsis of 
the present day though not quite on our lines And 
further you note how history repeated itself in that each 
side has charged the other with using poisoned bullets 
though I must confess that I have not come across any 
definite evidence proving it against the Boers and we do not 
have occasion to do such things in the British army even if 
we desired 
The probability is 1 think that many of the Mauser bullets 
have been in stock some time that they have been coated 
with some oily or fatty substance as a lubricant  that in 
the course of time this coating has become decomposed or 
turned rancid and the acid formed combining with the 
copper of the cartridge casing which is attached to the 
bullet has formed a copper salt and so produced the green 
or other coating which has been observed in certain bando 
liers or captured stores of ammunition I venture to submit 
this as the most likely reason for the unusual appearance of 
the bullets and which has originated the report that they 
were poisoned 
Passing to another division of military surgery I come 
across in Par records of the treatment and cure of pene 
trating wounds of the trunk cavities or of the hollow viscera 
And these therefore we can note as landmarks showing the 
great advance that has been made between the sixteenth and 
twentieth centuries  though I am not far wrong I think if I 
ptate that as much real progress has been made in the last 
fifty years as in the whole of the preceding three hundred 
and fifty For instance he describes the case of 
Captain Francis dAlon a native of Xantoign who before Rochel was 
shot with a musket bullet entrinp by the brcst bone near to the sword 
I likegrisle and passing through the fle9hy part of the midriff went out

I the space between the fifth and sixth bastard ribs The wound was 
healed up on the outside yet for all that there remained a weakness of 
the stomach whereupon a pain of the guts like to the colick took him 
specially in the evening and on the night for which cause he durst not 
sup but very sparingly But on the eighth moneth after the pain raging 
more violently in his belly than it was accustomed he died though for 
the mitigating thereof Simon Malmedy and Anthony du Val both learned 
physitians omitted no kind of remedy The body of the deceased was 
opened by the skilful chirurgeon James Guillemeau who found a great 
portion of the colickgut swelled with much wind gotten into the chest 
through the wound of the diaphragma for all it was so small that you 
could scarce put your little finger in thereat 
Further on he says  
Not long ago Giles le Maistre a gentleman of Paris was run through 
the body with a rapier so that he voided much blood at his mouth and 
fundament divers days together whereby you know the guts were 
wounded and yet he was healed in twenty days 
Another case he thus describes in his quaint way  
I can bring as a witness the steward of the Portugal embassadour 
whom I cured at Melun of a wound made with a sword so running through 
the body that a great quantity of excrements came forth of the 
wounded guts as he was a dressing yet he recovered 
As analogues of these cases I quote the following taken at 
random from the published records of No 9 General Hos 
pital and do not doubt that they are typical of possibly 
many hundreds more  
Case i Sergeant H of the Shropshires admitted April 30th wound 
of chest entering in front at the right border of the sternum in the fourth 
interspace exit behind the posterior axillary line at the level of the 
ninth rib Haemoptysis began instantly and continued for some days

Case 11Trooper B of the Imperial Yeomanry also a chest wound 
entering on the left side 1 inch internal and above the left nipple exit 
below angle of left scapula There was haemoptysis for three days but 
on the eighth day patient was up and the wouud practically healed It 
is almost impossible to suppose that the right auricle was not involved in 
the first of these cases and the left ventricle in the second A Mauser 
bullet may presumably pass through the thick muscular wall of the ven 
tricle and even penetrate the ventricular cavity without a fatal result 
owing to its small size but one can scarcely imagine that the thinwalled 
auricle could so escape

liquely through the abdominal cavity issuing on the left side immedi 
ately above the centre of the iliac crest A quantity of blood was vomited 
two hours after the wound but there was no subsequent hiematemesis

the pleura liver stomach colon and probably the small intestine must

The contrast between the cases of the sixteenth century and 
those of the nineteenth is very marked both as regards course 
and result  and as for the treatment in the latter series of 
cases a masterly inactivity that is as far as surgical 
action is concerned seems to have been the correct policy to 
pursue 
I am afraid I have only been able to touch very superficially 
in the time at my disposal upon the fringe of the subject in 
its modern phase but I trust that what I have said has once 
more emphasised a fact which unless we are careful we are 
apt to forgetnamely that there is no standing still in medi 
cineI use the word in its broadest sense It is a science 
which advances daily and we must take our lessons from 
everywhere we can Books old books new facts observa 
tions ideas statementsoldrevived or newall should help 
us to see and understand that medicine is one of the most 
rapidly advancing sciences and that we as its servants wish 
ing to do faithful service must be willing and able to learn 
our duty from each and every source

A CLINICAL LECTURE 
ON  
A CASE OF PURPURA RHEUMATTCA 
Delivered at the Western Infirmary Glasgow

Glasgow 
Symptoms 
The patient with whose case we are to occupy ourselves to 
day is a man aged 39 a  
holderon 
 
by occupation married 
and who has now been in hospital more than two months 
He was admitted on February 17th complaining of diarrhoea 
general weakness pain and swelling in some of his joints 
and an eruption situated chielly on his lower limbs I le can 
assign no cause for his illness The diarrhoea began about 
seven weeks before admission loose motions occurring from 
two to six times daily without any particular pain and 
during all this time he also had considerable discomfort and 
flatulence in the stomach after taking food These symptoms 
were accompanied by a marked feeling of weakness so much 
so that from the very beginning of his illness he was oil work 
and confined to the house or in bed About the same date his 
anklejoint and kneejoint became painful so that he expe 
rienced difficulty in walking  but he states that he did not 
notice any particular swelling in them till about a week be 
fore his admission The eruption on his legs was present 
from the beginning but does not seem to have particularly 
attracted his attention 
He is a healthylooking man is not emaciated or pale and 
has had no previous severe illnesses Seven years ago how 
ever he had an illness which he says was exactly similar 
to this but much slighter in degree He was treated for it as 
an outpatient of this infirmary and very soon recovered 
On admission his legs and thighs were covered with very nu 
merous purpuric spots mostly about the size of a pea but some 
were smaller and others much larger The smaller and medium 
sized ones were more or less round in shape but the larger 
were very irregular in outline and many of them elongated 
There were also petechiie and vibices but not in large numbers 
They appear in successive crops every few days hence some of 
them are of a bright purplishred colour and quite recent 
while others are fading They do not disappear on pressure 
and are not followed by desquamation There have sometimes 
been a few similar spots on the flanks and lower abdomen 
on the shoulders and upper arms but nowhere else Since 
admission sixtynine days days ago there have been twenty 
two distinct eruptions some much more abundant than others 
and chiefly on the lower limbs The fresh spots are of a bright 
purplishcrimson hue in a day or so they become dullred 
then of a lightrust colour slowly fading until in four or  
days they are almost imperceptible Some take on a faintly 
greenishyellow tint but although carefully observed we have 
never seen them pass through the familiar pronounced green 
and yellow tints seen in bruises and in scurvy Walking 
about the ward always developed an eruption at first but has 
now ceased to do so Each outbreak of spots is preceded for a 
few hours by pains in his large joints so that he can foretell 
their occurrence Both anklejoints have been slightly 
swollen during the whole time of his stay in hospital  
they are painful on manipulation and there is slight oedema 
along the borders of the tibiae The kneejoint shoulder 
joint and elbowjoint are also painful on movement 
and very slightly swollen The forearms are both 
slightly dematous and occasionally he has complained of 
pain in the muscles of the arms and legs The urine some 
times contains a trace of albumen and he has a little bronch 
itis His arteries are somewhat hard for his years but other 
wise the circulatory organs seem healthy His gums are 
slightly soft and spongy and bleed rather easily on pressure 
but he has never had any particular tendency to haemorrhage 
from this or any other mucous surface 
His blood was examined shortly after admission when the 
red corpuscles were found to number 4ccocoopercmm  the
