JAx 6 I90oo THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRIOA 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
From our Speclal Correspondent In Capetown 
December 18th 1899 
THE HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG 
SINCE my last letter wounded and sick have been steadily 
coming in As I mentioned No I General is practically full 
up No 2 has 262 patients to date The medical patients are 
still few as compared with the surgical but a few cases of 
dysentery and rheumatism are coming in Happily the 
RAMC is proving quite equal to the strain and every detail 
is being splendidly carried out Most commendable of all is 
the promptitude with which despite the difficulty of a single 
line of railway taxed to the utmost for other purposes the 
wounded are brought down to the base The field arrange 
ments are reported to me as being all that can be desired 
In view however of the certain prospect of an enormous 
accession of wounded from Lord Methuens column the per 
sonne is certain to be overworked and to partially provide 
for this the Principal Medical Officer at the base is calling for 
a number of recruits for the Cape Medical Staff Corps which 
is acting as an auxiliary to the RAMC Plenty of men are 
available who know something about first aid and stretcher 
drill but I doubt if more than a mere handful with any ward 
training can be obtained However the men offering are 
mostly intelligent and may be of some use in a few weeks 
No 2 Gneral Hospital 
No 2 General Hospital is now in full working order It 
is established on a gentle sandy slope very near No x the 
site being suitable in every way The hospital consists en 
tirely of marquees of the ordinary pattern Wooden floors are 
being laid for all the tents although a few of the first pitched 
had to be put up without them owing to lack of time As 
occasion offers however this deficiency will be remedied 
The erection of an operating room has been commenced in 
the meantime a marquee is being used Every provision is 
made for the comfort of the patients and I am quite prepared 
to find that the results may be even better there than in the 
permanent No I 
THE SANITARY ARRANGEWMENTS 
The hygienic arrangements are excellent Colonel Duke 
the Principal Medical Officer in charge is certainly an en 
thusiast in sanitary matters and has left no stone unturned 
in this respect There are no drains in the camp except one 
from the kitchen all liquid refuse being conveyed by hand 
cart tanks to absorption pits well below the camp All solid 
refuse such as medical dressings and the like are burnt on 
a site adjoining the absorption pits These latter act well in 
this sandy soil The contents disappear pretty rapidly and 
the surface is s kimmed daily or oftener Into the absorp 
tion pits refuse from the kitchen is conveyed by a short 
drain This drain also collects from a wellarranged and I 
should say very useful scullery behind the kitchen but re 
served entirely for washing cups plates and other utensils 
from the wards This scullery has a double row of zinc 
sinks flushed from hot and cold water taps led on from the 
kitchen This struck me as being a very useful adjunct to 
the hospital The latrines are to the upper side of the camp 
and are airy and well arranged The contents of the feces 
and urine tubs are removed nightly to the town depositing 
pits some miles away The latrines are furnished with a tap 
and sunk stone sink for washing tubs soiled with dysenteric 
or enteric exereta 
PROGRESS OF THEM WOUNDED 
The class of case in No 2 does not differ materially from 
No i although there is a large proportion of perforating 
abdominal wounds9 are in at present Curiously enough 
most of them have done well under expectant treatment a 
result at variance with most past experience Colonel Duke 
attributes this to the fact that most of the men sustained 
their injuries whilst fasting and thinks that the punctures 
inflicted on hollow viscera close up under these circum 
stances before extravasation can take place Five spinal 
cases are in the hospital with complete paraplegia Lamin 
eotomy has been performed on onejwithout reuibl The per 
forating chest wounds have done well almost uniformly 
Onecase I saw was interesting A Mauser bullet had enterec 
just to the right of the thyroid cartilage and emerged slightly 
to the right of the ligamentum nuchee an inch belowthe 
occipital protuberance No symptoms followed In anothier 
case a Mauser bullet had entered the malar bone on one side 
and emerged in the temporal region on the other The result 
has been anosmia and diplopia but no loss of visual acuity 
This hospital is just now short of thirty of its noncommhs 
sioned officers and rank and file personnel but being only par 
tially occupied the loss is not much felt The men were sent 
on to Natal directly they arrived In two or three days we 
may however expect that the casualties from Magersfonteii 
will fill up the place Whatever may happen in future 
everything is working smoothly now 
The Australian combined Field Hospital and Bearer Com 
pany is still here 
Other General Hlospitals 
No 3 General Hospital is being very rapidly erected under 
the energetic supervision of Colonel Supple and should be 
ready early next week No 4 has arrived but its location 
has notyet been fixed 
THE AMBULANCE TRAINS 
One of the ambulance trains is still being worked under 
RAMC officer and noncoms by a crew of St John men 
and I understand they are giving every satisfaction 
VOLUNTARY AMBULANCE AID 
Under the guiding hand of Colonel Young the chaos of 
voluntary help has assumed order on this side He has very 
wisely proceeded on the plan of doing nothing until he had 
arranged machinery capable of almost indefinite expansion 
As I mentioned before he has an office in the Bouses of 
Parliament and a store in the basement of the same building 
Mr Nethersole the Secretary of the Good Hope Society 
shares the office and works in conjunction with Colonel 
Young A lady of the Working Committee of the Society 
with three friends attendsdaily These ladies on Colonei 
Youngs instructions make purchases of comforts assist in 
clerical work sort out material and the like Just after the 
arrival of last mail I saw in the office a mass of mail bags 
directed after the postal manner to the various general and 
station hospitals in South Africa These contained the news 
papers sent out by the Red Cross sorted into sets by the 
ladies a very useful instance of the work they do The 
comforts supplied to the various hospitals are of the most 
varied characterfruit vegetables jellies pastry fans 
couches chairs mosquito nets games tobacco clothing and 
I know not what besides Many are of course sent direct by 
donors but Colonel Young is about to arrange a dep8t at 
Wynberg where an agent will receive donations and appor 
tion them between the two general hospitals at the base 
Hitherto nearly everything has gone to No i 
The Lines ot Communication 
With reference to the hospitals on the lines of communica 
tion Colonel Young in a journey from which he returned 
last week inaugurated a most excellent system the main 
feature of which is that everything is personally delivered 
Colonel Young has engaged Mr H E Abbott Assistant 
Secretary of the St John Centre as travelling agent This 
gentleman travels in the same train with all consignments 
and wires the approximate time of his arrival to the officer in 
charge of each hospital That officer then accredits some one 
to receive the consignment This course has been found 
necessary owing to the great risk under the present condi 
tions of railway pressure of consignments never reaching 
their destination At several stations small local committees 
supply the wounded in transit with comforts the material for 
which is generally sent up from here and cooked on the spot 
These committees also do some work at station hospitals 
where such exist One of the most useful things Colonel 
Young has arranged for is the supply of vegetables to the 
station hospitals on the lines These articles whilst plentiful 
enough in Capetown are practically unobtainable upcountry 
Another very useful gift has been that of 750 suits of pyjamas 
sent to the Orange River Hospital the advanced statiqn 
 This howitgl is we understand establshedd at Ptmdeboseih

These were made at the Countess of Bradfords village homes 
The Red Cross has also supplemented some of the surgical 
appliances at No 2 General 
Gifts from the Coloured People 
A very touching gilft made to the wounded was a sum of 
money contributed by the coloured lepers on Robben Island 
This move was entirely spontaneous 
The Coloured Peoples Political Union continue sending in 
large supplies of fruit vegetables and the like from 
Worcester and other districts round Capetown 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR

VII 
CASUALTIES 
THE total casualties in South Africa up to December 28th are 
given as follows 
Killed Wounded Missing Total 
Officers   82 258 98 438 
Men 886 3266 2223 6735 
968 3524 2321 6813 
This gives I to 36 as the proportion of killed to wounded 
which is higher than that originally returned as the result of 
Lord Methuens engagements nevertheless looking to the 
fact that the campaign in South Africa has been in active 
progress since October that large numbers of troops have 
been employed on both sides and that many engagements 
have occurred these losses as compared with the losses in 
European c3mpaigns are not heavy The following figures 
from Sir Thomas Longmores table are given by Stevenson 
in his Wound8 in War in the form of a table

From these interesting figures it will be seen that in many 
instances the losses in a single decisive battle as for instance 
at Waterloo and Inkermann were higher than those sus 
tained during the whole length of a campaign From the 
methods of fighting adopted by the Boers it is improbable 
that any conflicts involving the great losses of such battles as 
those referred to will occur The veld is wide and the Boer 
invariably prefers a retirement and the trial of a new position 
to facing at all serious losses on his own side The great 
majority of assaults on positions have been made by the 
British troops against the Boers Whenever the Boers have 
attempted similar assaults upon the English whether at 
Mafeking or Ladysmith their losses have been as great if not 
greater than ours under the same conditions 
CLIMATE AND CLOTHING 
I pointed out in my last article that the summer was well 
advanced in South Africa and a correspondent has written to 
inquire as to the relation of the summer to the rainy season 
as many of the telegrams speak of the rainy season in Natal 
as being about to begin The fact is the rainy season is the 
summer season in Natal and already as the letters of many 
war correspondents show heavy rains have fallen for some 
two months past in that country The seasons in South 
Africa may be divided into summer and winter spring and 
autumn scarcely existing The summer lasts from October to 
March the winter from April to September At Capetown 
and on the Cape Peninsula the rainfall is heavier during the 
winter months but throughout the rest of South Africa in the 
coast towns to the eastward as well as on the mountains 
encircling the interior plateau and on the plateau itself the 
rain falls chiefly or almost entirely during the summer 
months The amount varies considerably with the district 
As pointed out in Dr Hilliers article on The Geography and 
Climate of South Africa in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of 
December 2nd I899 the country for meteorological purposes 
may be divided into i coast terraces 2 the mountains 
and 3 the plains of the interior Thus to take one of the 
coast towns at Port Elizabeth the annual rainfall is about 
22 inches and falls on 49 days of the year On the coast ter 
races in such towns as Grahamstown Estcourt and Maritz 
burg the rainfall is as high as 2959 inches and occurs on 
some 77 days in the year On the mountains themselves such 
as the Hogsback the Stormberg in the Cape Colony and the 
Drakensberg in Natal north of Ladysmith the rainfall 
reaches as high as 40 inches and falls on 9 days On the 
interior plateau the rainfall is much less Thus at Beaufort 
West in the Karroo Cape Colony during the years I89596 
the average rainfall was only 97 inches and the number of 
days of the year on which rain fell was 27 Still further up 
on the borders of the German territory the rainfall was only 
120 inch during the course of the year and fell on 2 days 
It will thus be seen that the rainfall varies considerably 
throughout the different districts But wherever it falls it 
comes down usually in heavy storms during conlpsratively 
short periods of time drenching thunderstorms being a 
oommon form of rainfall The question then of what cloth 
ing may be required varies somewhat with the locality in 
which the soldier going to South Africa is likely to be engaged 
Thus in Natal the rainfall is referred to in several of the 
letters sent home We read in an extract from a letter of an 
officer writing from Estcourt on Nolvember igth 1899 and 
published in the Times 
The weather is most uncertain We have had several miserable days of 
a continuous drizzle with cold wind and then today is a ripping day 
My kit of 35 lb was very well chosen for a beginner I have a thick 
sweater which is a godsend as I carry it in my haversack and put it on at 
night when sleeping out 
For a period of some hours and sometimes for a day or two 
after rain even in the summer months the cold is distinctly 
felt The rapid evaporation which occurs in the normally dry 
atmosphere after the earth is saturated with rain largely 
accounts for this cooling process and under these conditions 
the campaigner sleeping in a canvas tent will find the protec 
tion of a sweater and warm clothing especially for sleeping in 
invaluable The woollen nightcap must always be available 
for use after the rains in the summer and for continuous use 
through the winter On the plains of the high veld which 
are now the scene of Lord Methuens operations south of Kim 
berley and indeed throughout the grass plains extending over 
the Free State and southern Transvaal the rainfall as has 
already been pointed out is considerably less and occurs on 
rare occasions and although the cooling effect of a storm is 
felt here it is not felt to any such marked extent as on the 
coast terraces At the present time the heat suffered by our 
troops on these plains is by far the most trying feature of the 
climate thus Mr Makins in his letter published in the 
JOURNAL last week speaks of the temperature in some of the 
canvas tents being as high as II5 F 
The question of what clothing will be required will there

fore be seen to present some difficulty Personally when 
consulted on this subject I have invariably recommended 
tiat at least one of the regulation suits should be of khaki 
coloured serge and not of cotton khaki itself Cotton khaki 
is a splendid material for the sunshine and dust of the 
average summer day in the field on the plains but is not a 
good material to get wet in During wet weather the serge 
would be much safer and more comfortable flannel shirts 
brown leather boots khaki puttees with cashmere socks are 
the best articles for everyday wear It is as well to have no 
hooks on the boots as they are very apt to get broken or to 
t in the way when preAsed against the stirrup in riding 
ILiding breeches are better made of worsted cord 
THE COMMISSARIAT 
In spite of the fact that the troops at Chieveley Esteourt 
and on the Modder River are in touch with the railway a 
certain amount of occasional hardship does appear by the 
letters from the correspondents to have been endured by our 
troops in reference to commissariat This we may believe 
has been temporary and accidental but in view of the tre 
mendous lengLh of our lines of communication and the de 
pendence of our soldiers on supplies from the bases it is in 
teresting to learn from the Times that a feature in connection 
with the provision of supplies is found in portable rations 
Each 2OZ tin although only 2 in in height and Ii in across contains 
all the needful ingredients for I pint of most nutritious soup with the ad 
dition only of that quantity of hot water salt pepper and all the needful 
seasoning being included in the tin In the absence of other provisions 
the soup thus made is sufficient for a meal or at least to keep a man going 
until he can obtain a more solid repast With his food in this consoli 
dated form a soldier can carry about with him rations enough to last him 
if needs be for four or five days a mule can carry I500 tins a camei 
over 2000 and a Cape wagon will hold about 6oooo In addition to the 
orders which are being executed for the Government large quantities 
alike of consolidated soups and of desiccated vegetables are being sent out 
for the canteens of various regiments 
SIR JAMES SIVEWRIGHTs AMBULANCE 
Through the Exchange Telegraph Company we were 
informed on December 2ISt that Mr Kruger had declined 
Sir James Sivewrights offer of an ambulance for the use of 
the Boers on the ground that he does not receive such gifts 
from an enemy 
Sir James Sivewright is we confess a somewhat difficult 
person to understand Is it that his heart is too large or that 
he believes a fence the most comfortable of seats  He is an 
exColonial Minister in the Cape Government he is a mem 
ber of the Afrikander Bond he has offered an ambulance 
party to Mr Kruger for attendance upon wounded Boers and 
he has offered certain farmhouses in the vicinity of Capetown 
to the Imperial authorities for the accommodation of wounded 
Imperial officets This last offer has been declined The 
course of the ambulance party since its departure from 
Aberdeen has been by no means smooth Many of the 
gentlemen attached to this ambulance are the sons of South 
African Boers whose sympathies in so far as they have any 
political colour are probably more with the Boers than with 
our men in the present conflict On the arrival of the ambu 
lance in South Africa we are told that it was refused permis 
sion to go through our lines and thus overland to Pretoria 
and now unkindest cut of all Mr Kruger says he does 
not receive such gifts from an enemy That Sir James 
Sivewright should be accused of being anyones enemy will 
we are sure hurt him acttely What has happened to the 
members of the ambulance since Mr Krugers refusal 
it is somewhat difficult to gather but it has been stated that 
disappointed Dutch medicos have now in their individual 
capacity offered their services to the Transvaal It is quite 
possible that if these offers have been made they will finally 
be accepted by Mr Kruger on the explicit understanding 
that these gentlemen are willing to take up arms on behalf of 
the Transvaal Should this eventuality arise Sir James 
Sivewright will have been placed in an unenviable position 
MILITARY HoSPITAL CCOMM1OATION AT CAPETOWN 
The Tiimes correspondent of December 23rd states that 
complaints have been freely made for some time past 
about the military hospital accommodation at Capetown 
This in no way affects the admirable surgical skill or the 
care of the medical officers but there is a want of organisa 
tion and foresight in the arrangements and an absence of 
those minor comforts which are necessarily dispensed with 
at the front but are easily procurable at Oapetown The 
whole establishment of the permanent hospitals was calcu 
lated on too small a scale at the beginning and has never 
been completely recast since while the standard of comfort 
especially for officers is too low This telegram which is 
continued in the same strain at some length is not of a 
satisfactory character but we have little doubt that the 
minor defects unavoidable in the hastilyarranged hospital 
on which the demands have exceeded anticipation will 
promptly be remedied The Army Medical Department 
have to our knowledge engaged a certain number of experi 
enced civilian surgeons in South africa and among the 
refugees from Johannesburg alone are many capable men 
whose services might be enlisted by the department should 
further occasion for such additional aid arise 
WOUNDED AND SICK AT WOOLWICH 
All the wounded and invalids admitted to the Herbert 
Hospital Woolwich on January 2nd from the steamer 
Garth Castle had wonderfully improved by the voyage 
home from South Africa The cases with four ex 
ceptions had become convalescent and are asking to 
be sent back to duty The wounds of all those ad 
mitted to the surgical division have closed and the 
majority are fit for duty whilst the gunshot injuries 
to bones and joints are comparatively trivial and all likely 
under further treatment shortly to recover the free use 
of their limbs Photographs are being taken by the Roentgen 
rays of the wounds and injuries to joints and bones of the men 
who have last arrived from South Africa The choice of foods 
is varied and all praise the attention shown to them not only 
during the voyage home but since their arrival at Woolwich 
by the military medical authorities at the Herbert Hospital 
At a time when every available bed in the home hospitals is 
likely to be required it will probably be thought well to send 
invalids incapacitated and unfit for further duty to their 
homes or to convalescent institutes as soon as it is possible 
for them to pass the Board and to leave hospital The 
numerous offers of convalescent accommodation now being 
made may therefore not improbably soon be taken up 
A BASE HOSPITAL FOR THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY 
The Princess of Wales has become President of a Com 
mittee of ladies formed to raise a fund of 430000 to establish 
a base hospital for the Imperial Yeomanry at Capetown It 
is proposed that ambulance and stretcher bearers should also 
be provided The scheme for providing medical aid for the 
Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa will have to be carefully 
thought out and in any case it is clear that it must be of such 
 nature as to work easily with the existing medical arrange 
ments for the regular army upon which in fact it must be 
3rafted 
TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMBNTS

AN APPEAL TO THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF 
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 
IN the crisis through which our Empire is passing the im 
portance of the Militia Yeomanry and Volunteer Forces as a 
support to the Army is fully evinced And as it is impossible 
to forecast the further demands which may have to be made 
upon them in the near or distant future it behoves us to 
strenuthen them to the utmost of our power 
Many members and students of our profession are already 
enrolled in them and are answering the call now made upon 
them with patriotic promptitude 
We venture to take the opportunity suggested by the begin 
ning of a new year of appealing to such of the younger mem 
bers and of the students of the medical and dental professions 
as are still unattached yet capable of bearing arms or in other 
ways of helping in Imperial defence at once to consider the 
advisability of joining some branch of the Eervice

LITERARY NOTES 
DR GEORGE M GOULD is reprinting the editorial  Sugges 
tions to Writers which have appeared during the past year 
in the Philadelphia Medical Journal The volume will be 
entitled Suggestions to Medical Writers and will be an octavo 
of about I50 pages In addition to the articles which have 
already appeared in the Philadelphia Medical Journal the 
book will contain a general introductory chapter on Medical 
English a chapter on Medical Paleography and a new essay 
entitled History and Psychology in Words 
Among the curiosities of the Oxyrhynchus papyri which 
have been edited with translations and notes by Messrs 
Grenfell and Hunt for the Egyptian Exploration Fund Part II 
London Henry Frowde 25s is a list of specifics for the ear 
ache They date from about the end of the second century 
and are as follows 
Heat an equal quantity of beavermusk and poppy juiceupon apotsherd 
if possible one of Attic make but failing that of  soften by diluting 
with raisin wine warm and drop in Dilute some gum with balsam of 
lilies and add honey and rose extract Twist some wool with the oil in it 
round a probe warm and drop in Pound some closed calices of pome 
granates drop on saffron water and wben it becomes discoloured draw 
the liquor off When required dilute as much as the bulk of a pea with 
raisin wine warm and drop in Pound some Egyptian alum and insert 
into the ear an amount equal to the size of a pea Anoint a persea leaf 
and insert Thoroughly moisten a flock of wool with the gall of an ox 
roll up and insert Poundmyrrh and alum in equal quantities and insert 
Dilute frankinceice with verysweet wine and syringe the ear or use for 
this purpose the injections described above Rinse with warm onion 
juice Syringe with gall of a bull or goat or sheep or other similar kind 
of gall warmed The sap of a pine tree warmed io be used in the same 
way 
TheIirst specific must have been something not very unlike 
the old vinum opii which not very many years ago was 
largely used as a local application in various painful affections 
especially of the eyes while  warm onion juice  is a popular 
remedy the use of which hag by no means died out at the 
present day The s ap of a pine tree warmed shows perhaps 
some dim striving after antisepsis 
The current number of the Fortnightly Review contains a 
very interesting article on the problems which await solution 
in South Africa by Dr Alfred Hillier He has given it the 
title Issues at Stake in South Africa and the subject is dis 
cussed from a point of view slightly different from that 
usually adopted He dwells on the influence on the cha 
racter and political standard of the Transvaal Boers exerted 
by their long contact with native races They have held 
these races in subjection and individual members of them 
in slavery more or less openly avowed This he

closely reasoned and expressed in temperate and well 
balanced language The article will well repay perusal
