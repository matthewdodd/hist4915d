HuDLIConS observations lead him to believe that there is 
no one or any set of the abnormalities which run through 
such a number of subjects as to justify its being considered 
typical of the asylum children White children of both sexes 
were found to possess on an average a decidedly larger pro 
portion of inborn abnormalities than the negroes but the 
latter acquire in early life a larger percentage of irregularities 
than do the white children In thenegroes both the pressure 
and traction fo ce were found to exceed at all ages similar 
forces in the white children though the average weight of the 
latter exceeds that of the former On the whole Dr Hrdlicka 
does not appear to attach the significance which has been 
attributed by some to pljysical abnormalities for he italicises 
the following statemeIJt As amatterof fact therearevery few 
abnormalities which we can observe in man that may be posi 
tively said to render the individual generally either decidedly 
inferior or markedly superior to his fellowbeings No single 
physical abnormality and but a rare combination of abnor 
malities suffices of itself to stamp any individual as a human

The Plague Inspector by LieutenantColonel W G KING 
IM S is a book of over i6o pages defining and explaining 
the duties of a plague inspector in India It was written be 
cause something of the kind was asked for over and over 
again by plague supervisors to guide them in their work Dr 
King has accomplished the task he has set himself in a most 
satisfactory manner The book is free from technical medical 
r hraseology and is written in a style that can be readily fol 
lowed by laymen It is divided into two parts Part I begins 
with a short account of plague a description of the plague 
microbe with the favourable and unfavourable conditions 
for its vitality thp animals that suffer from plague the incu 
bation period of plague the products of the plague microbe 
mode of entry of the microbe into the system and the 
mode of exit of the microbe from the body Then follow 
the symptomtntology of the disease its mode of transmission 
and the organisation for prevention of spread the regulation 
of passenger traffic by sea and the regulation of importation 
of articles from infeeted areas or country The duties of the 
sanitary inspector with reference to plague are carefully and 
minutely gone into and includes arrangements for home 
segregation removal to hospital house to house inspection 
formation of health camps and disinfection Part II refers 
more to the general duties of a sanitary inspector and deals 
more especially with conservancy and sewage dispos al We 
hope the labour which LieutenantColonel King has expended 
on this manual will bear fruit and that full advantage will be 
taken of the knowledge he has placed within the reach of those 
engaged in sanitary work in Indlia 
A Manual of Pharmaceutical Testing by BARNARD S PROCTOR 
FIC gives such directions for testing as will show the 
quality of pharmaceutical chemicals with such reagents and 
appliances as are to be found at the dispensing counter The 
object of the author has been to enable the pharmacist in the 
simplest speediest and most inexpensive way to be able to 
decide whether an article is fit for use In many instances 
the Brstieh Pharmacopwia tests are sufficiently simple and 
satisfactory for the purpose but in a cousjiderable number of 
cases other and simpler methods of attaining the required 
object are given The second edition crown 8vo pp 200

Arch Support for Flat FootMr F H DAVIES MB has 
submitted to us an arch support for flat feet It consists as 
seen in the illustration of a thin plate of steel in two planes 
one of which is deeply dentated and forms a lateral support 
for the arch of the foot it fits in between the os calcis and 
the ends of the metatarsal bones The plate is covered with 
leather when in use It is claimed that the springs indi 
vidually yield to pressure and thus accommodate themselves 
to the undersurface of the arch but collectively offer suffi 
cient resistance to prevent the stretching ef the ligaments 
The flat part of the steel plate being under the outer part of 
the foot is fixed and acts as a fulcrum from which the 
springs play This sprtLng plate is an endeavour to combine 
the advantages of the elastic rubber pad with the firm sup 
port given by a Whitmans brae and as such it will probably 
be of service in cases of early flat foot with islight bony dis 
placement 
A Modified Displaysg Nasal SpeculumDr G SANDIsoN 
BRaoOK Rome writes In the removal of nasal polypi from 
the deeper parts with the aid of the ordinary Duplay speen 
lum I have experienced difficulty in manipulatinig the snare 
from not being able to remove the speculum from the handle 
of the instrument To obviate this Messrs J Gardner and 
Son Edinburgh folloing m2y Suggestion have made for me 
a modification of th Duplay by dividing its wide anterior 
ring in a vertical diection so as to render the two blades 
readily separable when desired the parts of thle ring when 
the speculum is in use being Recured in position by a gate at 
one side and by a bayonet joint at thle other wee figure

A Modified Nasal SpeCulumDR G HUNTER MACKENZIE 
Edinburgh writes The Duplay nasal speculum has two dis 
advantagesit is difficult to clean thoroughly and when in 
use is apt to be in the way during an operation Thus in the 
removal of certain varieties of polypi after the speculum has 
been used to facilitate the fixing of the snare it would be an 
undoubted advantage if during the actual operation it could 
be removed from the nose To overcome these disadvantages 
1 have had the instrument modified by the addition of a 
couple of screws so that it can be readily separated into 
halves and when operating freed from the snare at the will of 
the user After a fair experience I am certain that the modi 
fication is an improvement on the ordinary instrument It 
has been made for me by Messrs Young and Son Forrest

chloride contain 30 grains and those of sodium chloride and 
sodium sulphate iS grains each of the two salts Soloids 
sodium chloride compound are composed of sodium chloride 
sulphate carbonate phiosphiate with potassium chloride 
These soloids are very convenient for the ready preparation 
of solutions which are generally required in a hurry Two of 
the soloids dissolved in a pint of sterilised water at a 
temperature of woo0 F form a solution of proper strength for 
injection By means of soloid lead subacetate a solution 
approximating in the quantity of lead subacetate to the 
official liquor plumbi subacetatis dil can be immediately 
peae Solids lead and opium lotion contain 20 grains 
ledaeate and the dry constituents Of 20 minims of tincture 
opium in each These soloids on account of their portability 
and the ease with which the solutionsj can be prepared will 
be found especially convenient to travellers

THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE SPANISH 
AMERICAN WAR 
THE Philadelphia Medical Journal of November 25th published 
SurgeonGeneral G M Sternbergs Medical Report of the 
United States Army for the Financial Year i8989 It deals 
with the fiscal year ending June 30th 1899 and consists of two 
parts the first financial the second dealing with the health 
of the trooPs 
As it embraces the active period of the Spanish war it is of 
special interest to us in its bearing on our South African cam 
paign 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
This statement at once shows how widely the constitution 
of the medical service of the United States army differs from 
our own in possessing a complete financial autonomy em 
bracing the procuring and distribution of hospital supplies 
and even inclading what is properly looked upon as largely a 
medical dutyrecruiting and mustering out of invalids It is 
therefore only in certain directions that the two services can 
be fairly compared 
APPROPRIATION AND EXPENDITURE 
The money voted for the medical service during the year in 
review was 3750000 about 765000 of which there was 
expended 2750000 about Z564000 
The large item in these accounts is medical supplies 
This we take to embrace hospital dietary which in a country 
like the United States is sure to be on a very liberal scale 
Other considerable items are for medical attendance and 
medicines pay of  nurses  and other  employees  hos 
pital washing etc 
MEDICAL OFFICERS 
The number of medical officers in the regular army was i92 
which was barely sufficient for the needs of the service in 
time of peace with a strength of 25000 men and of course 
utterly insufficient for the war or to meet an increase in the 
establishment of regulars independent of volunteer estab 
lishments 
It was therefore necessary to employ about 940  contraet 
surgeons during the year of whom 385 were still serving on 
July ist I899 Sometbing of the same kind is now going on 
in our own undermanned medical establishments 
FEMALE NURSES 
The female contract nurses reached a maximum of I200 in 
September I898 and 202 were still employed on July ist 1899 
HOSPITAL SHIPS 
The Belief and the Missouri which were Government ships 
did excellent service between Cuba and the Philippines and 
the home country but the Aid formerly the Bay State and 
the Terry proved unsuited for hospital purposes for reasons 
which are not given 
RECRUITING 
During the calendar year 1898 66237 white and 5013 
coloured recruits were examined for the regular army of 
that a little over 20 per cent only were rejected This is 
much below the primary rejections among our own recruits 
and apparently admits of a double explanation First men 
in America are enlisted up to a later age and are therefore 
more developed secondly the medical examination is evi 
dently less exacting Nevertheless the chief cause of rejec 
tion there as here is defective physique while defective 
vision seems more common than with us and diseases of the 
 circulatory system which we presume can only mean 
varix and varicocele and cardiac affections among recruits are 
also more common 
Irish and Germans formerly constituted a fifth of the 
United States regular army or 200 in every iooo but they 
have recently steadily decreased until in 1895 they were but 
go per IooO  the native born have risen correepondingly 
Notwithstanding the smallness of the army and the large 
ness of the recruiting field and the consequent opportunity 
for strict selection a considerable  delinquent  and  unde 
sirable element has constantly to be weeded out of the 
United States forces of which some figures are given

HEALTH OF THE ARMY 
It is noted with regret that even in the regulars and still 
more among the volunteers failure to keep and furnish 
accurate and complete recordsespecially in Cuba during 
July and Augustmakes the returns incomplete and the 
ratios less than they undoubtedly actually were this how 
ever with the scratch medical establishment employed is 
scarcely to be wondered at 
REGULAR ARMY 
With a mean strengtlh for the war year of 46635 the 
admissions were at the rate of 2136 per iooo or over two 
entries per man and double the entries during peace The 
excess was due to various camp diseases of which the chief 
were malarial affections and typhoid fever 
The deathrate was 2755 per ioCo against a decennial 
average of 699 or nearly four times the normal amount The 
number of days sick for each man was likewise double the 
average 
Of the different corps the infantry suffered most but the 
deathrate was very high among hospital attendants chiefly 
from typhoid fever contracted in their ministrations on the 
sick 
The admissions were especially swollen by malarial dis 
eases but there were no fewer than 4130 admissions from 
typhoid and 604 from yellow fever there were only I547 
from gunshot wounds 
The deathrate of 2755 per iooo was made up thus 
Typhoid fever 974 gunshot wounds 394 malarial fevers 324 
diarrhcea and dysentely 214 yellow fever I5o injuries other 
than gunshot i6i all other causes 538 Although the troops 
were exposed to dangerous infection in the islands from 
smallpox there were only 19 cases and 7 deathssuch was 
the efficiency of revaccination The highest admissionrate 
was in Porto Rico and Cuba that in the Philippines was the 
same as in the United States itself 
The total deaths between May ist 1898 and June 30th 
I899 among regulars and volanteers was 66I9 or an annual 
rate of 3303 per iooo of strength altocated as follows Cuba 
4514 Porto Rico 38I5 Manila 1720 United Stattes 
Regulars 1743 volunteers 2667 
Typhoid fever aocounted for more than half the deaths from 
disease and was worst in Porto Rico yellow fever was worst 
in Cuba 
SANITARY CONDITION 
The sanitary condition of the permanent camps before the 
war was excellent but the new camps formed on the out 
break of the war and filled with undisciplined volunteers 
speedily became hotbeds of disease especially of typhoid 
fever from which they suffered severely in July and August 
Much good sanitary work has been done in Cuba since its 
occuDation in December last so that the amount of sickness 
in the camps and garrison has been much less than was 
expected scattered cases of yellow fever have occurred but 
its absence in epidemic form has afforded great satisfaction 
The sanitary measures brought to bear on Santiago hitherto 
one of the most unhiealthy spots in Cuba have proved remark 
ably successful In Porto Rico also effective sanitation has 
been equally successful in controlling disease and especially 
has an important attempt been made to suppress its worst 
diseasesmallpox by wholesale vaccination of the popula 
tion For that purpose a vaccine farm was formed at Coamo 
Springs 
Sanitary measures at Manila and elsewhere in the Philip 
pines have been carried out with great labour but with much 
success so that the sickness and mortality have been not 
only relatively but absolutely low 
WATER SUPPLIES 
Much attention has been bestowed on this point so that the 
supply to the various camps has uniformly been excellent In 
no case was the rapid spread of typhoid conceded to be due to 
water pollution 
Various methods of sterilising drinking water have been 
tried but simple boiling was found at once the readiest and 
most effectual although it makes the water insipid and un 
popular The best filtering agents were found to be an 
asbestos strainer with a cylinder of compact infusorial earth 
The whole question of sterilising and aerating water was re 
ferred to a Board who recommended the use of the apparatus 
known as the WaterhouseForbes water steriliser 
CONSERVANCY 
The disposal of exereta in pits in camps of any long stand 
ing was found to be fraught with danger unless most 
vigilantly looked after and constantly disinfected After 
various experiments the most promising method was that 
known as the  trough system with removal of the contents 
by pneumatic pressure This has been successfully esta 
blished in several camps 
FOOD SUPPLIES 
The subsistence or as we call it the supply departments 
worked exceedingly well and were constantly efficient Many 
reports were received that the ordinary home ration was un 
suited for the tropics in containing too much of the fatty and 
too little of the starchy elements 
The 6o per cent allowance for subsistence in hospitals 
proved more than ample and enabled the medical officers to 
provide freely every delicacy for the sick indeed a 40 per 
cent allowance is declared to be sufficient 
CLOTHING 
The blue uniform used in the States was found too heavy 
for Cuba and the Philippines and the woollen undershirts 
caused much irritation from prickly heat Canvas suits until 
washed soft were found to be too stiff and heavy and caused 
chafing and a similar complaint was made of one of the 
khaki issues The British Indian helmet was found the best 
headgear although after the rains set in the campaign 
hat  was found to have certain advantages over the helmet 
The clothing finally recommended in the tropics is a light 
weight woollen undershirt cotton drawers white duck for 
garrison and khaki for field service 
CONCLUSIONS 
From all of the foregoing it will be seen the experiences of 
our American friends in tropical warfare have been singularly 
like our own and confirm what has long been well known to 
our army medical officers We look less for new facts than 
for the application of new methods which their great inventive 
skill is likely to evolve 
SurgeonGeneral Sternberg concludes his report with cer 
tain recommendations concerning his army medical service 
which are equally applicable to our own and which we have 
long and often urged on our War Office 
He points out the entire inadequacy of the regular army 
medical service and urges its increase as soon as practicable 
He says  Physicians and surgeons from civil life however 
well qualified professionally as a rule are not prepared to 
assume the responsibilities of medical officers charged with 
administrative duties and sanitary supervision of camps The 
proper performance of such duties cannot be expected from  
physician without military training or experience no matter 
how distinguished a position he may have held in civil 
life 
He urges the organisation of  a corps of trained medical 
officers larger than is absolutely necessary for the army on a 
peace basis 
He has thus found the danger and difficulty of a scratch 
medical organisation in time of war a lesson which indeed 
may yet be brought home to ourselves As the war with 
Spain evolved the weak points of the American army system 
so our own deficiencies are certain to be found out in the 
Boer war 
It must be the immediate business of the nation to remedy 
them 
IDIOCY IN THE BALEARIC ISLANDSE J5ajarnes y Tur in a 
recent number of the Revista Balear de Scienc Med compares 
the number of idiots in the Balearic Islands with that in 
Spain He finds that both in the islands and in the town of 
Palma de Mallorca just as in Spain and France idiocy more 
commonly affected the male than the female sex and that the 
number of cases of acquired idiocy was greater than that of 
congenital idiocy The proportion of idiots in Spain was 
054 per Icoo in the Balearic Islands it was o43 per Icoo and 
in the town of Palma it was o63 per iooo The high percent 
age in Palma is ascribed specially to sociological conditions
