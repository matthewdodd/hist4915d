In April of this year I had previously treated her for quinsy 
which took practically the same course as the present attack 
but without extension to the other side I saw her again in 
the evening and found that the swelling had extended to the 
suprahyoid region Her pulse had risen to 120 her temper 
ature still 99o I ordered her to be well fed with fluid meat 
extracts beeftea etc and freely stimulated There was no 
doubt what the trouble was On the 18th the swelling had 
extended to the nape of the neck behind and was spreading 
down the chest There was no evidence of fluctuation in the 
swelling 
but it was brawny hard tender and the skin a 
dark red in colour I ordered three bottles of antistrepto 
coccus serum from Allen and Hanburys and gave one injection 
about 6 pm and another about 10 pm 
There was no improvement in her condition and she died 
on the 19th there was no loss of consciousness until imme 
diately before she died The temperature was never above 
99o after the first day of the illness this being due to the 
severity of the poison 
It is I think rather uncommon to see quinsy in patients 
of this age but I think it is quite common to find il affecting 
rst one side and then the other

CASE OF INFECTION OF LEPROSY THROUGH A 
WOUND 
j T 54 widow Italian was admitted to the Hospital 
Samaritano Sao Paulo Brazil in February 1890 with a well 
marked scirrhus of the left breast The whole breast was 
removed as well as the axillary lymphatics and those subjacent 
tfco the pectoral muscles The examination of the tumour 
proved it to be a cancer of the typical scirrhus type The 
whole of the wound healed by first intention with the excep 
tion of the sternal end where for some unknown reason sup 
puration occurred and the stitches had to be removed for 
drainage Healing was very slow but in about a month she 
left the hospital with a small superficial granulating surface 
uncicatrised She returned once or twice for dressing and 
then disappeared for some months During her stay in 
ttiospital absolutely nothing suggestive of leprosy was observed 
On the contrary with the exception of the breast tumour she 
looked a healthy and exceptionally fat woman The breasts 
were very large and adipose 
In July 1899 about six months after the above operation 
she returned to hospital and on examining the cicatrix a 
wartylooking patch was found near the inner end and on 
the upper side with a few hard illdefined nodules along 
the inner half of the cicatrix 
She would not remain in hospital at this time but about 
iiwo weeks later she returned complaining of what she called 
erysipelas of the face Her face presented a number of deep 
red elevated shiny swellings more or less symmetrically 
arranged and giving the patient a sensation of intense heat 
or burning The sites of these patches were the supra 
orbital regions the malar prominences along the lower jaw 
and over the chin Similarlooking patches were found on 
her arms and legs Some of them were in the shape of large 
rings chiefly about the elbows and on the forearms the 
enclosed skin having a bleached and dry look Most of these 
areas were completely or partially ansesthetic anaesthesia 
was also found over extensive areas of the legs chiefly on the 
outer aspect of the right leg and left ankle On examining 
the mammary region there was found around the part of the 
cicatrix that had healed 
by granulation an extensive area of 
kin with the same deep red hue  the skin looked very coarse 
and had a brawny feel The patient stated that the 
 
ery 
sipelas began first at this place and afterwards appeared 
on the face and limbs During her stay in hospital several 
fresh patches appeared 
on the legs and arms having the 
ame characteristics Dr Lutz saw the patient with me at 
this stage and agreed that she had a very acute infection 
of leprosy 
The woman who belonged to the lower class had been 
many years in Brazil Her husband died some years ago as 
the result of an accident She had one married daughter and 
neither her husband nor daughter ever suffered from any 
disease like hers By chance I learned from a visitor that 
the woman had a son who was suffering from a skin 
I disease and I succeeded in examining this son He was a 
youth of 18 who for three years had been suffering from 
typical leprosy of the mixed tubercular and anaesthetic 
form His face had the wellknown leonine expression and 
the alae nasi and lobes of the ears presented welldeveloped 
tubercles On his legs and arms he had deeplypigmented 
blotches and numerous anaesthetic areas Since his illness 
became pronounced he has always lived with his mother 
This case is a very interesting one furnishing as it does 
very strong evidence that the bacillus leprae can find an 
entrance through an open wound In all my experience of 
leprosy now extending over some sixteen years this is the 
first case in which I have been able to discover with any 
degree of certainty the source and mode of infection

PRETORIA HOSPITAL TRANSVAAL 
A DERMOID CYST IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCROTUM I 
OPERATION 
By Herbert J Godwin MB BS MRCS LRCP 
late Civil Surgeon to the South African Field Force  
Acting Surgeon to the Pretoria Hospital 
Transvaal Colony 
W A G was admitted suffering from a swelling of the right 
side of the scrotum about the size of a cocoanut 
HistoryThe patient a fairly healthylooking man aged 
42 stated that he had always had a swelling on the right 
side of the scrotum He was a married man and had had 
seven children six of whom were living He also stated 
that his father had a similar swelling and also his the 
patients eldest son This swelling gave him no trouble till 
a few months previously and just before the British 
occupation 
of Pietersburg Transvaal Colony he consulted a medical man 
who tapped it and drew off a small quantity of fluid He 
then came to Pretoria and consulted another medical man 
who tapped it and injected it with iodine Three days later 
the swelling became much larger and very painful 
Condition on AdmissionThe right side of the scrotum was 
enormously swollen red and fluctuating The superficial 
veins were very large and prominent The swelling was very 
tense and painful to touch The left testicle was normal 
Operation The patient was put under chloroform and a 
free incision made  putrid gas and pus came out in abund 
ance This collection was between the tissues of the scrotum 
and tunica vaginalis The tunica itself was found to be very 
much thickened  an incision was made into it and on intro 
ducing the finger the whole cavity was found to contain hair 
and cartilage with signs of commencing suppuration The 
cord was then tied and the whole mass removed The cord 
was twice as large as normal the arteries and veins being the 
same 
Examination of the TumourIt was found to be a cyst the 
wall of which was quite J inch thick  it was completely nlled 
with a mass of brown hair and projecting from the inner walls of 
the sac were pieces of cartilage an inch in length  no signs of 
any testicular substance could be found anywhere The cord 
which was very thickened seemed to spread out over the sac 
just after its exit from the external ring The vessels from 
the cord surrounded the sac in a tortuous manner and were 
very large 
AfterHistoryThe patient made an uninterrupted re 
covery 
RemarksThis case seems of interest for the following 
reasons 1 That dermoid cysts in this region are very un 
common  2 that when they do occur an atrophied testicle 
or some remains of a testicle are generally to be found 3 
the fact that the patients father and the patients eldest son 
had a similar swelling  4 the difficulty of diagnosis

TWO CASES OF BULLET WOUNDS OF THE FEMORAL VESSELS IN 
hunters CANAL 
By Major S Hickson MB RAMC 
Case 1 Aneurysmal Varix 
J D a Boer prisoner of war aged about 40 was admitted on 
May 9th 1900 suffering from the effects of a bullet wound of 
the left thigh received at Rooidam on April 5th  range 
unknown The bullet was 
probably 
a LeeMetford and had 
entered the front of the thigh 4 inches above the patella 
passed upwards and backwards and emerged 3 inches below 
the gluteal fold The wounds were healed on his admission 
About 10 inches below Pouparts ligament in the line of the 
femoral vessels there was a rounded pulsating swelling 
4j inches in diameter  the pulsation 
was expansile and was 
accompanied by a very distinct thrill which could be traced 
upwards as far as Pouparts ligament and downwards to the 
popliteal space There was also a continuous rough murmur 
audible all along the course of the vessels an excellent 
example of the bee in a paper bag sound No oedema of 
leg 
The patient was unable to walk without the assistance of a 
thick stick  he complained of weakness in the limb and 
shooting pains down the inner side of the leg as far as the 
ankle The diagnosis of arteriovenous aneurysm was made 
TreatmentHe was placed on calcium chloride in full 
doses three times a day and kept at absolute rest in bed for 
three weeks without any effect afterwards instrumental 
compression of the femoral artery was given a trial but 
caused no improvement His heart and arteries being appa 
rently healthy it was decided to operate and on July 17th 
the vessels were exposed in Hunters canal by the usual in 
cision On drawing the artery to one side it was seen that a 
communication existed between it and the vein  the latter 
vessel was considerably enlarged and pulsated visibly but 
there was no proper sac The artery and vein were now sepa 
rately ligatured above and below the point of communication 
and about 1 inch of each vessel removed The incision was 
closed in the usual manner without any drain and the leg 
wrapped in cotton wool and elevated No ill effects followed 
the operation the wound healed rapidly there was neither 
loss of temperature in the limb nor oedema He was dis 
charged on September 22nd 1900 able to walk without a 
stick and apparently suffering no inconvenience 
Case 2 Traumatic Aneurysm 
Boer prisoner W P van A aged 32 admitted May 9th 
1900 for bullet wound of right thigh Like the previous case 
he was wounded at Rooidam on April 5th Projectile Lee 
Metford bullet  range unknown 
Condition on AdmissionThe entrance wound was in front 
of the thigh over the beginning of Hunters canal and the 
exit at a slightly lower level behind The thigh was very 
much swollen and a tense pulsating tumour existed in the 
region 
of the injury  the tumour was diffuse in character and 
painful pulsation ceased on compression of the main vessels 
at Pouparts ligament a rough systolic bruit was present 
No pulse could be felt below the level of the knee There 
was no oedema 
TreatmentThe tumour gradually increased in size and 
pain shooting down the leg became more constant On May 
12th an incision about 4 inches in length was made over the 
line of the artery in the upper portion of Hunters canal Be 
neath the fascia the intermuscular planes were found exten 
sively infiltrated with blood clot On the clot being cleared 
out and the femoral vessels exposed in the canal a punctured 
wound was found in the femoral artery the vein being un 
injured The artery was ligatured above and below the 
wound and divided between the ligatures the cavity irrigated 
with sterilised water and the wound closed There was 
never any loss of heat or oedema in the leg after the opera 
tion He made an excellent recovery and was allowed up 
on June ist and eventually handed over to the authorities as 
a prisoner of war

THE ALTRINCHAM HOSPITAL CHESHIRE 
successful removal of SPLENIC HJEMATOMA 
By E L Luckman MRCS LRCP Surgeon to the 
Hospital 
Mrs E aged 25 married about five months consulted me 
about her condition 
HistoryShe had been quite regular each month until after 
marriage About two and ahalf years previously whilst 
shaking some carpets she complained of pains in the left 
side below the ribs  and since then she had suffered great 
discomfort and noticed that side of the abdomen was in 
creasing in size Any exertion proved troublesome she 
suffered from indigestion and constipation 
State on ExaminationThe patient was cheerful in dis 
position of pale complexion height about 4 feet 11 inches 
Examination of the abdomen showed a large tumour filling 
the whole of the left side and extending to the right of and 
below the umbilicus There was dulness on percussion in 
the left lumbar region The surface was smooth slightly 
notched at its lower part and in the umbilical region felt like 
a cyst on digital compression 
Operation August 2nd 1900After the usual aseptic 
ablution of the abdomen Dr J Maclaren administered the 
anaesthetic Assisted by Messrs W O Jones Golland and 
Ransome I opened the abdomen making an incision four 
inches long in the middle line below the umbilicus The 
tumour was easily pushed into view a patch on its surface 
about two inches in diameter had a greenish appearance and 
was somewhat tough It was surrounded by a fringe of 
peritoneum I inserted my fingers and gradually separated 
this from the splenic tumour which was then free with the 
exception of its attachment to the pancreas and the vessels 
entering the spleen The cyst was aspirated and forty ounces 
of a sanguineous fluid withdrawn The spleen was next care 
fully drawn through the abdominal incision and a silk cord 
ligature tied firmly round the short pedicle embracing the 
splenic artery vein lymphatics and a little of the tail of the 
pancreas and divided The cut end of the pedicle was care 
lully examined for any oozing 
The abdomen was flushed with a warm saturated solution 
of boracic acid until there was little or no discoloration of 
the fluid The pedicle appearing satisfactory was returned 
to the abdomen The wound was closed by ten silk sutures 
through 
the peritoneum abdominal muscles and skin dusted 
with iodoform and boracic acid over which was placed a pad 
of iodoform gauze salembroth wool strapped and bandaged 
Time occupied operation and dressing 
an hour and a half 
AfterHistoryThe patient had a little vomiting after the 
operation 
which was easily controlled She passed a good 
night The wound was dressed on the fifth day and the 
sutures removed on the eighth The patient made an un 
interrupted recovery and left the hospital 
in five weeks She 
quickened ten days after the 
operation 
and on December 
28th 1900 was safely delivered of a male child iolbs in 
weight the patient herself weighing less than 120 lbs Since 
the operation her health has been remarkably good with the 
exception of the last two months of pregnancy when she had 
purpura of the upper and lower extremities which passed 
away soon after the birth of the child 
The spleen was partly solid and partly cystic 
Dr Coutts 
of Owens College kindly examined the fluid which was dark 
brownish red in colour specific gravity about 1030 contained 
large amount of albumen many blood corpuscles and a large 
number of cholesterine crystals 
The tumour six months after operation after it had been 
kept in spirit weighed 12 ozs Blood eight months after 
operation haemoglobin 62 per cent
