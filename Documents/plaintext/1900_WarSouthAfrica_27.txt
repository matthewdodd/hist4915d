THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE ORANGE RIVER 
By G H MAKINS FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force in South Africa 
WE are indebted to Mr Makins for the following interesting 
letter 
Orange River December 3rd 1899 
THE WOUNDED FROM THE MODDER RiVER 
A short note from the seat of war may be of interest to your 
ireaders After a three days stay at Capetown during which 
opportunity occurred of seeing the patients in the base hos 
pital at Wynberg brought from Natal SurgeonGeneral Wil 
son kindly brought me up to this field hospital and during an 
eight days stay some 6oo wounded men have passed through 
the hands of the RAMC here An immense amount of 
work has been done by these field hospitals under Majors 
Murray Birch Coutts and Knaggs in one night alone 300 
patients arrived from the fight at Modder River Thesl hos 
pitals are really acting for the present as stationary hos 
pitals since all the wounded have received their  firstaid  
dressing and been passed through the field hospitals at the 
immediate front The work is performed under some difficul 
ties as it is very hot and dusty on the veld Yesterday for 
instance the thermometer registered 1I50 F in some of the 
tents Fortunately the patients are able to be removed every 
few days to the base by means of two excellent hospital trains 
which have been improvised from the ordinary railway stock 
by the RAMC The fact that the journey fror hiere to the 
base hospital at Wynberg takes 28 hours emphasises the 
difficulties due to the immense length of the line of communi 
cation 
BULLET WOUNDS 
Your readers are no doubt by this time in possession of 
some information as to the cases at present at Wynberg so I 
shall confine myself to a short account of what I have seen in 
this camp I may say at once that the immense majority of 
the wounds have been inflicted by the Mauser or LeeMetford 
bullets and a small proportion by Martini bullets and large 
projectiles I shall refer to the wounds by the small calibre 
bullets only 
The Mauser and LeeMefford 
A wounded Boer referred to the LeeMetford as a  gentle 
manly bullet and this remark is equally applicable to 
the Mauser The wounds made by them are small 
clean and little disposed to suppurate and the tendency 
to suppuration is no doubt decreased by the excellent physical 
condition of the patients and the healthiness of the district 
Shock as a sign has been conspicuous by its absence even in 
the most serious cases and gives little or no aid in the 
diagnosis of visceral injury Retained bullets are compara 
tively uncommon no doubt on account of the fact that most 
of the men have been wounded in rapid advances The 
bullets met with have been little deformed unless they have 
struck stones before entering and I have seen no single 
instance which would suggest the use of either flattened or 
socalled explosive bullets among the wounded here The only 
large exit wounds have been one or two opposite comminuted 
fractures 
Wounds of Vessels 
Wounds of the soft parts are as a rule simple tracks with 
but little difference between the aperture of entry and exit 
such wounds heal in a few days with no surrounding indura 
tion or cedema In cases where vessels of any size are impli 
cated especially in such regions as beneath the deltoid 
gluteus maximus or the two layers of the calf considerable 
deep hwemorrhages often occur and are rapidly absorbed 
but free hmemorrhage from the wound itself is rare 
Wounds of great vessels naturally have not come under our 
observation in any number but one patient died in a few 
seconds soon after admission with sudden swelling of the 
belly another had a swelling some dulness and a thrill 
over the area of the innominate artery and one case of fractured 
femur had apparently an injury to the femoral vein This 
may I think be considered a very small proportion out of the 
total number of cases 
Wounds oJ Nerves 
Wounds of individual nerves will I think be a great feature 
of the campaign Wounds of the median ulnar musculo 
spiral alone or in various combinations are common I have 
seen two isolated injuries to the great Eciatic and one of the 
spinal acceseory nerve In some cases the evidence is in 
favour of complete section in others diminution of power 
combined with great hypersesthesia suggests contusion or 
partial laceration 
Fractures and Wounds of Joints 
Fractures are for the most part transverse or the bones are 
tunnelled with a simple track Comminution in the series 
seen here is distinctly rare either in the flat or long bones 
and certainly a lar2e number of the wounds have been inflicted 
well within the i ooo yards range 
Joint perforations especially of the knee are fairly common 
The cases left us too soon to form any opinion as to their per 
manent results but everything pointed to these concurring 
with those to be seen at Wynberg where little functional or 
structural alteration is to be observed 
Wounds of the Head 
The proportion of wounds of the head is small some 
fractures with much bursting at the wound of exit have been 
met with naturally many may have been left on the field 
and I think only some three or four have come down here 
Many extraordinary cases will no doubt be recorded thus for 
example entry in the median line below the chin perfora 
tion of the floor of the mouth and tongue the alveolar 
process of the superior maxilla traverse of the floor of the 
orbit injury to the back of the globe perforation of the anterior 
fossa and escape through the frontal bone at the margin of 
the hairy scalp The patient thus wounded left here on the 
fourth day without any symptoms Several others of a similar 
but slightly less complicated nature have been seen 
Wounds of the Neck 
Wounds of the neck have been very common but we have 
seen noile implicating the great vessels excepting the one 
already referred to A number of wounds of the posterior 
triangle with mixed nerve injuries are however under treat 
ment 
The small bullet Effects the most complete transverse sec 
tion of the spinal cord No fewer than io cases of paraplegia 
have come down from the front usually complete symmetri 
cal and with total absence of patellar reflex Time only will 
show how complete these injuries are but one from Belmont 
died here on the fourth day the remainder from Modder 
River have gone down to Wynberg 
Perforating Wounds of the Chest 
Perforating wounds of the chest have been numerous pro 
ducing remarkably slight symptoms Hremoptysis slight in 
degree persisting one to three days occurs in onethird of the 
cases a few have signs of blood in the pleura and a few have 
cellular emphysema The only constant sign is a want of 
respiratory mobility on the injured side and some diminution 
of breath sounds 
Wounds of the Abdomen 
I have seen fourteen wounds of the abdomen of these ten 
have exhibited no serious symptoms and will probably all 
get well The pulses have not risen above 8o and the only 
signs have been some local tenderness rigidity and deficient 
mobility of the belly all came here on the third day after the 
injury slight vomiting occurred in some of them before 
arrival In two cases the injury probably implicated the 
kidney and in one the liver but in all three the hremorrhage 
must have been very slight 
Albdominal ctions 
In four instances peritoneal infection had already occurred 
three of the patients being Boers and one an English officer 
The latter had suffered an injury to the ceecum abdominal 
section was done on the third day and he is doing well at the 
end of the week but still with a discharging wound abdo 
minal section was also done for a partly intraperitoneal partly 
retroperitoneal injury to ascending colon retrocolic extrava 
sation and emphysema had already occurred The wound was 
found and the affected area drained the patient is still living 
eighth day but will certainly succumb to seps s from the

1899 
large foul cavity in his loin The remaining two were cases 
of injury to the small intestine One was tco ill for operation 
The second was opened and three perforations in the jejunum 
were discovered and sutured Purulent inflammation had 
however already spread as low as the pelvis and the patient 
died the day following the operation All that can be said 
from this experience is that no patient should be operated 
upon from the mere fact of apparent traverse of the belly by a 
Mauser or LeeMetford bullet It is possible that if the 
patients could have been seen sooner operation might 
have been earlier decided upon in the four cases who were so 
treated but the great number of wounded at the front 
rendered this an impossibility 
OPERATIONS AT THE FIELD HoS PITALS 
Operations at the field hospitals have been very few in 
number I think at the most six amputations have gone 
down to Wynberg and there can be little doubt that such 
operations will be comparatively infrequent in this series of 
cases The cases as a whole started remarkably well 
There has been no serious wound infection up to the present 
a great tribuite to the care with which the dressings have been 
applied in the lhospitals and on the field by the hardworked 
officers of the RAMC In this camp during the last week 
on several occasions the officers were up all night or went to 
bed at 12 to rise at 4 AMu The heat durixng the day has been 
very great io8 to I15 F in thebell tents il the afternoons of 
the last few days 
From Our Special Correspondent In Capetown 
December 6th 1899 
ARRIVAL OF LORD METHUENS WOUNDED 
SINCE the series of battles north of the Orange River a very 
large number of wounded have come down and the RAM 
has plenty of work on its hands I can confirm my previous 
remarks that it is rising to the occasion most creditably 
No I General Hospital has now 574 beds occupied No 2 
Hospital has been established as I mentioned was to be the 
case on adjoining ground at Wynberg It has about ioo beds 
in occupation Almost all the cases are surgical and the 
distinction between the medical and surgical divisions in 
No I has so far as the class of case is concerned been prac 
tically abolished 
WOUNDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY 
Wounds of the extremitiesespecially the upper part of the 
lower extremitycontinue to be mueb in evidence and the 
vast majority of injuries are from rifle bullets The few Ehell 
cases appear merely to be from small fragments and are of a 
very unimportant nature One new feature is appearing in 
the cases from the First Divisiona considerable proportion 
of compound fractures of the thigh due no doubt to a certain 
number of the Free Staters who are operating in the North 
using rifles other than the Mauser Tlise fractures have 
not done as well as one would have lik ed though perhaps 
quite as well as could have been expected several have had 
to be followed by amputation and were eptic on arrival and 
death has been the result of a somewhat large proportion 
The rule appears to be to send the compound fractures to the 
base in preference to amputating in the field or at the 
stationary ho3pitals The former would have been manifebtly 
impossible in view of the rapid woveaieents of Lord Methuens 
force 
ABDOMINAL NVOUNDS 
Except as regards these compound fractures and that 
despair of military surgery the perforating abdominal wound 
the results continue to be remarkably good One case of the 
latter class I saw however whieh is doing admirably A 
Mauser bullet had entered on the left side just above the 
pelvic brim and had emerged on the opioosite side by way of 
a hole in the ileum itself lt had evidently pprforated the 
posterior wall of the bladder and established a communica 
tion between that viscus and the rectum for the muan was 
and still is passing all his urine per rectum Very little 
extravasation could have taken place before the securing of 
the fistulous communication although the patient had pretty 
severe peritonitis This has now subsided and the patient is 
doing splendidly Mr Treves saw him and advised that no 
operation should be undertaken 
HEAD INJURI ES 
The head injuries have done on the whole very well I 
saw one very successful case The bullet hacd entered the 
cranium near the middle line and had splintered the bone in 
a depressed gutter down along the course of the upper part of 
the Rolandic fissure One of the civilian surgeons trephined 
and removed a large number of spicules and small plates of 
bone The patient hd typical Jacksonian convulsions before 
operation and for tw days later but for four days these have 
ceased his temperature has gone down to normal and le is 
doing very well He is somewhat dull but has never been 
aphasic Another patient who was trephined in the occipital 
region has done very well no symptoms remaining except 
some photophobia 
WOUND OF THF SPINE 
Another case presents some features of interest A bullet 
had entered almost exactly in the midspinal line at the 
level of the sixth cervical vertebra abd had travelled down 
wards the man being lying down at the time and lodged at 
the level of the seventh dorsal whence it was removed The 
lower extremities are paralysed there is overflow dribbling 
from the bladder and total aneesthesiaas high as the fifth rib 
with a zone of hyperaesthesia above This zone is now about 
two fingers breadth and the hyporresthesia is not nearly so 
intense as before When the case fisEt came in the byper 
resthetic tract was very much wider no expansion of the 
anresthesia has so occurred no depression can be discovered 
He is being treated expectantly with an idea of possibly 
doing a laminctomy later 
THE RED CROSS 
The Red Cross people are doing good work a continuoua 
supply of comforts finding their way to thehospitals Colonel 
Young has left for the north Several local societies have 
been established under his control and at the intermediate 
stations some of them are doing gooi work in suppying afew 
extras to the men in transit The Relief Committee for men 
has engaged the services of a paid medical officer Dr Duthie 
The Women and Childrens Committee still gets on very well 
with voluntary medical aid 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNEiR 
VI 
THE AFRICAN SUINVAIER 
THE summer is now well advanced in South Africa and severat 
despatches complain of the intense heat The two most trying 
monthsJanuary and Februaryhave yet to come It ia 
during the summer especially the later summer months that 
typhoid fever and dysentety are most rife in all South African 
towns Sir George Whites report of ecember i8th will there 
fore cause little surprise to anyone acquainted with the 
country He says they have in Ladysmith 65 men  seriously 
afflicted by enteric fever and dysentery but this is not a 
very large proportion in a garrison of 90ooo It is no greater 
than usually obtains at this time of the year among the miners 
along the line of reef at Johannesburg The sanitary system 
in both cases is probably principally to blame The latrine 
and pail systems are when accompanied hv a free and 
thorough uee of dry earth theoretically perfect but in practice 
a certain amount of nuisance and sickness invariably appear 
to arise in connection with them during the hot summpr 
months The garrison at Ladysmith ig not confined within 
particularly narrow limits and in all probability their sanitary 
arrangements are about as good now as they would be in times 
of peace At the same time it must be borne in mind that 
the majority of our troops are at the mast susceptible age and 
that newcomers to the country always appear more liable to 
atack than older residenti It will be interesting to learn 
what proportion if aDy of the men affected withi typhoid were 
injected with antityphoid serum 
THE WOUNDED 
The wounded in Ladysmith are reported by Sir G White 
to be all doing well while we are informed that of the men 
wounded in Lord Methuens various engagements no fewer 
than a third have already recovered This is cheering news 
to friends of the wounded and the interesting letters from 
your correspondent at Capetown further show bow very

quickly and completely many of the Mauser bullet wounds 
heal 
THE SICK AND WOUNDED BEING SENT HOME 
A letter from Mr George Stoker questioning the wisdom of 
sending sick and wounded soldiers home appeared in the 
Times of December 22nd Mr Stoker has shown great 
practical interest in this question and was the chief organiser 
of the Portland Field Hospital which sailed for South Africa 
n December 13th under charge of a staff appointed by the 
War Office It will be remembered that the War Office made 
their acceptance of the hospital conditional on its being put 
entirely on a military footing and under military control 
Mr Stoker says the difficulties to treatment in South Africa 
appear to be classified under three heads 
i Climate 2 Accommodation  Sentiment 
I As for climate I speak with a large experience of the treatment of the 
sick and wounded in war in various climates and I venture to say that 
the climate of the uplands of South Africa whether in Natal the Trans 
vaal the Orange Free State or the old Colony is all that can be desired 
The Ulundi wounded were treated in Ladysmith and did splendidly 2 AccommodationThis 4s surely a matter of arrangement and in such 
a climate nothing can be better than a properly equipped marquee 
hospital betterI venture to thinkthan any improvised buildings 
whieh are seldom convenient and hardly ever sanitary better far than 
Netley Hospital where at this season especially there is little choice 
between foul air and freezing 
3 SentimentI think this consideration should not be allowed to 
interfere in preventing the best being done for the sick and wounded 
In conclusion let us not forget the great pain and discomfort to sick 
and wounded that long transport entails and anything that helps to 
avoid this must be an advantage 
Unfortunately the uplands of South Africa are at present 
more in the hands of the Boers than of ourselves although 
no doubt Estcourt and Maritzburg in Natal and say Beau 
fort West in the Karoo might be used for fiela hospitals 
But the fact is as I pointed out in a former letter there is 
ample demand in the present war for accommodation both in 
South Africa and in Engiand Probably only the severe cases 
with no prospect of recovery during the present campaign 
will be sent home and their desire would naturally be to be 
near their friends 
Mr Stokers reference to Netley is I think hardly fair The 
hospital is beautifully situated and appointed the wards are 
lofty airy and well warmed For the convalescents there is 
a reading room long covered glass corridors and magnificent 
grounds The British soldier need not complain if he never 
finds himself in worse qumters than Netley Hospital

Sir Redvers Buller Capain Hughes wan well known at 
Aldershot where he filled the post of Assistant Sanitary Officer 
for the last two years and where his zeal and scientific attain

tributed to raise the character and position of the corps in 
public estimation The officers will wear the usual mourning 
for one month from this date 
Colonel Hughes CB CMG of Guildford has received a 
telegram from General Sir Redvers Buller with reference to the 
death of his son Captain Matthew Louis Hughes at the battle 
of Colenso General Buller adds  We had all grown so fond 
of him 
PREPARATIONS AT HOME 
THE SICK AND WOUNDDED OFFICERS 
WE understand that a committee for the working of a Sick 
and Wounded Officers Surgical and Medical Aid Fund is in 
course of formation under the presidency of the Duke of 
Abercorn KG We understand that the purpose of the fund 
is to assist sick and wounded officers who on return from 
South Africa may stand in need of special or prolonged treat 
ment It is intended that careful inquiry should be made as 
to the pecuniary needs of such officers and a number of lead 
ing physicians and surgeons in London and the provinces 
have joined the Duke of Abercorns preliminary committee 
We believe that a meeting of the committee to consider the 
exact nature of the help needed and the mode in which it 
should be rendered will be held at an early date 
HOME HOSPITALS AND CONVALESCENT HOMES 
The committee of the Passmore Edwards Convalescent Home for Mem 
bers of Friendly Societies at Herne Bay has offered to the War Office the 
use of 20 beds in the institution for the occupation of soldiers who are 
invalided home from South Africa The only condition attached to the 
offer is that the men chosen must be members of friendly societies in ac 
cordance with the trust deed of the institution 
A large detached building capable of holding some 8o beds has been 
taken at Windsor as a convalescent home This establishment is to be 
called the South African Convalescent Home for woundedandin 
valided soldiers and sailors From this it is proposed to pass them on 
to the other branch of the home at WestgateonSea It is proposed also 
to establish another branch of the home at the Isle of Wight overlooking 
the Solent for the use of officers exclusively and to be called the 1 Con 
valescent Club where both paying and nonpaying patients will be re 
ceived 
Lord Dartmouth has arranged to receive 6 convalescent soldiers from 
the war at his country house iD 8taffordshire He appeals to others to 
find temporary homes for convalescent soldiers and is trying to organise 
a scheme with this object 
The Alexandra Hotel Woodhall Spa Lincolnshire has been offered for 
the use of invalid soldiers up to April 30th 
Soldiers invalided home will be able by the kindness of the Bath Cor 
poration to take thewaters free of charge and will be comfortably housed 
while they are undergoing the cure 
The Liverpool Royal Infirmary has informed the DirectorGeneral 
AMS that 22 beds will be held at the disposal for sick and wounded sol 
diers from South Africa who may belong to the Liverpool district 
The Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital has made a similar offer of 
20 beds 
COLONIAL OFFERS 
At Melbourne connectedwith the vigorous proceedings for the despatch 
of the new Victorian Force to South Africa and owing to the numbers of 
doctors and nurses who are volunteering the Government is considering 
the organisation of a small hospital corps The citizens of Perth Wet

MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS AITER TE TUGELA ACTION 
A Reuters telegram from Capetown states that Sir William MacCormac 
had said that all concerned with treating the wounded after the action at 
the Tugela deserve the fullest praise Trains full of wounded left the 
field at 2 in the afternoon for Estcourt and others followed promptly 
Eight hundred wounded passed through the hospital at Chieveley and 
the field was cleared of wounded by 5 oclock on the evening of the battle 
The Volunteer Ambulance Corps did splendid work and the Field 
Hospital completely and promptly met a great emergency It appears 
that many were taken on to Pietermaritzburg and some straight to the 
hospital ship at Durban which was to convey them to Capetown In com 
menting on this a correspondentwho is honoured by the largest print of 
the Times says It is satisfactory to record such a splendid performance 
At a time when criticisms of everything and everybody are flying about 
the admirable organisation of the Medical Department and the perfect 
smoothness of its working deserve the fullest recognition It is usually 
that part of an army which breaks down first and is least adequate in 
the present campaign it has so far proved entirely equal to ali require 
ments 
AuXILIARY BASE HOSPITAL AT PIETERSMARITZBURG 
We learn that LieutenantColonel F W L Hodder MB 
a retired officer of the Royal Army Medical Corps resident at 
Durban who placed his services at the disposal of 
the Principal Medical Officer has been appointed to the 
charge of the Auxiliary Base Hospital at Pietermaritzburg 
A staff of civil medical men and nurses male and female 
and a detachment of the RAMC noncommissioned 
officers and men have been attached to this hospital into 
which the Natal Volunteers of various corps will be received 
as well as soldiers of the regular forces The splendid 
loyalty and courage of the Colonial volunteers many of whom 
left their homes within an hours notice has excited the 
admiration of their comrades in the regular army They are 
described as a grand force but have unfortunately suffered 
severely from wounds and hardships 
LITERARY NOTES 
THERE is a legend that the heart of the great Napoleon hav 
ing been left unprotected after the postmortem examination 
wasdevoured by rats and that the doctors replaced the 
missing organ with a substitute taken from a sheep A cor 
respondent of the Philadelphia Medical Journal however 
quotes the following passage from Campbells Foreign Maga 
zine vol v I844 in which a different account of the matter is 
given 
When Bonaparte died it is well known that his heart was extracted 
with the design of being preserved The physician who had charge of it 
deposited it in a silver basin in water and retired to rest He felt so 
nervously anxious as the custodian of such a deposit that thouglh he re 
clined he did not sleep While lying thus awake he heard first a rustling 
noise then a plunge among the water in the basin and then the sound 
of an object falling with a rebound on the floor Dr A sprang from 
his bed and the cause of the intrusion on his repose was soon explained 
it was an enormous rat dragging the heart to its hole A few moments 
more and that which before had been too vast in its ambition to be satis 
fled with the sovereignty of Continental Europe would have been found 
even in a more degrading position than the dust of COsar stopping a beer 
barrelit would have been devoured as the supper of a rat 
Dr Barclay Smith of Cambridge has called our attention to 
the fact that Joubert and Krugernames of ill omen to us at 
the present momentmay both be found in medical litera 
ture Laurence Jouberts span of life extended from 1529 to 
1583 There is a grim coincidence in the fact that one of his 
works is a treatise on gunshot wounds and another deals with 
the treatment of wounds He also wrote on plague quartan 
fever paralysis popular errors in regard to medicine and was 
a reformer of French spelling Joubert entered the Univer 
sity of Montpellier at the age of 21I and lodged with 
one of the professors named Rondelet Rondelet was so 
struck with Jouberts zeal and assiduity that he offered him 
one of his daughters in marriage Rondelet had two 
daughters the elder one was very fat while the younger one 
had a most becoming figure It was the elder one that Rondelet 
suggested should become Jouberts wife Joubert however 
was not so eager to accept this proposal as he might 
have been He refused her He had cast loving eyes upon 
the younger one though he had not sufficient courage to make 
his feelings known No marriage resulted  because as M 
Astruc the historian remarks  The elder daughter did not 
please Joubert while Joubert soon realised that he did not 
please the younger Bartholdus Kruger was the author of a 
treatise on anatomy entitled Anatomtcus Curiosus 0Eo85LaaLTOS 
Hoc est Methodus Secundi Cadavera Hippocratica Democritva 
which was published at Brunswick in 17c0 Several  Krigers
