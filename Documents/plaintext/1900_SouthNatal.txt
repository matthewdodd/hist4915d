of the minor difficulties which attend transport in a country 
where every stream is as it were sunk in a deep trench with 
precipitous sides 
On January i8th the hospital moved on six miles to the 
Great Tugela and the tents were pitched under Mount Alice 
where the big naval guns were placed not far from Spear 
mans Hill On January 23rd the day before Spion Krp 
orders were suddenly received to increase the hospital by ioo

Soo altogether although no increase of the staff was possible 
The tents were ready however by the next day and on 
January 25th the wounded began to pour in until late at 
night carried by the Volunteer Ambulance Corps organised 
by Colonel Galwey and the coolie bearers Some 300 
wounded were at once sent on the 25 miles to Frere but the 
hospital that night contained some 6cc others Additionis later 
brought up the total which the hospital bad to accommodate 
to about 700 Altogether the hospital stayel three weeks at

the camp near Spearmarid Hill and dealt with over i ooo 
wounded in that time The army began to retire on Februatry 
8th and when on the next day the order came to the 
hospital to move there were still about 150 serious cases 
undter treatment These were all carried by hand on 
stretchers acrosis the veld 25 miles to the railway at Frere 
By transporting the woudnded in this way instead of in the 
ambulance waggons which are of a clumsy pattern made 
strong to go anywhere much suffering was prevented and in 
Mr Trevess opinion many lives and limbs saved 
At Frere wlhich was reached on February i ith the wounded 
were again placed in the hospital and as soon as possible 
moved on by train to Mooi River Base Hospital or 
to the hospital ships at Durban These trains were 
improvised by Major BrazierCreagh RAMC who did 
wonders with the material at his disposal Unfortunately 
the carriages had no through communication and it was 
difficult to arrange their conversion However by hard 
work and the expenditure of much energy and ingenuity 
Major BrazierCreagh overcame all superable obstacles and 
made the best of insuperable defects Fig 2 iS from Mr 
Trevess photograph of one of these trains and shows the 
bearers at work getting the wounded into the carriages 
Through the windows the white bed linen of the upper tier of 
beds can be seen It was part of the general unpreparedness 
that there were no hospital trains in Natal This defect has 
recently been repaired by the arrival of the Princess Christian 
Hospital train built for the Red Cross at Birmingbam and 
despatched to South Africa after the battle of Colenso was 
foughtnot a conspicuous example of the alleged superiority 
of voluntary effort over official methods The War Office has 
no train ready and does not prepare one the Red Cross has 
no train built but does set to work to build one one for three 
armies resting on three different lines of railway and man 
ages to get to work six months or thereabouts after the be 
ginning of the fighting 
WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE 
FROM AN OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
THE FIGHT INTO LADYSMITH 
To appreciate fully the magnitude of the task accomplished 
by the troops under Sir Redvers Buller one must bave seen 
the district around Colenso Opposite this village the Tugela 
is a broad and rapid river with steep and rugged banks 
which changes its course continually For months past it 
has been unfordable and the only bridges crossing it had 
been destroyed by the Boers On either side of the river are 
irregular ranges of hills which are divided by deep ravines 
into innumerable kopjes of every conceivable shape These 
vary in height from soo tO 2000 feet above the surrounding 
plain Many of them are almost perpendicular and 
most of them are thickly covered by dense mimosa 
scrub and huge boulders so that an army corps 
could be hidden amongst them without a man being 
visible Each kopje bristled with strong and deep 
trenches so skilfully constructed that as each one was 
captured it was exposed to a withering fire from all sides 
To add to our difficulties the plain between Colenso and 
Ladysmith is studded with kopjes which completely com 
mand both the road and the railway The seeming impossi 
bility of the task might well have caused even the bravest 
troops to hesitate and it was only after four stubborn attacks 
which extended over a period of 28 days hard fighting that 
the position was finally carried 
The strain which this entailed on our troops can only be 
realised by those who were present Imagine an attack 
which lasted continuously for x7 days as did the final one on 
the Boer position During the whole of that time the troops 
slept on the hillsides amidst thunder storms and rain with 
not even a great coat to cover them No words can do justice 
to their courage heroism fortitude and cheerfulness under 
all the hardships and privations to which they were exposed 
Ladysmith the goal of all our hopes during so many long 
and weary days may be described as a town in corrugated 
zinc situated in an oasis of palms and eucalyptus trees 
Stretching away to eastward of the town is a large circular 
plain some six miles in diameter On the southeast margin 
of theplainrises UmbulwanaHill Exceptto eastwardthetown 
is surrounded by barren stoneclad hills prominent amongst 
them being the famous Wagon Hill with Casars Camp 
to the south Whilst wandering through Ladysmith one is 
forcibly struck by its wonderful state of preservation An 
angle knocked off the clock tower of the Town Hall another off 
the porch of the Roman Catholic chapel and an occasional 
circular hole through some stray house is all that remains to

WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE 
tell of the fierce and longcontinued siege and bombardment 
which it so successfully resisted Amongst the troops and 
i9habitants however languid movements and pale and 
haggard faces showed clearly the effect of restricted 
rations and days and nights of broken rest Considering 
the number of men and animals that were shut up in 
the town for four long months its sanitary condition is 
marvellous Noxious smells are absent and our entrance 
intoLadysmithwas attended by an almost complete relief 
from the swarms of flies which plagued us at Colenso The 
health of the garrison has naturally suffered much At the 
time of the relief there were considerably over 2000 sick and 
wounded in hospital 8oo it was said were suffering from en 
teric fever It is currently rumoured that the Principal 
Medical Officer Colonel T J Gallwey CB is making 
arrangements to send as manyof the Ladysmith sick as possible 
to Durban where they will be placed on board hospital 
ships and sent for a sea voyage 
MIEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS 
As the relief column advanced against the hills south of the 
Tugela the field hospitals were steadily pushed forward from 
Chieveley until they rested on the south slopes of Monte 
Cristo and Hlangwana Hills On February 21st the 5th 
Irish Brigade captured Colenso The same evening the 
brigade crossed the Tugela and occupied the hills around Fort 
Wylie On February 22nd four field hospitals were moved 
across the pontoon bridge which had just been constructed 
and encamped on a large plain east of Fort Wylie on the 
north side of the river Whilst in this position the hospitals 
were vigorously shelled by the Boers especially those under 
LieutenantColonel G T Gaggin Major N R Cree and Major 
G H Younge 
As the troops worked round the Boer left flank it was found 
impossible to send the wounded back in the direction of Fort 
Wylie as the greater part of the road was exposed to the 
eaemys fire The hospitals were therefore ordered to recross 
the Tugela and to advance along its south bank in the direc 
tion of Ladysmith 
The evacuation of the field hospitals is unfortunately be 
c6ming increasingly difficult owing to the hospitals at the 
base and on the lines of communication being blocked with 
sick and wounded 
THE RED CROSS 
Namerous complaints have from time to time appeared as 
to the Boera failing to recognise the Red Cross For instance 
the field hospitals were repeatedly shelled at Spion Kop 
at Vaal Krantz and again at Fort Wylie I do not believe 
for a moment however that this was done intentionally It 
must be remembered that the Boer guns were firing at ranges 
varying from 6 to 8 miles or even more and at these 
distances it would be manifestly impossible to see the 
Red Cross flag The hospital tents being the most conspicuous 
objects in the field naturally attracted the enemys fire In 
fditure campaigns however it would be well if all tents and 
ambulances were khakicoloured These would be practically 
invisible at long ranges and would in every way be a very 
great improvement on the present lightcoloured tents and 
amibulances 
LYDDITE 
During the actions around Colenso we had many oppor 
tunities of studying the effects of lyddite amongst Boer pri 
sonerswho were broughtin wounded Some of the wounds were 
quite ghastly In one prisoner admitted into the 5th Brigade 
Field Hospital a fragment of shell had carried away the 
upper part of the sternum several of the upper ribs and the 
greater part of the adjoining shoulder leaving the lung 
exposed to view Part of the same shell had smashed the 
right femur and opened the kneejoint The patient was 
however progressing favourably when he left for the base 
The exposed parts of the skin of many of the prisoners was 
stained of a bright yellow colour by the lyddite fumes and 
washing had no apparent effect on the discoloration 
DRY ANTISEPTIc DRESSINGS 
The dislike not to say suspicion which both officers 
aid men entertain towards dry antiseptic dressings is very 
ramarkable This arises in part from a desire to have 
the wounds exposed daily so that they may see how 
they are progressing and in part from an inability 
to understand the advantages of antiseptic surgery 
Wounded men will adopt almost any device such for 
instance as deliberately soiling the bandages to ensure a 
change of dressing If the dressings are not changed daily 
many of them believe that they are being grossly neglected 
The advantages of dry antiseptic dressings have however 
been clearly demonstrated during the presentcampaign and it 
is certainly time that the army generally grasped the prin 
ciple which underlies them 
BOER AMMUNITION 
At the battle of Colenso the bullet wounds were without 
exception caused by ordinary Mauser bullets Not a wound 
was seen which even remotely suggested an expanding bullet 
At Spion Kop however several of the woundb showed that 
expanding bullets had been used When the Boer position at 
Monte Cristo was captured quantities of their ammunition 
fell into our hands Amongst this were found MartiniHenry 
Mannlicher sporting LeeMetford sporting soft nosed and 
Jeffreys sporting cartridges The latter are especially destruc 
tive The tip of the envelope is removed and the nickel 
coating is scored longitudinally at four points When it strikes 
a part of the bullet breaks and fattens out like a mushroom 
inflicting a truly ghastly wound 
NUMBERING OF FIELD HOSPITALS 
Before leaving England the field hospitals were numbered 
cousecutively from No I upwards without any reference to 
the brigade to which they belonged On taking the field it 
was found that this gave rise to constant mistakes and incon 
veniences Finally the number of the hospital was changed to 
correspond with that of the brigade to which it belonged as 
for instance the ist Brigade Field Hospitala change which 
greatly simplified matters This system should certainly be 
adopted in future campaigns as under it the number of the 
hospital at once denotes the brigade to which it belongs 
During the attack on Pieters Hill it was rumoured that 
Captain J H Campbell RAMC attached to the Kings 
Royal Rifles had been reoommended for the Victoria Cross 
Captain Oampbell was informed that some men of the regi 
ment lay wounded on a kopje about 400 yards away He walked 
to the kopje through a fire which was so fierce that he was 
almost hidden by the dust which was raised by the bullets 
Strange to say he escaped without a scratch but was wounded 
a day or two later whilst on duty with the regiment 
CHARGES AGAINST HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT 
Since writing the above I have learnt from the BRITISH 
MEDICAL JouRNAL of February ioth that certain charges of 
defective management have been brought against some at 
least of the hospitals in South Africa These charges have 
been officially contradicted by both Lord Roberts and Sir 
Redvers Buller How easily charges of this kind may origi 
nate is shown by an incident which occurred after the battle of 
Colenso Two wounded men complained to their commanding 
officer whilst he was visiting the hospital that they had had 
nothing to eat for two days On inquiry it turned out that 
both the men were severely wounded and were for good 
reasons only allowed fluid nourishment An ample supply of 
milk and beeftea had been ordered for them and they ad 
mitted that they had received the whole of it As however 
they had not had solid food they complained that they had 
had nothing to eat 
THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF ALGIERsThe Annales de 
llnstitut Pasteur of March 2Sth contains a report by Dr 
Trolard Director of the Pasteur Institute of Algiers of the 
work done at that institution from November ist I894 when 
it was opened to December ist I898 Since its foundation 
the Institute has received I836 persons who had been bitten 
by rabid animals The animals which inflicted the bites 
were dogs in i669 cases cats in I30 asses in 9 jackals in 6
