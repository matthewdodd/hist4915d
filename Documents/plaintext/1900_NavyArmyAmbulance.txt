of affairs should no longer exist There ought to beand 
in the public interest this must be insisted ona health 
officer for the Clyde whose exclusive duty it shall be to 
deal with the shipping In the meantime the medical 
officers of health doing duty on shore along the Clyde 
banks have to inspect the shipping while some firms engage 
private medical practitioners to look after the health of 
their ships in the river This is not sufficient  and so urgent 
do we consider this matter that we hope before a week is 
over to see the omission remedied and to learn that a 
medical officer of health has been appointed to deal with 
the Clyde shipping not merely during the present 
emergency but permanently He will have plenty of 
work and the gain to the shipping community on the 
Clyde and to the country at large will amply repay the few 
hundred pounds expended upon so necessary an officer 
THE SECTION OF THE NAVY ARMY AND 
AMBULANCE 
The wide scope of this new Section is well shown in the 
proceedings which we publish in fall in this weeks issue 
of the British Medical Journal The papers read chiefly 
related to the army medical services but the navy came 
in for a share of attention while under the head of ambu 
lance were included problems connected with the sick and 
injured in civil life especially in our great towns 
It is hardly possible to urge too strongly on the atten 
tion of the War Office the importance of the papers con 
cerning the regular and auxiliary medical services con 
tributed as they are by officers of ripe experience and 
judgment and discussed by others possessing the same 
qualifications The discussions can hardly fail to ba of 
considerable assistance to those who may have to deal 
with the serious problem of the future reorganisation 
of these services which we trust will be taken in hand 
immediately after the termination of the Boer war We 
hope the scheme foreshadowed in the resolution following 
Mr Cantlies paper will be worked out without undue 
delay and placed in the hands of the Minister for War 
BrigadeSurgeonLieutenantColonel J E Squire grappled 
with the difficult problem how best to augment medical 
personnel in the field which of course hinges on the ques 
tion of reserves He condemned the handtomouth sys 
tem of mixing up untrained civil surgeons and ambulance 
men with the regular establishments on the eve of a war  
and insisted that all reserves of officers and nurses male 
and female should be taught in peace something of army 
organisation and methods and especially should learn the 
meaning of discipline He expressed a strong suspicion 
that inattention to these essentials in personnel has had 
much to do with the grounds on which the alleged failures 
and scandals in the South African military hospitals have 
been based Civil units in their proper place may be of 
great service but should not be recklessly mixed up with 
the regular army units 
BrigadeSurgeonLieutenantColonel Peter Giles ex 
pressed similar views in his scheme for the organisation of 
volunteer medical units He urged that a volunteer medical 
officer of sufficient rank should be attached to the office 
of the DirectorGeneral and under him should inspect and 
supervise the volunteer medical services 
In the discussion which followed this paper Mr 
Frederick Trves as the outcome of his experience during 
the war advocated that field hospitals should be larger 
units say 300 instead of 100 socalled beds  this would 
certainly facilitate their subdivision into more efficient 
sections when necessary He mentioned that the military 
and civil surgeons at the theatre of war worked together 
in great harmony owing largely to the liberal and unselfish 
way in which the former treated the latter this testimony is 
all the more welcome considering there have been attempts 
by the enemies of the medical service to sow discord between 
them The question of orderlies Mr Trves declared to be 
surrounded with almost incredible difficulty inasmuch as 
their duties do not only lie in nursing but in pitching and 
striking tents digging water trenches and in every way 
handling the impedimenta of the hospital he declared that 
female nurseswhose services otherwise are deeply appre 
ciatedcannot take the place of the male orderly in the 
field hospitals This will appear to be common sense to all 
who have any experience of military life or of war He 
recognised that the formation of a reserve of medical 
officers is full of difficulty  they must necessarily be young 
men for it is useless to expect medical men in settled 
practice to hold themselves available for war services 
Mr Cantlies paper on how to link the regular and 
auxiliary forces deserves special attention as coming from a 
man who is always thoroughly practical in his suggestions 
He would organise the militia and volunteer medical 
services on lines if not identical at all events parallel 
with those of the regular forces  and would link the three 
branches of the service together just as the several 
battalions of them are already linked in the Army List 
His views are likely to be largely embodied in the scheme 
which is being prepared for submission to the War Office 
BrigadeSurgeonLieutenantColonel G S Elliston in 
his remarks on volunteer brigade companies gave some 
interesting reminiscences of how the floating volunteer 
regimental medical atoms began to be drawn together into 
some sort of combination It is liable to be forgotten that 
their first cohesion was in the Volunteer Ambulance Asso 
ciation which some twoand twenty years ago originated 
in the enterprise of Major Maclure of the London Scottish 
who enlisted the aid and sympathies of such wellknown 
officers in the War Office as SurgeonGenerals Munro and 
Mackinnon and their two assistants SurgeonMajors Don 
and McNalty 
i The papers on how to adapt bearer companies and field 
hospitals so as to act with cavalry or other mounted troops 
bySurgeonMajorJFSCaverhillof the Lothian Yeomanry 
and SurgeonMajor V Matthews VMSC as well as that by 
SurgeonMajor FLStephensonVMSC on the use of the 
cycle in rendering first aid grapple with subjects of no 
little difficulty To enable the hospital service to keep up 
with rapidlymoving cavalry means that it must itself have 
powers of rapid locomotion it must be mounted or 
equipped with light carts on the whole the latter mode 
seems to commend itself most 
SurgeonGeneral J B Hamilton dealt trenchantly with 
the condition of the Royal Army Medical Corps and we 
commend his outspoken criticisms to the earnest attention 
I of those on whom will fall the work of reform 
I The other papers read in the Section are well worth

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION 
The medical profession has reason to be proud of the 
fact that two of its members have in successive years 
occupied the distinguished position of President of the 
British Association for the Advancement of Science 
The Association is also to be congratulated on having 
chosen two such representatives of medical science to 
preside over its meetings as Sir Michael Foster 
and Sir William Turner Sir William Turner was born 
at Lancaster in 1832 and received his medical education 
at St Bartholomews Hospital London where he had a 
distinguished career as a student He became a member 
of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1853 and 
four years later he took the degree of MB in the University of London At the age of 22 he was appointed Demon 
strator of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh and on 
the death of Professor John Goodsir in 1867 he succeeded 
to the chair Sir William Turners work as 
an anatomist has placed him in the front rank 
of workers in that branch of science The Transac 
tions of various learned societies contain many com 
munications from him and he was also a contributor 
to the reports of HMS Challenger He is one of 
the founders and editors of the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology He has been Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh and 
President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edin 
burgh In 1889 he was President of the Anthropological 
Section of the British Association In 1898 he was elected 
to the Presidency of the General Council of Medical Edu 
cation on which he had for many years previously repre 
sented the University of Edinburgh He was a member 
of the Royal Commission appointed in 1881 to in 
quire into the working of the Acts affecting the 
medical profession Honours have been showered 
upon him from many and diverse quarters The Neill 
medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh was awarded 
him for his contributions to Scottish natural history 
The Royal Irish Academy has conferred its honorary 
membership upon him and amongst other bodies which 
have bestowed a like distinction are the Anthropological 
Societies of Berlin Rome and Paris the Royal Medical 
and Chirurgical Society of London the Royal Academy of 
Science of Berlin the Literary and Philosophical Society of 
Manchester and the Obstetrical Societies of London and 
Edinburgh The Universities of Oxford Glasgow Dublin 
Montreal Toronto and Durham have conferred upon him honorary degrees and he has been elected 
a member of the Athenaeum Club under the rule 
allowing the Committee to elect men who have 
attained eminence in science literature the arts or 
public 
service In December 1898 on the occasion of the cele 
bration of the Jubilee of the St Petersburg Academy of 
Medicine Sir William Turner was made an honorary member of the Academy The honour of knighthood was 
conferred upon him in 1886 Sir William Turner is a 
DeputyLieutenant of the City and County of Edinburgh 
He has also shown a keen interest in the Volunteer 
movement He joined the force at its institution in 1859 
and for thirty years he held a commission in the Queens 
Rifle Volunteer Brigade Royal Scots retiring in 1889 with 
the rank of LieutenantColonel His presidential address 
delivered this week at Bradford an abstract of which 
appears at p 690 was worthy of the man and of the 
occasion

THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON 
The first meeting of the reconstituted Senate of the 
University is fixed for October 24th and the last day for 
sending in nominations to the Clerk of Convocation of 
candidates for the sixteen seats to be filled by election from 
that body is the 17th of this month It is anticipated that 
the election of the new Senate will be completed by 
October 12th but two more meetings of the old Senate will 
not improbably be summoned early next month to transact 
formal business Taere appears to be every prospect of a 
keen competition for the Convocation seats on the new 
Senate Two rival organisations are engaged in pressing the 
claims of their nominees The Association of University of 
London Graduates which was first in the field with a 
complete list of candidates in every faculty with the excep 
tion of that of music is now confronted by the Union of 
University of London Graduates which during the 
past week has put forward candidates in Law and 
Medicine Thus Mr Joseph Walton QC is to be opposed 
by Sir H H CozensHardy who preceded Mr Walton 
as Chairman of the General Council of the Bar and was be 
fore his elevation to the Bench the representative of North 
Norfolk in the Liberal and Radical interest Sir H H 
CozensHardy was also the active chairman of the committee 
of graduates who supported legislation in general accord 
ance with the report of the Gresham Commission In 
medicine Dr Ringer FRSand Mr A Q SilcockFRCS 
are to be opposed on behalf of the Union by Dr J F Payne 
BScLond MDOxon a member of the present Senate 
and Dr T Barlow BS BSc Dr Barlows candidature is 
interesting because he was a member of the Statutory Com 
mission which framed the new statutes for the government 
of the University Considerable discussion has already 
arisen and is likely to increase as the election 
approaches in reference to the proposal of the Commissioners 
to concentrate the preliminary and intermediate 
teaching hitherto carried on at each medical school 
In their final report the Commissioners stated that they 
had 
 
come to the conclusion that some kind of concentra 
tion is desirable7 and they only hesitated to frame a 
statute themselves for the immediate consummation of 
the end they so devoutly desired out of respect to the 
absence of 
 
such consensus of opinion in regard to the 
mode in which concentration should be carried out as 
would enable them to do it Representations made to the 
Commissioners on behalf of the metropolitan medical 
schools were sufficient to indicate that there are strong ob 
jections to such wholesale 
 
concentration 
 
as is fore 
shadowed by the Commissioners and graduates especially 
those connected with the teaching staffs of the London 
hospitals will do well to study this question attentively 
In the musical faculty it is possible that a harmonious 
arrangement may be arrived at and the handful of musical 
graduates may be spared the rancour of a contested elec 
tion Mr J W Sidebotham we understand commands 
the confidence of a majority of the musical graduates and 
as he regards the external work of the University as of 
vital importance and accepts the formula of the Associa 
tion as to keeping open to all comers on terms of equality 
aud impartiality all the degrees and distinctions of the 
University he is pretty sure of election
