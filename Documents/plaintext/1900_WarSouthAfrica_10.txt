THE MARCH TO THE TUGELA 
By FREDERICK TREVES FR CS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Forces 
Spearmans Hill January 19th 1900 
DYSENTERY AND ENTERIC FEVER 
AFTER the disastrous battle of Colenso on December isth 
1899 the field hospital to which I was attached returned to 
Frere Camp Sir Redvers Buller also returned to Frere 
and made that place once more his headquarters I have 
remained at Frere under canvas ever since The hospital 
was pitched in the same place and was cleared of all the 
wounded We soon became filled up with cases of 
dysentery and enteric fever The dysentery was of a 
severe type and we had several deaths One of my nurses 
Miss Tarr was I am sorry to say taken ill with dysentery 
and was at once removed to Maritzburg She developed 
the affection in a very acute form and at one time her life 
was despaired of She is now I hear doing well but will 
of course not be able to go to the front again 
TREATMENT OF DYSENTERY 
I might mention that the treatment of dysentery 
which is mostly followed at Maritzburgwhere there 
are now many casesis that by sulphate of magnesia 
The treatment is somewhat painful but such able practi 
xioners as Dr Scott of Maritzburg and Dr Brown of the 
Assembly Hospital are convinced of its great efficiency 
Another method of treatment in favour with many is that 
by perchloride of mercury with a little opium 
I have had an opportunity of seeing many cases of 
dysentery and my impression is that of the methods of 
treatment at present in vogue that by purgativessuch as 
sulphate of magnesiais the best Dr Brown under 
whose kind and skilful care my nurse was has quite con 
vinced himself of the value of the sulphate of magnesia 
mode of cure 
THE WOUNDED AT MARITZBURG 
ihring my stay at Frere I paid two visits to Marifzburg 
Ao see certain of the wounded One of these visits was in 
xesponse to a telegram from the War Office requesting me 
so see and report upon two wounded officers The cases 
from Colenso still lying at Maritzburgwere doing well and 
one was over and over again struck by the marvellous 
anatomical feats performed by the Mauser bullet Per 
haps the most remarkable cases are those in which a bullet 
has passed through the brain without causing more than 
trifling symptoms 
TRAUMATIC ANEURYSM 
The number of instances of traumatic aneurysm is also 
curious I have seen traumatic aneurysms of the brachial 
femoral popliteal and posterior tibial several varicose 
aneurysms of the thigb and an aneurysmal varix in 
Scarpas triangle 
ARTERIOVENOUS ANEURYSMS 
In one case there was a very large arteriovenous 
neurysm in Hunters canal with free communication 
with the vein and great swelling of the thigh The lesion 
was due to a Mauser bullet which had escaped At the 
invitation of the surgeon in charge I operated upon 
this case I placed a temporary ligature on the com 
mon femoral opened the sac dipcovered the holes in 
the artery and vein and ligatured the artery above and 
helow the wound and the vein on the proximal side only 
Before the incision was closed the temporary ligature was 
removed This case I am glad to say did well and when 
I saw the man again fourteen days after the operation he 
was well on the road to complete recovery 
THE HOSPITAL ARRANGEMENTS 
On Friday January 12th Sir Redvers Buller left Frere 
and on the following day the 13th we took our departure 
The movement was to be to Springfield some i8 miles 
from Frere In order to meet the demands of the position 
and the possibilities of a big battle on or near the Tugela 
Colonel Gallwey CB the Principal Medical Officer de 
cided to make No 4 Stationary Field Hospital to which 
I had been attached from the first a mobile hospital to 
follow the troops otherwise all the wounded would have 
to be carried back to Frere Colonel Gallwey also esta 
blished a general hospital at Mooi River with 5oo beds 
and these with the iioo beds available at Maritzburg and 
the few beds at Estcourt would do much to meet a very 
difficult medical position There can be no doubt that 
Colonel Gallweys arrangements were ably conceived and 
admirably carried out He certainly spared no trouble to 
make the Army Medical Department in Natal a complete 
success 
THE JOURNEY OF THE HOSPITAI 
Oar march was made on January 13th and an account 
of it will give some idea of the difficulties in the way of 
work at the front The hospital is to accommodate a 
minimum of 300 beds and was made up of 6o tents and I0 
marquees The rank and file of the RAMC numbered 
88 There were I 2 surgeons including myself 2 army 
sisters and my remaining nurse Miss McCaul We also 
took with us ioo coolies for camp work who walked all 
the way with their earthly possessions on their heads 
Our train was composed of i6 ox waggons each with i6 
oxen The water and bread carts were also drawn by 
oxen so that the number of oxen employed was over 260 
There were 5 ambulances each drawn by IO mules My 
own transport consisted of a small covered waggon a 
Scotch cart i6S mules a conductor on horseback 4 Kafflr 
 boys a groom and my manservant There were there 
fore 66 mules on the road I rode on horseback as did 
most of the other surgeons We got up at 3 AM the tents 
were all down by 4 AM and at 515 AM we left Frere It 
was a glorious day a little too hot for comfort and with a 
too blazing sun We outspanned for two hours at 730 AM 
and reached Springfield at 230 PM having done the whole 
march in two treks Considering the roads the size of the 
waggons the slowness of oxen and the heat this was con 
sidered a good march On nearing Springfield we had an 
escort and passed 4 Boer prisoners being marched to the 
base 
A VIEW OF THE BATTLEFIELD 
The camp at Springfield was a very charming one and 
the Lesser Tugela which is swift but muddy provided 
excellent bathing I rode each day to the hill command 
iog the Great Tugela upon which our big guns are placed 
The view from this hill is grand in the extreme It com 
manis a splendid plain covered with kopjes across which 
runs the Ladysmith road At the bottom of the hill 
which was rendered beautiful by mimosa trees in bloom 
was the drift The Boer trenches were well in view and 
until our guns began I could see the Boers working in 
their shirtsleeves at their allpervading earthworks 
On Thursdiy January i8th the hospital moved to the 
banks of the Great Tugela a distance of six miles I had 
an opportunity of seeing from the hill on which our guns 
were placed the many details connected with the crossing 
of the river the passing of our men across the drift 
and their hiding behind the nearest kopje the play of 
the howitzers and the field artillery the ascent of the 
balloon and the hundred and one incidents which attend 
a great military movement One could also watch 
Sir Charles Warrens advance on the left Over and 
ovEr again our shells burst right in the Boer trenches 
but only very rarely could any Boers be seen They

lay low with admirable patience I cannot imagine 
that the area of a great battlefield could be better viewed 
than from the hill on which we stood and which 
rose abruptly from the river bank The quietness of 
the place when the guns ceased was extreme and was 
broken only by the numerous doves which occupy the 
wood on the hill side The country although occupied by 
some thousands of Boers appeared to be absolutely 
deserted There was a suspiciously large number of Boer 
ambulances to be seen and I imagine that not a few of 
these ambulances were carrying ammunition and supplies 
The accuracy of our big gun firing was much to be ad 
mired and there was hardly a trench donga or copse 
which had not a shell dropped into it at some time I be 
lieve that some five miles of the Ladysmith road is in view 
from the hill The soldiers have been lying out without 
tents and on short rations but fortunately the weather has 
been fine It is difficult to give a proper impresaion of the 
immense tract of country to be covered and of the number 
and irregularity of the hills which have to be passed 
THE PROVISIONING OF THE FORCE 
The transport of rations fodder and ammunition for the 
large force employed must tax the Army Service Corps to 
the utmost but so far the difficulty has been well met 
Miles of waggons are to be met with along the road and 
many thousands of oxen are employed 
I shall hope to be able to give some account of the 
engagement which is impending At present we are wait 
ing ready to start at an hours notice and of the direction 
of our move we know nothing

HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
BULLET INJURIES OF THE HEAD 
A HUMANE WAR 
THE remark has already been frequently made that this is a 
very humane war It is to be hoped that such is really the 
ease As far as regards bullet wounds there is no doubt 
that the vast majority inflict as a rule little pain either at 
the time that the wound is received or subsequently Flesh 
wounds heal soundly in a few days The apertures of 
entrance and exit which are often scarcely to be distinguished 
from each other close up at once The track of the Mauser or 
the LeeEnfield bullet cicatrises rapidly into a tough cord 
most noticeable where muscle has been traversed Large 
extravasations are quickly absorbed and suppuration scarcely 
ever occurs A month or so after the injury the scars on the 
surface are often scarcely perceptible and when they are 
situated in a fold of the skin particularly about the face as 
for instance by the eyelids the closest inspection is neces 
sary to detect any mark at all The explanation of the 
gratifying absence of all untoward complications probably lies 
in the fact that in an ordinary wound resulting from a small 
bore nickelsheathed clean bullet little if any air is intro 
duced into the wound The wound is almost valvular and 
little more than is frequently made in subcutaneous surgery 
If the bullet passes through the ordinary helmet worn by the 
men it does not bore a hole clean through such as would be 
made by a drill The aperture will more probably consist of 
a semicircular cut through the material and the little 
tongue of material corresponding in diameter with that of the 
bullet is seen to be slightly depressed below the level of the 
cleancut portion 
Much the same sort of effect appears to be produced on the 
skin and possibly on deeper structures It is not difficult to 
understand therefore how large wounds that must have tra 
versed most important viscera heal readily In a subsequent 
letter I hope to mention cases where the lung or lungs have 
been perforated the abdominal cavity traversed or the liver 
shot through with little more than temporary trouble In the 
abdominal cases it is certainly still a question whether in 
the absence of positive indications exploratory laparotomy is 
advisable The opinion generally held now seems to be ad 
verse to operation But so large and impcrtatt a subject re 
quires to be dealt with fully and at present there is scarcely 
material enough to hand to justify any conclusions in the 
matter 
With head injuries however the case is different The 
large number already seen has probably led most of those who 
have had them under treatment or watched their progress 
generally to arrive at certain broad conclusions Perhaps no 
class of cases has shown more satisfactory results and the re 
coveries in many instances have been very remarkable In 
detailing some few instances that have come under notice I 
will confine myself chiefly to the clinical aspect of the cases 
and allow the records to speak for themselves The points 
already mentioned with regard to the behaviour of the bullet 
in traversing the soft parts such as the Ecalp must be borne in 
mind in considering injuries of the skull and its contents and 
it must also be remembered that we have no details of head 
injuries that were immediately fatal 
 GUTTER WOUNDS OF THE SKULL 
A considerable number of gutter wounds are seen Here 
the skull is grazed or troughed to a greater or less depth 
Even when a strip of scalp is destroyed the wound heals up 
very readily and when more or less circular apertures of 
entrance and exit are present the grooving of the bone may 
easily escape detection But these injuries are by no means 
unimportant Even when the skull is lightly touched there 
is likely to be very considerable fracture and splintering of 
the internal table When such cases have been trephined 
owing to cerebral symptoms the extent of underlying damage 
has usually excited astonishment There is little doubt in 
my mindand I believe the opinion will come to be shared 
by the surgeons at work in the military hospitalsthat 
every case of gutter woundof the skull should be trephined 
In head injuries it is necessary to look far ahead To con 
centrate the attention on the mere healing of the wound is to 
miss the cardinal importance of these cases Operation in tbese 
instances though it may seem unnecessary and though it 
must be in some degree exploratory is really most strongly 
indicated as a preventive measure We are all in civil hos 
pitals at home only too familiar with cases of old head injury 
in which mental symptoms have gradually developed and 
we would probably acknowledge if only to ourselves that 
belated surgical interference in such patients does not give 
very encouraging results Exploratory laparotomies are 
perpetually being performed in civil life often with very faint 
shadow of justification Exploratory trephinings are too 
often omitted simply because the symptoms which might 
indicate operation only slowly come on It is very far from 
my intention to criticise now in any way surgical practice 
here Operations for trephining here in this campaign have 
been so strikingly successful as I make no doubt whatever 
statistics will hereafter show that the surgeons show no 
reluctance to undertake them Nevertheless some gutter 
wounds are seen which have been left to themselves It is 
of course a class of injury very rarely met with in civil prac 
tice Possibly some of those wounded in this way have been 
sent back to the front as recovered It will be interertng in 
this case to note whether the men are easily affected by the 
sun for it must be a matter of common experience that for a 
long time after a head injury involving any damage to the 
encepbalon patients are peculiarly liable to ke so affected 
even in climates much more temperate than that of South 
Africa Possibly the high velocity of modern bullets ac 
counts for the damage to the internal tables of the skull 
The vibrations set up through the thickness of the skull by 
the passage of a MauEer bullet say partly through the ex 
ternal table must be enormously rapid and the mechanical 
explanation of the bone lesion is not far to seek 
PENETRATING WOUNDS OF THE HEAD 
Bullet wounds actually penetrating the skull and some 
portion of its contents are numerous enough and constitute 
at first sight the most remarkable cases met with in the 
military hospitals First with regard to the effects on the 
skull itself The range will as is well known and as has been 
determined experimentally greatly influence the amount of 
injury inflicted on the bone Unfortunately reliable informa 
tion can very seldom be obtained on this point All who have 


472 KmIS JmALj SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALS FEB 24 1900 
read the accounts of the engagements near the Modder River 
and at Colenso will recognise that the men can have had but 
a vague idea of the range at which they were hit At Colenso 
for instance scarcely a Boer was seen and there were tiers 
upon tiers of entrenched positions Usually the shortness of 
the range is much exaggerated 250 yards is a common 
estimate There is no doubt however that the Highland 
Brigade at Magersfontein were shot down at extremely close 
quarters Judging by the results of the experiments made 
with modern smallbore rifles in England and Germany the 
bulk of the head injuries seen in hospital have been inflicted 
at medium ranges say 400 to 8oo yards This is really what 
we should expect for at close quarters the amount of damage 
caused by a penetrating wound of the head is so extensive as 
to be probably fatal 
The more obliquelythe bullet enters the skull the greaterwill 
be the amount of damage totheinnertables If the apertures of 
exit and entrance are both at a right angle to the plane of the 
skull both wounds may seem to be cleanly drilled through the 
bone and are scarcely to be distinguished by external inspec 
tion But in all cases the inner table will be more or less 
broken up at the aperture of entrance and if the skull is 
trephined there will be no doubt whatever as to the direction 
of the wound Even in a long wound fragments of bone may 
be found lying along the greater part of the track In not a 
few instances where trephining has been done at the front a 
second operation has been found necessary at the base and 
much loose bone removed 
At very short ranges the skull may be burst open to a 
greater or less extent in the manner which has been shown 
experimentally to take place Thus in Colonel Stevensons 
work on Gzunshot Wounds a skull is figured into which a small 
bore bullet had been fired at a distance of few yards I have 
not the work by me for reference but believe the distance 
was ten yards The skull is seen to be most extensively frac 
tured The specimen is in the Museum at Netley to the best 
of my recollection 
The observations made above relate to the calvarium and 
instances may now be cited bearing out the foregoing remarks 
I have to thank the surgeons for permission to give the fol 
lowing sketches of the cases under their charge Frequently 
the patients as they are moved from field to base hospital or 
on to hospital ships have been under the care of several 
surgeons and it is impossible to communicate with all More 
over oftentoo often indeedthe patients are shifted about 
in the base hospitals and it is far from easy to follow out a 
particular case without giving much trouble to the much over 
worked administrative staff The followirg are examples of 
injury at close range 
Private D wounded at Modder River on December ioth 
I899 Entrance wound 2 inches behind right parietal 
eminence in a line drawn between that eminence and occi 
pital protuberance Exit through frontal bone in right side 
close to longitudinal sinus The bullet traversed at least 
6 inches of brain tissue The left arm was completely and 
the left leg partially paralysed There was evidence of 
fracture of the base on both sides Sanious discharge from 
both ears and deafness The fissure seemed to split the skull 
in two in the vertical plane A large flap connecting the two 
bone wounds was turned down and the skull trephined on the 
inner side of both the exit and entrance wounds Many 
fragments of bone were removed frdm dura mater and also 
blood clot and damaged brain matter The scalp wound 
united at once save over the anterior crown of trephine where 
it was healing by granulation on December 27th and where 
there seemed to be some tendency to hernia cerebri The 
deafness improved rapidly and the discharge from the ears 
at first abundantsoon ceased On December 27th he could 
hear well no facial paralysis The leg had recovered power 
to a very considerable extent but as usually happens the 
footdrop was almost complete The arm was still completely 
paralysed His memory and mental condition generally were 
practically normal Recovery seemed probable Further 
notes of this case are promised Probably the cortex was 
not damaged by the fragments of bone but the motor areas of 
the arm and leg were damaged by the track of the bullet 
passing close beneath the cortex 
In another case of wound at undoubted short range the 
bullet entered close to the longitudinal sinus in the 
occipital vein possibly even wounding it and passing out 
through the frontal bone traversing several inches of brain 
matter The skull was trephined in front of the posterior 
wound and it was found that a fissure connected the 
apertures of entrance and exit Fragments of bone were 
removed and brain matter Free hmorrhage necessitated 
plugging the wound posteriorly but it was not certain that 
the haemorrhage came from the longitudinal sinus Forty 
eight hours later the bleeding recurred on the removal of the 
plug and it was replaced Thenceforward rapid recovery 
The wound was received on December 15th and a month 
later the power had almost entirely returned in the arm and 
to a great extent in the leg but there was still marked foot 
drop The mental condition was altogether satisfactory 
THE HELMET AS A PROTECTION 
That the helmets worn by the men afford a considerable 
amount of protection the following cases will show 
In one of the actions near the Modder River a private pre 
sented himself with a scalp wound and a fissure of the skull 
According to his own account the injury caused symptoms 
of concussion The bullet was found beneath the inner 
canvas lining of the helmet having perforated the substance 
but failed to pass right through The canvas bulged in over 
the site of the head injury and the bullet a Mauser could 
be distinctly felt and rattled about 
In another instance a bullet traversed the frontal lobes 
from side to side and was found embedded in the substance 
of the helmet fitting firmly into the hole it had made No 
operation was performed in this case and there were abso 
lutely no symptoms The entrance and exit wounds were 
close to the coronal suture 
Probably in both these cases the wounds were inflicted at 
long range at say Iooo yards In the second case the possi 
bility of aftereffects occurring months or even years after the 
injury is one to be borne in mind The inner table judging 
by the experience of other cases was almost certainly broken 
and driven in to the dura mater to some extent As a curi 
osity may be here mentioned the case of a private In this 
instance the bullet entered just behind the left mastoid pro 
cess at the base evidently narrowly escaping the lateral 
sinus and passing out through the upper lip in the right side 
The wound healed throughout immediately 
Some apology is I feel needed for any absence of syste 
matic classification of the cases mentioned in this letter I 
have thought it better to content myself with little more than 
the bare record of the cases giving them more or less in the 
order in which they chance to have been seen Moreover our 
experience of the effects of the most modern firearms in actual 
warfare is still young and possibly large additions may be 
made to it before long The time will come later on for de 
liberate conclusions and for systematic analysis At present 
statistics are merely being collected and the opportunity for 
working out the results they may show has not arrived 
A PUZZLING CASE 
A case brought under my notice when the patient was in 
the hospital ship Lismore Castle is rather a puzzle The man 
was wounded at Colenso on December x5th The wounds in 
the scalp were characteristic of an ordinary Mauser bullet 
The entrance wound was through the left frontal bone on the 
level of the eminence and the exit through the parietal at 
the same level The track was almost exactly parallel to the 
longitudinal sinus and close to it There was no paralysis of 
the limbs The sole symptom was loss of vision of the left 
eye Lightcouldjustbe distinguished The man complained 
of weakness in the right eye The fundus oculi appeared per 
fectly normal 
There seemed to be no doubt that previous to the wound 
the vision of the left eye was natural No branch of the fifth 
nerve appeared to have been damaged sensation over the area 
supplied by the supraorbital nerve was normal as far as could 
be ascertained The loss of vision occurred immediately on 
the receipt of the wound The vision of the right eye was 
improving slowly but from the first was but little impaired 
No change had taken place in the course of some three weeks 
in the vision of the left eye Some considered that trephining 
was indicated in this case not so much in any hope of restor 
ing or improving vision but more because tolerably extensive 
injury to the inner table might from the experience of other

cases be anticipated So far however from this being done 
it was suggested not however by those immediately in charge 
of the ease that the man might return to the front as he was 
capable of taking aim with his right eye It is not in the least 
likely that many of the grave injuries will be considered really 
sufficiently recovered to go back to full duty 
HEMIPLEGIA DUE TO PERFORATING BULLET WOUNDS OF THE 
HEAD 
The following wound was almost certainly inflicted at long 
range Private G was wounded at Colenso on lecember Ixth 
The bullet entered close to the margin of the orbital arch in 
the left side half an inch internal to the supraorbital notch 
The exit was close to the lambdoid suture on the rightside 
some 2 inches below the level of the parietal eminence The 
bullet perforated the skull at the latter point but failed to 
pierce the scalp entirely and was pulled out by a comrade 
There was no loss of consciousness The epistaxis was very 
free The man was trephined on December 23rd close to the 
wound of exit which by some mistake was assumed to be the 
wound of entrance Fragments of loose bone were removed 
At the time of operation there was left hemiplegia and left 
facial paralysis The eyes were normal The motor area was 
examined at the time of operation but appeared to be unin 
jured Some brain matter escaped through the posterior 
wound however and there was evidently considerable lacera 
tion of the brain substance The occipital wound was seen 
clearly to be the aperture of exit as the bone was driven out 
wards at this point The story of the removal of the bullet 
was not communicated before the operation By January 
18th twentysix days afteroperation power of movement in the 
leg had been almost wholly restored but there was still com 
plete paralysis of the arm The facial paralysis which had 
been complete was then very slight The mental state was 
one of some hebetude In very few of the cases of grave head 
injury from bullet wounds is the irritability so often met with 
after head injuries in civil practice to be noticed The mental 
condition was slowly improving 
In several cases of hemiplegia from lesion of the cortical area 
the recovery of power in the arm is much slower than in the leg 
and in some at least the prospect of recovery at all seems 
questionable On the other hand the foot drop is usually the 
most persistent symptom in the leg which in not a few in 
stances recovers rapidly up to that point but then ceases to 
improve The frontal lobes in this and in many other of the 
cases must have bee4 extensively damaged but no appreci 
able effects were manifest As is commonly remarked the 
experience of gunshot wounds of the head in this war 
almost appears to render the use of the frontal lobes question 
able 
APHASIA TREPHINING GREAT IMPROVEMENT 
A case of considerable interest illustrating the fact that 
functional activity can be restored with almost as remarkable 
rapidity as the mechanical lesion is repaired is furnished by 
the following case 
A trooper in the Sohth African Light Horse like so many of 
these adventurous and loyal young men a man in good 
business position in Johannesburg was wounded at Colenso 
on December 15th The  entrance  wound was situated 
i2 inch above the left zygoma and the exit was about 3 inches 
higher up Evidently from the direction of the wound which 
was slightly oblique the area of Brocas convolution was likely 
to be injured The man did not lose consciousness when he 
was struck but was able to walk some 300 yards to an 
ambulance Arrived there according to his account he 
fainted He was sent down in due course to Maritzburg On 
admission he had aphasia there was loss of power in the 
right arm and left facial paralysis On December 22nd he 
was trephined the bone between the apertures of entrance 
and exit being freely removed Much loose bone was removed 
together with blood clot and brain matter Three days after 
the operation some power of speech returned The arm began 
rapidly to recover power and the facial paralysis to disappear 
By January 15th twentyfour days after the operation the 
arm had practically fully recovered its power The facial 
paralysis was still evident but was steadily mending His 
power of speech was good and he could converse readily 
enough though occasionally making mistakes in usinf common words Thus he occasionally said  Yes  for  No 
or vice verad On January x8th the power of speech had 
further markedly improved At the outset there was com 
plete agraphia Asked to write sometbing on January ioth he 
hesitated and waited for suggestion Some one said  Write 
 nurse which he immediately did without much difficulty 
Then he remarked that that was all very well but he 
could not write the letter he wanted to for he could 
not begin as he wished by writing  My dear brother Jack 
Asked to try to set down those words he wrote  Nun and 
then gave it up The word nurses he had previously 
written was before his eyes at the time 
A week later he wrote the sentence down fairly rapidly and 
quite accurately though whenever he came to the letter  r  
he hesitated unless it was repeated to him several times 
There may be further opportunity of seeing this case and I 
hope to send specimens of his writing at different dates with 
some remarks on the cerebral condition It was noticeable 
that with the left hand he wrote down fairly quickly what he 
was asked to write and that the power of doing simple 
arithmetical sums was not lost In this case there was some 
suppuration in the wound The long period that elapsed 
between the date of injury and that of operation in this and in 
other of the cases recorded is noteworthy 
BULLET WOUND PRODUCING DEPRESSED FRACTURE 
The following furnishes a good instance of the injury that 
may be inflicted when the bullet does not penetrate the 
skull It is really an example of deep gutter wound 
Private P wounded at Modder River was admitted at 
Wynberg some fortyeight hours after the injury On 
admission there were marked signs of compression The 
pulse was 40 There was paralysis of the left side of the face 
and tongue and loss of power in the left arm and leg Speech 
was very slow and imperfect and consciousnessat a low ebb 
The wound was situated in front of the lower end of the right 
Rolandic area On trephining an oval piece of the outer table 
was found to have been chipped off and through the opening 
the diplo1 could be seen The skull was unusually thick A 
crown of bone was removed with the trephine The Idura 
mater did not pulsate Several large fragments of bone pene 
trating the dura mater and much blood clot were removed 
As pulsation still did not return the dura mater was incised 
and more clot and fragments of bone removed from beneath it 
Eventually pulsation returned For some days subsequently 
the pulse remained slow and the symptoms seemed un 
relieved but ten days after the operation the pulserate rose 
to 74 and the paralysis rapidly cleared up For the foregoing 
notes I have to thank Mr J J Day the civil surgeon in 
charge of the case at Wynberg

IIIWOUNDS OF THE BLOOD VESSELS 
DEATHS FROM HAEMORRHAGE  
TEIB small general tendency to external heemorrhage exhibited 
by Mauser bullet wounds has already been alluded to but 
striking as this experience has been in cases of wounds of the 
soft parts involving small or moderatesized vessels it falls 
into insignificance in comparison with that of wounds impli 
cating the large arteries and veins 
Few cases of death from rapid primary hsemorrhage are 
observed further from the fighting line than the actual field 
hospitals and unfortunately we have no exact knowledge of 
the cause of death in many of those who die before they have
