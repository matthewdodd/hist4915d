THE PLAGUE 
Prevalence of the Disease 
INDLA 
There has been a considerable diminution in the deathrate for the whole 
of India during the week ending May 5th the mortality being 2498 against 
3365 in the previous seven day 
In Bombay city the subsidence of the epidemic has not been so great 
but the mortality fell to the extent of 52 the actual number of plague 
victims being 421 The hot weather therefore although it has brought an 
abatement has not coincided with so marked a decline in the plague 
mortality as the experience of previous years would have led us to 
expect 
in Calcutta the number of plague cases and deaths on April 25th 
26th 27th 28th 29th 30th and 3ifct were  fresh cases 57 38 33 36 49 30 
and 42  deaths 45 35 29 38 4429 and 46respectively or 256 deaths during 
the week from plaguea considerable abatement 
In Karachi from 40 to 50 fresh cases of plague occurred daily during the 
last week of April and from 30 to 40 deaths from the disease 
In Luc know the attendance at the hospitals has fallen off to a very 
great extent owing to a scare amongst the people that if seen to be unwell 
at all they will be taken to the plague camp There is no severe outbreak 
but the community are in a state of alarm 
In the Mysore province only 4 indigenous cases of plague were reported 
during the week ending April 20th 
Aden 
At Aden 86 death3 from plague occurred during the week endirg 
May ist 
Egypt 
At Port Said during May 14th 15th 16th and 17th 10 fresh cases of 
plague occurred In all 31 cases of plague are reported to have occurred 
at Port Said with 15 deaths from the disease The finding of numerous 
dead rats and mice in the city and at the wharves of Port Said seem to 
prsagea widespread infection The destruction of rats and mice has 
beendetermined upon by the authorities There is considerable local 
distress amongst the labouring population of Port Said owing to the 
quarantine regulations which has almost stopped all work at the wharves 
Certain French newspapers are protesting against the imposition of 
3uarantine 
on th grounds that the disease is not plague but asimilar 
isease with another name This is a most dangerous doctrine and on 
the face of it untrue   
In Alexandria one case of plague occurred on May 16th

THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
WITH THE NATAL FIELD FORCE 
From an Occasional Correspondent 
Enteric Fever 
Following almost immediately on the relief of Lady smith a 
sharp outbreak of enteric fever has occurred amongst the 
troops of the relieving force This is the more to be regretted 
as up to the final attack on the Boer position the force was 
practically free from the disease When however we conr 
sider the conditions to which the troops were exposed during 
their attack on Pieters Hill the wonder is not that enteric 
fever has broken out among them but rather that the out 
break has been so limited During the seventeen days that 
the final attack lasted the men slept in the open without a 
vestige of cover As the Boers were driven back our men 
took shelter in their trenches These trenches had been 
occupied by the enemy for many weeks without the faintest 
attempt at sanitation Their condition was indescribably 
filthy There was no help for it however and our troops had 
to occupy them for days together At the same time it was 
often impossible during the daytime to send up drinking 
water to the troops in advanced positions as every approach 
was swept by the Boer fire The men therefore drank from 
every pool in their neighbourhood whether it was contamin 
ated or not There can be no doubt that enteric fever existed 
amongst the Boer forces and that our men contracted the dis 
ease whilst occupying the trenches which they had captured 
from the enemy 
Most of the cases I have seen in Natal present the classical 
symptoms of enteric fever with this exception however 
that tympanites appears tobe a somewhat rare condition As 
yet I have not noted those hybrid cases to which the name 
typhomalarial has been applied in tropical countries In 
Natal at least the rash is usually very profuse and well de 
fined On the whole the cases are of moderate severity but a 
very large percentage far exceeding the average are attended 
by intestinal haemorrhage This no doubt is due to the fact 
that on field service it is impossible for patients to have the 
absolute rest and freedom from excitement which is so im 
portant a part of the treatment in permanent hospital The 
treatment at present in vogue in Natal is almost exclusively 
by intestinal antiseptics the only variation being in the re 
agent used Some prefer salol some carbolic acid some again 
Barney Yeos chlorine mixture 
Dysentery 
Dysentery is also very prevalent Some at least of the 
medical officers with the force attribute the disease to irrita 
tion of the intestinal tract set up by particles of sand dust 
etc which are accidentally swallowed with food or water 
With this opinion however I cannot agree It is easy by 
close observation to satisfy oneself that the dysentery from 
which the troops are now suffering and similarly all or almost 
all dysentery on field service is due to constantlyrecurring 
abdominal chills contracted during sleep O wing to the diffi 
culties of transport only one blanket for two men and one 
waterproof sheet for each man can be carried With this 
slight covering the men sleep on the ground in all weathers 
Under these circumstances the nightlyrecurring chills sooner 
or later bring on dysentery in those who are at all predisposed 
to the disease Sand dust impure water and indigestible 
food increase the liability to an attack by exciting local irrita 
tion but they cannot directly cause it In Natal the disease 
is seen in two forms namely  
i CatarrhalIn this which is really a catarrhal colitis 
the motions consist largely of opaque mucus which is often 
slightly bloodstained There are few symptoms beyond an 
uncomfortable feeling of flatulence and distension with fre 
quent calls to stool If the patient is warmly wrapped up at 
the beginning of the attack it may pass off without any further 
treatment If neglected the attack may develop into the 
second and graver form It is in this the catarrhal form 
that a saturated solution of magnesium sulphate is found so 
useful  
2 Ulcerative This which is much rarer and graver than 
the first variety is usually the final stage of the neglected 
catarrhal form It may however be a primary affection at

13 n 
least in some cases It is accompanied by marked depression 
and by all the graver symptoms of dysentery As the cases 
advance the motions contain more and more blood until 
finally they consist almost wholly of long black shreddy 
coagula When this form of dysentery is fully established 
treatment at least in the field is practically hopeless Every 
known remedy and combination of remedies including rectal 
injections of boric acid tannic acid and silver nitrate have 
been tried and have signally failed 
Hospital Administration 
Since the relief of Lady smith the Royal Medical Corps have 
had to face a most difficult situation the difficulties being 
much increased by the fact that in Natal there are practically 
no public buildings which can be taken over to meet a sudden 
emergency of this kind What it meant when 2500 sick and 
wounded were suddenly released from Ladysmith and added 
to the already huge list of sick and wounded belonging to 
the relieving force may be imagined Under the circum 
stances it was well that the corps in Natal had at its head two 
such experienced and able officers as Colonels T J Gallwey 
and W B Allin They have met the emergency with such 
energy and resource that all difficulties are rapidly disappear 
ing and it is confidently expected that in a few days the medical 
arrangements will again be working with their original ease 
and smoothness None however who are not on the spot can 
realise the difficulties which the Royal Medical Corps have 
had to contend with owing to reduced establishments and 
limited accommodation For years past the pruning hook has 
been vigorously applied to the Corps Under its use the 
strength of both officers and men has been reduced to such a 
degree that before the war commenced the establishment was 
insufficient to perform the duties which devolved upon it even 
in times of peace The deficiency has of course been made 
up by employing civilians but the great drawback to this 
system is that there is no reserve of trained officers and men 
to meet the numerous casualties which have already occurred 
At the present moment there is not a single field hospital in 
Natal which has its full complement of officers and men most 
of them having lost from 20 to 40 per cent of their establish 
ment from sickness and other casualties The Medical 
is the only unit which has to work under such a disadvantage 
Regimental casualties are made up as rapidly as possible by 
drafts from England The Royal Medical Corps however 
having no reserve to fall back upon cannot be dealt with in 
this way 
Several changes in the distribution of field hospitals have re 
cently taken place The Fifth and Sixth Brigades which now 
form the Tenth Division have gone round to the Cape to join 
the force under Lord Roberts At the time of their departure their field hospitals were so full of sick that they could not 
move They had therefore to be left behind The Fifth 
Brigade Field Hospital under Major G H Younge which has 
been present at each of Sir Redvers Bullers battles has joined 
the newlyformed Eighth Brigade so that it will no longer be 
known by its original number As the Fifth Brigade Field 
Hospital I hear that this unit has treated over 1000 cases of 
gunshot wounds and about an equal number of sick which is 
probably a record in field hospital work The Sixth Brigade 
Field Hospital under Major C W Thiele has joined the 
Seventh Brigade 
Contagious Diseases 
The present campaign has once more brought to the front 
the question of contagious diseasesand has shown how urgently 
some stringent measure is needed to check the spread of these 
diseases in the army It is only during a campaign that one 
can fully realise the ravages which result from venereal di 
seases Men who are the subjects of constitutional syphilis 
may continue to perform their routine duties during peace 
time Send them on field service however and they 
almost at once break down and develop the worst and most 
loathsome sequelae of the disease Large numbers of these 
men have reached South Africa only to flood the hospitals and 
occupy the accommodation which has been prepared for their 
wounded 
comrades 
THsestate of the late Dr William Chapman Grigg who died 
at Wynberg of enteric fever has been proved of the gross 
value of 8495119s 6d including personal estate and the nett 
value of 44945 ios iod 
SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOS 
PITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
From our Special War Correspondent 
Capetown March 20th 1900 
SECOND THOUGHTSContinued 
Wounds of the Thorax 
There is little that calls for remark concerning the surgical 
treatment of wounds of the thorax The question of extract 
ing the bullet in some of these cases will be dealt with later 
on The ordinary penetrating wound seldom required any 
operative treatment unless it were the removal of loose 
splinters of fractured ribs or sternum Hsemothorax was a 
very common sequel As a rule the condition subsided 
spontaneously Occasionally if the breathing was much 
embarrassed it was thought necessary to aspirate the pleural 
cavity This is an unsatisfactory proceeding at the best for 
hsemothorax for the rule is a sound one that in dealing with 
a large effusion of blood it is best to leave it alone if the blood 
and clot cannot be most thoroughly evacuated a condition 
that is seldom possible in hsemothorax Sometimes the 
elevation of the temperature led to the suspicion that pus was 
forming But the temperature in almost every case of 
hsemothorax rises two or three degrees above the normal n 
the early stages gradually sinking to the level of health in 
the course of a week or so if the case proceeds favourably 
It may be a mistaken impression though I think it is one 
that will subsequently be borne out by the returns when I 
say that in the earlier part of the campaign trouble but seldom 
followed those aspirating or exploratory punctures whereas 
later on empyema which was not revealed by the puncture 
occasionally followed Certainly in the later stages of the 
campaign in the months of February and March for instance 
and in the more trying damp and enervating climate of 
Natal cases of empyema occurred with more frequency 
wholly apart from any accidental infection other than that of 
the original wound These were treated in the ordinary 
way a portion of rib usually being removed A case of sup 
purating pericarditis the collection of pus being very exten 
sive was also I understand for I did not see this patient 
treated with success by simple incision 
Wounds of the Heart 
While on the topic of thoracic wounds mention may be 
made of injuries of the heart Judging by the wounds of 
entrance and exit and the direction there seemed little or no  
doubt that recovery took place in some cases in which the 
heart was wounded There is of course nothing very novel 
or surprising in such cases and no very profound disturbance 
need be anticipated from a small clean bullet passing at high 
velocity through the muscular substance of this organ In 
one case at least in which the bullet passed through the 
cavity the effect was not immediately fatal the patient sur 
viving for a week or two The diagnosis of heart wound was 
verified but unfortunately I am unable at present to furnish 
precise details  I trust they may be forthcoming 
Empyema 
The cases of empyema did well for the most part the pro 
gress in the men being more like that seen in children 
There was however a tendency possibly the criticism is 
prompted by prejudice to the overuse of drainage tubes a 
tendency that might be defended as regards cases of empy 
ema but was decidedly wellfounded as a general rule with 
respect to deep suppuration Over and over again cases were 
met with in which convalescence was retarded and not pro 
moted by the routine employment of drainage tubing The 
best surgical practice has been modified considerably and 
with great advantage to the patient in this detail of late 
years and it seemed rather an anachronism to find in some of 
the wards that almost every opening that could accommodate 
a tube had got one in it Few surgeons now I imagine in 
our civil hospitals think it necessary to put a drainage tube 
as  routine practice into an amputation Such wounds out 
here are more favoured jn the matter of healing than at home 
but they were seldom allowed the chance of healing abso 
lutely throughout by immediate union In the same way 
the practice too often followed of stuffing gauze into any
