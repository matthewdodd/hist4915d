uests Such offers as appear suitable are bein considered 
nut we understand that the authorities in Pall Mall have 
misgivings as to the advisability of accepting them unless it 
be in the homes of officers or others accustqmed to the 
management of soldiers Numerous small homes are not 
considered practicable on account of the impossibility of pro 
viding for proper discipline and military supervision The 
distribution of the men among such homes as may be ulti 
mately accepted will be arranged on the territorial system 
the soldiers being sent to such establishments as are in 
proximity to their usual military dep6ts 
It is clear that ample accommodation can be secured by the 
authorities to supplement their own which is utterly in 
adequate and that private generosity backed by the 
numerous public funds will provide the necessary means 
But so far no very decided action would seem to have been 
taken to secure the advantage of this humane and practical 
patriotism and to ensure that the accommodation for con 
valescent soldiers shall be ready in good time At the moment 
it is true the demand for such quarters for those invalided from 
the front is very smalland the War Office does not seem to antici 
pate the need of even extra hospital beds for two or three 
months to come But the sick and wounded are already 
arriving and the period of grace for preparation will be short 
It is very greatly to be hoped that it will not be allowed to slip 
away but that the War Office will lose no time in definitely 
accepting and organising such of the numerous privately 
offered convalescent homes as are most suitable The sugges 
tions which have been made of providing accommodation of 
the kind at Cape Town itself and the offer by Messrs Elder 
Dempster and Co of beds in their hotel at Las Palmas are 
well worthy of careful consideration There is not much time 
left however which can be legitimately devoted to mere con 
sideration and whatever is going to be done in the matter 
should be done promptly 
As regards officers the Duke of Abercorn has initiated a 
Sick and Wounded Officers Surgical and Medical Aid 
Fund which includes among its objects the provision 
of convalescent accommodation and promises to afford 
much needful help in a quarter where it will be almost 
as much required as in the case of the rank and file The 
Committee recognise that the task of dispensing this aid 
will require much tact and discretion The work of this 
fund will be supplemented by the generous offers of accom 
modation not only at home but in the Riviera Madeira and 
elsewhere 
ARMY MEDICAL REFORM 
THE longcontinued and bitter opposition in past years to 
reform in the status of medical officers left a deep distrust 
which has delayed that rehabilitation which its friends 
believed would have speedily followed the granting of genuine 
army status and title in a Royal Medical Corps Distrust 
easily engendered is difficult to remove so that even if the 
concession of due status to medical officers has silenced if 
not shamed their more aggressive opponents it has as yet 
notbeen entirely successful in inducing young medical men 
to select the army as a suitable professional career But we 
cannot doubt that great and farreaching reform will yet do 
so provided certain muchneeded reforms consecutive to the 
creation of the Royal Corps are now promptly taken in hand 
The coming wave of general army reform which must 
follow the Boer war will doubtless include the medical 
service and it is fortunate for it that its old opponents may 
have little say in its new reorganisation The time for 
formulating the reforms wanted is distinctly propitious and 
to this end we welcome the able and temperate article which 
Major Cockerill has published recently1 He enumerates 
many obstacles to the attractiveness and popularily of the 
service which must be removed before it can become a truly 
efficient or contented body 
We take no objection to any of his strictures but think his 
statement of them somewhat diffuse and fr the benefit of 
those who may have to handl practicdlly the reforms it 
would be well to group them under a few inclusive heads 
such as the following X Undermanned establishments 
2 questions of pay 3 honours and rewards 4 revision of 
regulations 
The increase of establishments is the first and most press 
ing The medical service must be made at least numerically 
sufficient for all average duties This it certainly is not at 
present Further from undermanning flow many of the 
worst disabilities from which it suffers 
An establishment of l ooo medical officers has been sug 
gested as a minimum Whether sufficient or not they would 
still be much under the total strength of the department of 
thirty or forty years ago Of course suoh an increase like the 
increase of cavalry or artillery means money but we greatly 
misjudge the present temptr of the country if it permits 
clamant Army reforms to be sacrificed to a false economy or 
to mere bud get balancing 
As Major Cockerill demonstrates it may be easier to vote an 
increased establishment than to fill it unless the War Office 
faces squarely and fairly the question of medical supply and 
demand It is believed by many that the available supply of 
medical men will be lessened in the future by the extension 
of an expensive curriculum to five years 
It is urged further that the prohibition of unqualified 
assistantships has so increased the salaries of assistants in 
civil practice that they now equal or surpass in value the 
pay of a lieutenant Royal Army Medical Corps due allowance 
being of course made for unavoidable outlay in the service 
The Army has also to compete with the Indian Medical 
Service which despite drawbacks offers a more varied career 
more fixed appointments and higher pensions with scarcely 
greater tropical service From all these considerations it is 
clear that considerable amelioration in the terms of Army 
service will have to be effected especially in the junior ranks 
before it can successfully compete in the open market 
Undermanning of the medical service is the fruitful source 
of drawbacks and hardships and is thus the indirect cause of 
much of its unpopularity To it may be traced the grievous 
inequality between home and foreign tours the worry and 
expense attendant on incessant movements the drudgery 
irksome and irritating of perpetually recurring orderly duty 
the difficulty in getting private and the impossibility of ob 
taining  study leave 
In short through undermanning the medical service is over 
strained at home and abroad overworked everywhere and 
hustled and worried to an intolerable degree 
It is at present at least 30 short of an arbitrary nominal 
strength of 890 and that number is about 20 per cent under 
the strength deemed necessary thirty or forty years ago when 
our empire and our army were much smaller than now It 
has thus been allowed to dwindle down while its duties in 
creased until it is now numerically unequal to the work 
whether in peace or in war 
Questions of pay mubt obviously be considered in relation 
to those of supply and demand in the medical profession at 
large to which we have already alluded but they can be 
viewed on their merits in which sense we assett without 
hesitation that an increase is necessaTy both in the home and 
Indian rates in the ranks of lieutenants and captains 
Neither scales of pay are sufficiently above those now given 
to civil assistants and are indeed insufficient to meet the 
necessary expenses of the officer The junior ranks spend a 
large proportion of their total service under the Government 
of India which benefits much by such a facile arrangement 
yet it has treated the financial parts of several Royal Warrants 
affecting medical offilers with a neglect which absolutely 
amounts to a scandal 
Army medical officers are still paid in India according to 
the provisions of warrants which have been cancelled and 
obsolete for more than twenty years Successive Secretaries 
of War and for India have been often entreated to put an end 
to such an injustice but have failed to do so It remains for 
Parliament to insist that the Indian Executive must and shall 
respect the financial provisions of Royal Warrants 
Not only does the Government of Irndia pay the officers of 
the RAMU less than theirown medicalofficers but also less 
than those of any Ecientific or kindred branchthe Veterinary 
for instance While we by no means consider that braneh 
overpaid yet a veterinary lieutenant receives many more 
rupees a month than a medical lieutenant showing that

greater store is apparently set on the horse than on the man 
who rides him 
The distribution of honours and rewards to medical officers 
has long been in most scanty proportions compared with other 
officers as the present war again demonstrates although 
medical officers share in all the hardships and many of the 
risks of their combatant brethren their allotment of the 
mystic letters CB KGB CMG etc is merely nominal 
compared with other branches Nor as far as known has the 
Indian Government which makes so great on economy out of 
the services of the army medical officers ever recommended 
one of them even for the lowest class of the Star of India 
The attitude of the dispensers of honours is clearly exem 
plified in the omission of the name of the principal medical 
officer of the last Soudan expedition notwithstanding that he 
was absolutely the senior officer present from the big list of 
those to whom the thanks of Parliament were tendered and 
worse still when the omission was challenged a Minister was 
put up not to apologise but to defend in the lamest way such 
a grossly indefensible thing 
As to tangible rewards they are nonexistent to the vast 
bulk of the medical service The few good service pensions 
on the principle of the confided talents are carefully reserved 
for the senior rank only chiefly we suppose because it is 
senior 
Revision of the Regulations is necessary in two directions 
first all obsolete or unnecessary paragraphs and articles which 
assert or imply the bad old supposed inferiority of medical 
officers should be expunged secondly new regulations 
which shall define the position of medical officers on parade 
and ceremonial occasions and their position on Courts Boards 
etc should be inserted Even commissions in the RAMC 
are still not worded in corps or regimental form but in that of 
an extinct department 
The Regulations Branch of the War Office want waking 
up to such anomalies 
We have not in this review been able to go into details but 
we trust we have sufficiently indicated broadly the rejorms 
which demand speedy attention by those who may desire to 
take effective action towards the rehabilitation of the Army

THE ST JOHN AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION 
STOCKPORT CENTRE 
AN account of the difficulty which had arisen at Stockport 
with regard to the administration of the St John Ambulance 
Association centre there and of the action which the Stock 
port Medical Society had felt itself compelled to take was 
published in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of April 22nd 
I899 We then observed that the honorary secretary of the 
local centre appeared to have mistaken the relation in which 
the St John Ambulance Association stands to the medical 
profession and observed that it was intolerable that members 
of the medical profession should be treated with the dis 
courtesy shown to them by the representatives of the St 
John Ambulance Association at Stockport As we were able 
to announce last October the matter was finally referred to 
arbitration and a brief report of the proceedings before the 
arbitrators was published in the BRiIns MEDICAL JOUIRNAL of 
November 4th 1899 We have now received the following 
award of the arbitrators 
St John Ambulance Association 
St Johns Gate Clerkenwell London EC 
AWARD OF THE ARBITRATORS 
SIR JAMEs N DICK KCB Colonel C Bowdlier and InspectorGeneral 
Belgrave Ninnis MD RN were the arbitrators appointed by the 
Central Executive Committee to inquire into certain differences of 
opinion at the Stockport Centre 
ln the summer and autumn of last year the Committee of the St John 
Ambulance Association being the Ambulance Department of the Order 
of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England were asked by both 
the Stockport and District Medical Society and by the Executive of the 
Local Centre of the St John Ambulance Association at Stockport to 
entertain and arbitrate upon aquestion which had arisen between these 
two bodies out of the management by Mr Ferns the Honorary Secretary 
and Treasurer of the Local Centre 
Neither the Order itself nor the Ambulance Department of the Order 
have any function to arbitrate upon such a question but the two parties 
having agreed in writing to refer the matter to three gentlemen appointed 
by the Committee of the St John Ambulance Association as arbitrators 
and we having been appointed by the Committee in that behalf and our 
appointment having been assented to by both sides proceeded to Stock 
port with a view to hearing what was to be adduced by each side and to 
make such an award determination or decision in the premises as alter 
hearing the evidence and arguments we should think fit 
Two prolonged meetings were held at the Stockport Courthouse at 
Stockport on October aoth and 3xst last At these the following parties 
were represented and in the following manner 
The Earl Egerton of Tatton Chancellor of the Order of St John of 
Jerusalem in England and President of the Stockport Centre by Mr 
Boydell Houghton Barrister 
Mr A E Ferns Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Stockport 
Centre also by Mr Houghton 
Mr A H Sykes JP Chairman of the Stockport Centre by Mr Williaum 
Cobbett Solicitor and 
The Stockport and District Medical Society by Mr C H M Wharton 
Barrister 
After a patient hearing of all that was to be said and an expression of 
opinion on both sides that nothing further remained we have taken into 
consideration the whole circumstances of the case with a view to arriving 
at an award determination or decision 
At the very commeneement of the hearing it appeared that there was no 
question between the Stockport Medical Society and the Stockport Centre 
of the St John Ambulance Association and Mr Wharton so stated It 
became apparent then that the question was going to resolve itself into a 
personal one between Mr Ferns and the Stockport Medical Society and 
the only manner in which the Centre was interested in the proceeding 
was that Mr Ferns was the Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the 
Centre and the Medical Society had resolved to abstain from lecturing in 
connection with the Local Centre and threatened to form an indepencent 
ambulance association 
With the last of these two suggestions the arbitrators do not intend to 
interfere If it was intended as a threat it should not have been made as 
it can have no influence The former of these suggestions does affect 
the Order and it was upon that ground that the arbitrators thought it 
within their province to continue the inquiry 
They wish however at the outset to express their great regret that 
having regard to the position occupied by the Medical Society and Mr 
Ferns some way had not been found to compose this personal question 
without having to resort to the extraordinary method of referring it to a 
public hearing 
As the case proceeded the official aspect of the question between the 
Executive Committee ol the Stockport Centre and the Medical Society 
still further disappeared and the personal one only remained If this 
could have been anticipated we are not sure that the Ambulance Depart 
went would have undertaken the reference at all but having done so 
snd the parties having undergone the expense of the proceeding we 
think it would not be fair to them not to record our decision and deter 
mination 
Mr Fernss own account of himself is that the Committee was formed 
and he was appointed Local Secretary so far back as the year i883 and cer 
tain instruction were given him by Sir then Mr John Furley In a short 
time meetings of the Committee were held but difficulties arose in this 
out of the nonattendance of members and Mr Ferns considered thatthe 
authority given to him by Sir John Furley justified his future 
proceedings which were practically to carry on the Centre without 
the attendance of a Committee We think that Mr Ferns has at all 
events since z888 been acting under a misapprehension We do not 
think Mr Ferns understood the change that had taken plae in the 
constitution of the St John Ambulance Association in the year x888 
At that time the Association became a department of the Order subject 
to the rulea and regulations of the Order and although considerable 
latitude in carrying on a voluntary institution must always be allowed 
still there are certain definite duties which Mr Ferns seems entirely to 
have lost sight of We wish to put on record that we think in this matter 
Mr Ferns is to be blamed because he himself is an esquire of the Order 
a member of the body and therefore has a special duty to the Order and 
to see that as far as in him lies everything is done for its glory and 
utility and that he will never act contrary to its dignity 
We think if Mr Ferns had found that he could not maintain the Centre 
he should have so reported and not have left the Centre to be practicallr 
himself particularly in the light of subsequent events 
It seems to us to have been alleged and hardly disputed by Mr Ferns 
that he discharged the duties of secretary and afterwards treasurer of the 
Stockport Centre in a somewhat arbitrary manner and that accounts 
were not rendered by him nor were subscriptions collected by him in 
the district It seems also admitted that the Stockport Centre was more 
or less in a state of paralysis Mr Fearns calls it quiescence and we can 
not help feeling that Mr Ferns was to some extent responsible for this 
It further appeared that there was a rumouralthough the rumour was 
a floating one and could not definitely be tracedthat some illdefined 
charge had been made against Mr Feans of having acted improperly with 
regard to the funds of the Centre The existence of such a rumour was 
particularly with regard to a charge of La 5s for classes admitted by 
both sides If the Committee had met such a rumour would have been 
impossible We wish here to state that the charge of 5 58 to the 
classes referred to in the course of the inquiry was a proper charge 
It seems clear to us that Mr Ferns was under the impression erroneous 
as we believe it to be that this rumour originated from some medical 
gentlemen of position in the town We are satisfied that Mr Ferns has 
in all his dealings with regard to the funds of the Centre acted with the 
utmost integrity and this cannot be questioned We also feel assured 
tbat the impression in Mr Fernss mind as to the origin of the rumours 
we have mentioned was unfounded 
It appeared to us that Mr Ferns did in his dealings with various 
medical men in the town in connection with his secretaryship 
comport himself in a manner which cannot be said to have been 
courteous or conciliatory or to have been for the dignity or utility of 
the Order and for this we consider that Mr Ferns Is to blame Jn what 
ever way Mr Ferns might bave considered himself in his private capacity 
justified in treating the medical men in respect of whose conduct he had 
this suspicion Mr Ferns should have remembered that he was a mem ber 
of the Order and holding an important and responsible official posit ion 
In connection with the ambulance department of the Order and what he
