THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
FROM BLOEMFONTEIN TO PRETORIA 
By Sir William Thomson 
SurgeoninChief Irish Hospital South African Field Force 
From Bloemfontein to Kroonstadt 
Bloemfontein was a vast improvement upon Naauwpoort but 
I was glad to leave it if only for a change The position of 
the Irish Hospital camped on the gentle slope of the principal 
kopje of the town was all that was desirable It commanded a 
view of a great plain and of hills whose names are wellknown 
at homeLeenberg Bushmans Kop Springfield and the great 
towering Thaba Nchu round which fights soon began to wage 
and we could hear the booming of guns and occasionally see 
the column of smoke of a burning farm But for all that we 
were afflicted by a special curse in the shape of flies The 
wintry chill of the evenings drove them into the tents where 
they ranged themselves in armies and battalions to the 
number of hundreds of thousands At lunch time when the 
eun had given them a new fillip they descended upon us from 
the tent ceiling and assailed everything that was eatable 
They challenged the right of anyone to food and impudently 
wrestled with the morsel on its way to your mouth  rushed 
headlong into soup or milk or tea and generally did their 
best to make the life of the invading stranger as miserable as 
possible So when the order came on Wednesday May 9th to 
move the ambulance portion of the hospital to the front I had 
at least one joy to oppose to some regrets 
The equipment of our hospital included 15 ambulance 
waggons and 10 large tortoise tents with about 25 small 
square bell tents I determined to take 10 ambulances 6 
small tents and 4 large These last were arranged so that 
the top bar of the waggon served as the central support the 
ides being rolled up and a little drill enabled us to pitch a 
tent to contain 14 patients in about eight minutes I took 
with me Dr Coleman Dr Pounden Mr Percy Stewart and 
Mr Douglas Thomson with orderlies and drivers leaving 
behind 60 occupied beds in charge of Dr George Stoker Dr 
Friel Mr Macllwaine and Mr Edwardes 
We left Bloemfontein on Thursday afternoon May 10th with 
14 waggons and carts and made our first halt about six miles 
out Thence we passed through Glen Karee Siding Brand 
fort Vet River Smaldeel Welgelegen Zand River Geneva 
Siding on to Kroonstadt For a day we were advised to 
march with a large column as the enemy was reported to be 
ahead of us in force  but he did not appear and as our pro 
gress was slow we slipped away in the early morning and 
made our own way thereafter reaching the headquarters at 
Kroonstadt at 1 oclock on Thursday May 17th 
The country through which we passed and over which the 
advancing army had already preceded us was very different 
irom Cape Colony or the Great Karoo For a day or two the 
kopjes had been diminishing in numbers Now and again we 
could trace the banks of some intermittent stream by the 
presence of thorn bushes The plain was no longer sparsely 
grassed but there was gradually increasing fodder as we got 
north At last at Theron we left the last kopje behind us 
and although we saw it for a long time we saw no semblance 
of another in the three days that elapsed before our arrival at 
Kroonstadt The plains seemed endless Far as one could 
see there was nothing but grass Day after day we went along 
meeting not more than two or three people and seeing no 
signs of habitation but an occasional house or Kaffirs kraal 
sometimes miles away from our track The farms uniformly 
displayed a white flag Some of them I visited but the only 
occupants were women and children or very old men The 
young men were in some commando but their mothers and 
sisters at home only wished that the war was at an end They 
asked anxiously if more troops were coming for they had seen 
column after column pass in long streams and the only 
answer was that they were coming like waves of the sea 
To those who see the veld in this region and trek across it 
for the first time there must be I think a powerful fascina 
tion I had never seen plains so vast so silent and so void 
of human life What we looked upon were called farms 
but they were really great cattle ranches No hedgerow or 
wall broke the landscape The immense plain often fiat as a 
cricket field for miles sometimes rolling away in farstretch 
ing undulations was only marked at great distances by the 
wellknown barbed wire fences which marked out the limits 
of the property As to tillage there was practically none 
except a few patches of Kaffir corn or mealies  perhaps they 
were almost swallowed in the surrounding vastness of grass 
land and were really more extensive than I thought 
Life from this week was a delight Up at 4 oclock we 
breakfasted in the moonlight at 5 and were well on our way 
at 6 just as the day began to break The mornings were very 
sharpI have seen ice an inch thick herebut by 9 oclock 
the greatcoat was abandoned and for the rest of the day we 
had a really hot sun Walking riding driving followed in 
turn and then dinner at 6 in the moonlight again The sense 
of freedom in this great solitude  the exhilarating air  the 
brisk bracing cool of the evening were unspeakably attrac 
tive  and the unbroken sleep that followed such a day even 
on the floor of a waggon made me often declare that this was 
the real cure for insomnia 
On arriving at Kroonstadt I was informed by Colonel 
Stevenson thePMO in the field that we were to be attached 
to the Guards Brigade in the Eleventh Division under General 
PoleCarew  but subsequently this was changed and we were 
ordered to act as field hospital to the Royal Artillery the 
Naval Brigade the Royal Engineers and generally to the 
divisional troops 
From Kroonstadt to Johannesburg 
The now famous march of Lord Robertss army from 
Kroonstadt to Johannesburg ending in the surrender of the 
latter town began on Tuesday May 22nd and ended on the 
following Tuesday when we reached Elandsfontein a suburb 
and seized the railway junction It was a novel thing to have 
a civil hospital and ambulances in the field and every man of 
us was proud to take a part in this great historical event No 
other civilian hospital was thus honoured but they were all 
doing their share of work at Bloemfontein and other places in 
the rear 
Each day we expected to fight On Wednesday the news 
was that 6000 Boers were entrenched across our path but 
General French and Colonel Hutton who were operating with 
cavalry and mounted infantry a long way in front turned 
their flank and they fled This was the daily course of events 
We could hear the big guns thundering ahead of us for an 
hour or two then followed silence and we knew that the 
enemy had again retired The interest of the day for us was 
in part centred in crossing fearful drifts or discussing the pro 
babilities of what would happen at Johannesburg We were 
without news of the outside world We had no letters or 
newspapers  we did not know what was happening on our 
right or left save through vague rumours which always took 
the most exaggerated shape  and we rather envied the people 
at home who knew all about the stirring events that were 
happening 
The destruction of the railway line was remarkable 
Splendid bridges at Kroonstadt and other places had been 
utterly ruined There appeared to be a special malice in 
reducing high piers and buttresses to stoneheaps Every 
culvert was gone and as we approached the Vaal the line itself 
had been more frequently attacked The plan was to place 
dynamite under the joinings of the rails and blow them up 
Freed from its holdings the steel sprang up in great curves 
and as you looked along for miles you saw these weird arms 
extended into the air It seemed impossible that the repairs could be quickly effected but the Royal Engineers and the 
Railway Pioneers struggled with the wreck night and day 
and the railhead was only two days behind us at some 
points 
The supply of a great army in the field with food is a diffi 
culty which perhaps does not present itself to the average 
mind In Europe there are plenty of railways  here there is 
one and that a single line The food for this armya 
thousand miles up into Africahad to be carried by ox 
waggons Each of these uses about sixteen or twenty animals 
and this may give an idea of what a huge cavalcade followed 
the troops The supply of food has been a triumph of manage 
ment and Colonel Ward CB and his star have done 
marvels A German officer who knows the country told me 
that even to Africanders it was astonishing and that no other

nation could have done what he had seen accomplished during 
this campaign 
We arrived at the Vaal River on Sunday May 27th and 
looked for the first time upon the Transvaal We expected a 
stand here  but as usual the Boers were driven out on the 
day before and we were free to cross We rode through 
the river and then we realised that we had already con 
quered one country and were entering upon the conquest of 
another 
On Monday May 28th we marched twentytwo miles to 
Klip River and encamped and next morning started at 6 
for Johannesburg It was a day to be remembered We had 
not gone a mile before we learned that one of the big 7ton 
47 naval guns had gone through the bridge I went on to 
see what had happened I found a deep sluggish stream 
about 20 feet wide and over this a structure of tree trunks 
the only road bridge I had seen since I left Capetown 
The huge gun was lying on its side one wheel 
touching the water the other in the air Fortunately 
the lignt guns and the infantry had got over but 
for everything else in the shape of wheeled vehicles 
passage was impossible The engineers put up a trestle 
bridge but it broke down under a big telegraph waggon and 
then another had to be got up In four hours by the aid of 
men and eighty oxen the gun was extricated Then a drift 
had to be made and finally after a delay of eight hours we 
were able to cross We had still to march seventeen miles 
and there remained only a couple of hours of daylight but we 
hurried on As the sun went down I saw on the left a ridge 
of lowlying hills and there in the twilight halfadozen tall 
chimneysone smokingthat told me I was looking upon 
Johannesburg After tnis the journey was intricate and very 
tiring The column made its way over stony hills full of ruts 
littered with small boulders The night was very dark and 
there was a piercing wind Kaffirs shouted at their teams 
mules gave out oxen bellowed and the waggons rumbled 
along colliding with stones rolling into waterways until one 
wondered how long the fore carriages would stand For hours 
we went on looking eagerly for a camp fire and then at 9 
we reached our destination We were at Elandsfontein and 
were overlooking Johannesburg We had done a record march 
with really very little loss For six days our ambulance 
waggons had carried on the sick and wounded because they 
could not be sent back by convoy and although many were 
very ill we had lost none 
Next day we moved to a pleasant field sheltered by trees 
and pitched all our big tents to accommodate 50 patients 
beside the Guards Hospital Here more sick and several 
wounded were received On Thursday morning May 31st at 
1030 in the middle of dressing woik I had orders from 
Colonel Magill of the Guards PMO of the division 
whose unfailing courtesy and zeal I wish to acknowledge 
that we were to pack up at once and carry all our patients to 
Johannesburg for the surrender had been made In an hour 
and a half we were readyall our sick and wounded packed 
into the waggons and tents struck We joined a long convoy 
and started passing through the overground works of gold 
mines whose names are famousSimmer and Jack Gelden 
huis Deep and othersalong coaldust roads and under a 
sun that blistered ones face and lips The line of waggons 
and troops extended for miles and marked its advance by 
clouds of dust The inevitable blocks occurred but at last 
we came upon scattered residences then into treelined 
suburbs then gradually into streets of brickbuilt houses and 
shops We were in Johannesburg 
Ic stirred my heart as I rode along to realise that I was 
taking part in this great triumphal procession It was some 
thing new to enter a town prepared for siege We had passed 
scores of skilfully laid trenches oh the outlying slopes that 
had never been occupied We were now looking upon the 
preparations of the town itself for an investment that never 
came The streets were practically deserted by white people 
The British had been turned out long ago  the burghers 
were off to the war  those that remained were in the main of 
other nations with perhaps indifferent feelings  at least they 
were stolid as they gazed The Kaffirs scantily dressed sat 
at the corners and stared eagerly at the locust army 
Here and there some men and women looked from a balcony  
and a few go 3d Samaritans gave water or tea to the sick or 
the marching men But there was no sound save the tramp 
of men and the rattle of wheels and arms I do not know 
what happened when the great chief himself entered at the 
head of his splendid troops  but at our part of the column 
there were no sounds of welcome On the part of the soldiers 
there was apparently only aroused interest there were no 
cheers or jibes  the men moved on in steady stream only 
silently exultant that they were victors after long and fearful 
hardships 
The houses of business almost without exception were 
closed Huge barricades of wood or corrugated iron covered 
the windows and doors All showed what the stress of war 
can bring to a civil community 
I rode ahead along the long streets in order to reach the 
hospital The Union Jack was flying in the great square 
opposite the public buildings and half a dozen fluttered from 
as many houses That was all the bunting I saw The 
people whose sympathies were with the victors had been 
appealed to by the late official paper to curb any feeling of 
rejoicing in the hour of triumph and they certainly did not 
offend 
I got to the hospital at 5 oclock and found the resident 
medical officer to be a Dublin man Dr Pearce The building 
is really palatial and splendidly equipped in every depart 
ment Nothing could be better than the operating theatre 
There are 400 beds and the income is about 40000 a year 
The patients were received and refreshed with great prompt 
ness One of ours did not survive the tiresome march The 
nuns were most kind and the celerity with which the 
hundreds of sick and wounded were got into their comfortable 
beds was admirable For ourselves we had eaten nothing 
for nine hours and even our needs were attended to 
We left at 8 oclock for the camp Our authority told us 
that the distance was two miles I have noticed many times 
that distance is very elastic in South Africa You are told 
that you have to go two miles  you march four and become 
bewildered  then you are toldthis time trulythat yon 
have still five miles to go So it was now We struggled on 
in the dark after others on the same errand as ourselves  but 
at 12 oclock we could not find any sign of the division We 
were told it was five miles off so we outspanned till morning 
We were all thoroughly tired out We found next day that 
hundreds were in the same plight as ourselves and the 
brigade hospitals were still behind us 
In this march we have admitted to hospital 159 patients 
and many of these were sent back by convoy but we carried 
30 for several days Most of the cases were enteric and the 
wounded did not present any special feature to which I need 
allude They all did well We only lost one case of fever on 
the last days march 
Of my 3 dressers 2Dr Pounden and Mr Percy Stewart 
are in the town hospital with enteric They as well as 
nearly all the staff had been inoculated This makes 7 who 
have been attacked but in no instance was the disease 
severe 
We have had two days rest in a beautifullywooded country 
and we are ready for another march 
The Engagement outside Pretoria 
We left our camp on Sunday morning June 3rd and 
marched towards the six mile drift The enemy were strongly 
entrenched there to contest the crossing On Monday June 
4th we were early afoot but we reached the drift without 
opposition and got safely across We heard that the Boers 
had been forced out by the mounted infantry brigade early in 
the morning The road onwards led through sharply undula 
ting country with steep ascents and descents all the roads 
being exposed to commanding positions But our flanks were 
widely extended The small patches of trees were searched 
and we went on unmolested About 11 oclock I heard the 
boom of the first gun It was just ahead of our line Then 
came more firing and we knew we were at last engaged 
seriously A long climb brought us to the crest of a hill 
Right in front about a mile away I saw a battery of our guns 
on the side of a hill They were shelling a kopje about 2000 
yards in front of them and the shells fell in showers upon it 
The Guards moved off to the right  while the 18th Brigade 
moved in advance and to their left Our road here turned 
sharp to the right and the waggons moved steadily on On

the sky line a mile and ahalf away were the naval guns and 
the 18th Brigade had moved in front of these and lain down 
on the burnt veld Our orders were to bring the hospital on 
to the rear of the naval guard but on the near side of the brow 
of the slope 
Accordingly we pitched one large tent in a few minutes 
the others being drawn up at hand The firing had now 
become very heavy There was a chorus of pompoms from 
both sides punctuated by the loud booming of the naval and 
field guns and we looked with intense interest at the tragic 
work that was going on before us There was little smoke 
and that only from the big guns and bursting shells but the 
noise was deafening All I could see at this time was the 
flash of cannon a little smoke our own troops but no enemy 
They were hidden behind stone breastworks which had been 
prepared with deliberation for what was expected to be a fierce 
resistance 
The Hospital under Fire 
An ambulance returned bringing Commander de Horsey of 
the Monarchy who had been hit on the left malleolus by a shell 
splinter while bringing his 47 gun into action I was engaged 
in examining his wound when I heard the crackling shriek of 
a shell passing over the tent I looked up and saw another 
burst forty yards away Dr Kendal Franks came in just 
then and kindly assisted us in hurrying on the work A 
shell now fell between our mules and our tent waggon They 
were raining freely among the transport and I saw the drivers 
turn and lash their mules and oxen in retreat All over the 
place there were spurting columns of dust sent up by the 
bursting shells Someone had given the order for the convoy 
to retire Still the shells came They were being fired at the 
naval guns and missing these came plopping amongst us 
Once I saw a shell drop behind one of our own waggons 
which was moving away The mules jibbed and the waggon 
rolled and heaved I was sure it had been struck and 
I expected to see it fall to pieces but it was only 
rolling through a watercourse and it got away safely 
Then a soldier was brought in wounded in the face by a shell 
He had been standing outside the operation tent talking to 
one of our men when a shell burst and a fragment struck 
him badly in the face There was a big rectangular wound 
penetrating to the mouth and I stitched this up with Dr 
Franks assistance Then Colonel Magill came in and ordered 
us to retire for a mile The tent was taken down and packed 
and we hurried back to a new position where we received 
other wounded 
It was a hot quarter of an hour altogether but the only 
damage done was to the soldier At the naval guns them 
selves only one officer was wounded and two mules were 
killed 
The firing went on all day until night came The big guns 
fired at the forts at Pretoria and planted the shells un 
erringly Then the railway station was assailed and also the 
artillery barracks Once or twice the guns turned upon a 
near kopje and pounded it at 2000 yards to keep down the 
rifle fire Gradually the firing slowed and as evening fell 
silence followed 
The casualties were slight about 50 altogether Our hos 
Sital 
received the Duke of Norfolk who early in the day had 
is right hip dislocated by reason of his horse putting his 
foot in a hole The reduction was effected on the field under 
chloroform and he is doing very well 
A soldier was hit in the abdomen just below the last rib 
on the right side the bullet emerging at the left side of the 
last lumbar vertebra I had the advantage of consulting with 
Dr Franks and Dr Lowe a civil surgeon and we were unani 
mous in thinking that operation was not desirable He died 
next day In another case a man was wounded through the 
right kneejoint the bullet coming out just below the patella 
Beyond some effusion he has no trouble and the wound is 
healed 
In another case a bullet entered at the edge of Pouparts 
ligament  inch from the anterior superior spine I removed 
it from the right buttock 2 inches from the anus There were 
no symptoms In the case of a West Australian the bullet 
entered the outer margin of the right sternomastoid I re 
moved it from a point just below the occipital protuberance 
There were other cases of no special interest 
We remained by order on the field until Wednesday the 
troops having left on Tuesday The only excitement was the 
arrival of a party of Boers on their way to surrender One 
was a member of Kings Inns We gav them some lunch 
and soon after we followed them into Pretoria with our sick 
and wounded 
 Pretoria June 8th 
THE COLONIAL DIVISION UNDER BRIGADIER 
GENERAL BRABANT CMG 
By SurgeonLieutenantColonel Habtley VC 
PMO Cape Colonial Foices 
In the month of January it was considered advisable to form 
a division composed of mounted men presumably accustomed 
to South African manners and customs and led by Colonial 
officers It is not my purpose to discuss questions outside 
the medical bearings of the work done by this particular 
body of troops which was massed at Qneenstown Cape Colony 
and numbered some 3000 mounted men 
Organisation of the Medical Service 
The Imperial authorities having taken over the three vol 
unteer bearer companies of the Cape Medical Staff Corps one 
surgeon of the Cape Mounted Riflemen and the majority of 
the rank and file of the Medical Staff regulars of that regi 
ment there only remained a nucleus consisting of myself and 
one sergeantmajor to develop a medical service for this 
Colonial Division Kind friends had already subscribed a 
substantial sum for the purchase of ambulance wagons medi 
cines and medical comforts and it only remained to get them 
together and arrange them in some sort of order The general 
officer commanding also took the liveliest interest in the 
arrangements for the comfort of the sick and wounded of his 
division and was so good as to order his principal medical 
officer to spare no reasonable effort and expense towards the 
attainment of a happy result It was considered advisable to 
depart from the established custom of a distinct bearer com 
pany and field hospital and to combine the two It was 
thought from actual experience in the earlier months of the 
present war that much valuable time and material is wasted 
through men of the bearer companies being idle excepting 
when an action is taking place or at times when patients are 
required to be moved from field hospitals to hospital trains or 
ambulance wagons This is a subject which deserves the 
most earnest consideration of the War Office for future 
campaigns 
Recruits for Brabants Ambulance were advertised for in 
various colonial towns Some 80 men were collected in this 
way and an extraordinary medley they wererefugees from 
Johannesburg Germans French English Americans Jews 
etcfew if any of them having any knowledge of ambulance 
work drill or discipline But whatever their nationality or 
creed they have done admirable work both under fire in the 
field and in the hospitals There have naturally been some 
exceptions but the bad ones were soon found out and dis 
charged 
Then a more serious question arose South Africa is a very 
free country or to be absolutely correct considers itself so 
and the medical profession is not behindhand in the esti 
mation of its welldeserved freedom and resourcefulness in 
times of difficulty and emergency Finally a staff of 15 
regularly qualified medical men were engaged only one of 
them having seen active service previously but all had been 
engaged in private practice in the Cape Colony and were 
conversant with the general run of diseases of the country 
Action at Dordrecht 
The first engagements took place on February 16th and 17th 
close to the town of Dordrecht 7 being killed and 9 wounded 
A temporary hospital was formed at a deserted farmhouse 
some five miles from the town So soon as the troops took 
possession the patients were moved into it including one 
Boer wounded in the thigh who had been deserted by his 
fellow patriots and left on the field to whatever fate might 
befall him It was only necessary to perform two amputations 
one through the upper third of the thigh and the other 
through the humrus both of which recovered without a bad 
symptom 
On the second day of the fight the ambulance waggons were 
moved three times in consequence of shells and bullets fall

ing in close proximity I am bound to affirm this did not 
appear to be intentional on the part of the enemy but to be 
due rather to the fact that they were drawn up behind the 
guns which naturally attracted much attention from the 
opposite side The public school buildings afforded an 
excellent impromptu hospital it being possible from the 
numerous classrooms to keep the medical and surgical cases 
quite distinct Over one hundred patients were treated in 
this hospital until it was closed on March 14th when they 
were transferred by rail a distance of some sixty miles to 
the civil hospital at Queenstown 
Actions at Labuschanes Nek and the Orange River 
The next fight occurred at Labuschanes Nek five mile3 
from Dordrecht with 14 killed and 26 wounded The division 
next marched to Aliwal North without opposition and a sharp 
engagement took place on March nth on the banks of the 
Orange River within a mile of the town  5 killed and 18 
wounded Fortunately for all concerned there are very 
elaborate and extensive public school buildings in the town 
and within two hours of the fight these were converted into 
an admirable hospital with the ready assistance and self 
sacrificing aid of the ladies of the town They not only placed 
beds and bedding at the disposal of the medical officers but 
readily undertook the nursing day and night regardless of 
gersonal 
fatigue and inconvenience to themselves The 
olonial Division should ever feel grateful to these self 
denying ladies whose kindness and attention were most 
valuable 
About this time heavy rains took place causing a good deal 
of fever diarrhoea and dysentery among the troops The 
resources of hospital accommodation were however not 
unduly strained communication by rail to the Colony being 
reestablished thus making it easy to send suitable cases to 
the civil hospital at Queenstown 
An interesting little episode occurred at Aliwal North 
Hospital showing that the Boer is perhaps after all not so 
bad as he is usually painted A Dutchman shot through the 
head causing hemiplegia was treated by us for some weeks 
and finally his friends were allowed to take him home Before 
leaving his father presented the hospital with twenty shillings 
and sixpence as a mark of gratitude for the sons treatment 
which amount he wished expended for the benefit of our sick 
and wounded  
Wepener 
In the early part of April some 1700 men of the Colonial 
division marched to Wepener where they were immediately 
surrounded by three or four times their number of the Boer 
army who relentlessly plied them with shot and shell day 
and night for seventeen days Our men made a most gallant 
defence until they were relieved by Generals Brabant and 
Hart on April 25th As might be expected our losses were 
serious 33 men being killed and 133 wounded Six medical 
officers and a few rank and file of the ambulance corps under 
command of SurgeonMajor Faskally Cape Mounted Riflemen 
were with the beleaguered force and worked fearlessly and 
well during the whole siege A large private house which 
was unfortunately in the direct line of fire one wounded 
patient being killed in bed and another shot dead whilst 
sitting in the hospital verandah and a farmhouse about a 
mile distant formed admirable hospitals The shutting in of 
this portion of the Colonial division being totally unexpected 
the supply of dressings was wellnigh exhausted and there 
was no possibility of replenishing them until the arrival of the 
relief column The best endeavours were made to overcome 
deficiencies and no particular harm occurred as events 
turned out I was with the relief column which had two 
engagements during the march 3 men being killed and 27 
wounded the principal sufferers being the infantry of HM 
Border Regiment who with a battery of Royal Artillery and 
the Somersetshire Light Infantry had reinforced us As the 
whole of the Orange Free State was at war with the British 
Government our lines of communication with the Cape 
Colony were in an uncertain condition and the railway some 
sixty miles distant through country known to be occupied by 
the enemy it was difficult to know how to dispose of our con 
siderable number of wounded The Resident Commissioner 
of Basutoland Sir Godfrey Lagden in the most handsome 
and generous manner permitted them to be moved to Mafe 
teng and Maseru placing Churches schools dwellinghouses 
medical officers medical stores in these villages at the dis 
posal of the General Officer Commanding Colonial Division 
and the wounded have found a veritable haven of rest in this 
hospitable highland territory of Basutoland 
Temporary Hospitals at ThabaNchu Roux ville and 
Ficksburg 
Since that time this division has been marching along the 
extreme eastern border of the Orange Free State one or two 
affairs of picquets having taken place in which 3 men have 
been killed and 8 wounded I have formed small Colonial 
hospitals as occasion demanded at ThabaNchu Roux vile 
and Ficksburg These however will be abandoned as soon as 
possible being so far removed from railway communication 
with the colony and sea coast 
Relative Immunity from Typhoid Fever 
Very little disease has arisen among the Colonial troops 
only four or five deaths from enteric having taken place This 
is the more remarkable as with the exception of the per 
manent regiment of Cape Mounted Riflemen the South 
African soldier troubles himself but little about clean camps 
latrines refuse pits tidy tents or general sanitation It is 
not wise to hazard explanations of their remarkable immunity 
from disease at this stage of the war Perhaps it is they 
have been well fed and clothed have generally been under 
canvas and are constantly moving from one camp to another 
Others factors may be the Colonial man is mounted and does 
not suffer so much from thirst and fatigue as does the foot 
soldier who madly rushes to drink all and any kind of water 
however muddy and uncertain it may look to wiser and more 
experienced eyes The last and perhaps best explanation 
may be that the Colonial division is composed of men who 
have become inured to the climate through long residence in 
the country or have been rovers in America Australia and 
other Colonies Before closing these hasty notes it is in

fond of taking medicines  some 70 or 80 of the division roll

PURIFICATION OP SEWAGE AT LEICESTER 
Apparent Failure of the  
Septic System 
In a long fullyillustrated and highlyinstructive report Mr 
Mawbey MiCE Borough Engineer and Surveyor of Leices 
ter describes the difficulties and defects which exist in the 
sewage disposal of that city and gives a detailed account of a 
very interesting series of experiments in the bacteriological 
purification of sewage which were carried on from September 
2nd 1898 to October 13th 1899 
Existing System Broad Irrigation 
Hitherto the sewage of nearly the whole of the city has 
been treated after passing through a settling tank of about 
126000 cubic feet capacity by broad irrigation on about 1355 
acres of stiff clay land Owing to the increase of population 
and other causes this land has become greatly overtaxed and 
it has become imperative either to purchase a much larger 
quantity of land for the sewage farm or to adopt some method 
of purification of the sewage before applying it to the land 
Nature of Experiments 
It was decided to carry out a series of experiments in order 
to form a scheme by which the sewage might be sufficiently 
clarified before irrigation with the minimum formation of 
sludge and the maximum clarification and purification as 
gauged by the albuminoid ammonia and 
 
oxygen absorbed 
 
in the final effluent The experimental works comprised  
A A channel and weir chamber 20 feet by 4 feet for delivering and 
measuring the crude sewage 
B A detritus tank 18681 gallons watercapacity 
C A large settling tank 125962 gallons water capacity  used as a closed 
septic tank during the last four and a halfmonths of the experi 
ments 
D Four clarifying coarse first contact bacteria beds total area 
about 490 square yards average working depth of material about 4 
feei 
E Second and third contact fine bacteria beds 
F Irrigation area of old pasture and rye grass 1355 acres 
These experiments were conducted on a large and 
thoroughly practical scale about 62000 to 429000 gallons of 
fair average crude Leicester sewage per day over a period of 
13 months having been dealt with 
The processes of experiment were varied in seventeen dif 
ferent ways the chief object being to test the relative efficacy 
after passage through the detritus tank of 
a The coarse bacteria beds alone single contact  b the coarse bacteria 
beds preceded by the large open settling tank  and c the coarse bacteria 
beds preceded by the large closed 
 
septic tank before applying the re 
spective effluents obtained by these methods to the land ana d the 
coarse bacteria beds followed by fine bacteria beds double and treble 
contact without any application to the land 
These experiments distinctly show that the Leicester sewage 
when passed from the detritus tank through the coarse bac 
teria bed and finally over one plot of pasture land that is 
without any preliminary anaerobic treatment produces a final 
effluent which compares favourably with all the effluents ob 
tained by the other processes employed in the course of the 
investigation 
Kesults and Conclusions 
This process was carried on for about 7J months The 
analyses of the crude sewage and final effluent from the land 
during this period show the followiug averages in grains per 
gallon

This final effluent from the pasture land was perfectly 
bright clear and free from smell producing no discoloration 
or fouling of the grass and dykes through which it passed 
and developing no afterputrefaction 
From a study of Mr Mawbeys report it is evident that he 
is justified in forming the following conclusions  
i That the process of purification of the Leicester sewage 
by bacteria beds previous to land irrigation would be far 
more efficient than large extension at great cost of the 
sewa2ing area 
2 That the 
 
septic system is not adapted 
 
for clarifica 
tion before direct application to old pasture land or rye 
grass 
The final effluent obtained by this process was not greatly 
inferior to the best  but the foulness of the effluent from the 
septic tank itself and the pollution of the land grass etc 
which it caused was most offensive and intolerable We are 
not aware however that the direct application of a septic 
tank effluent to land by irrigation has ever been advocated by 
the promoters of the 
 
septic System 
3 That the most efficient clarification combined with the 
greatest percentage purification in albuminoid ammonia and 
oxygen absorbed and with the least production cf sludge has 
been achieved by a detritus tank and clarifying bacteria beds 
and the effluent from this process has been found to be in a 
more ripe condition for rapid final nitrification than the moro 
anaerobic preliminary processes included in the experi 
ments 
I So far as the Leicester sewage is concerned the septio 
system 
 
appears to have proved a failure It is true that the 
effluent from the septic tank showed a very considerable reduc 
tion in the albuminoid ammonia and the 
 
oxygen absorbed 
from about 40 up to more than 60 per cent but the effluent 
from the bacteria bed without the aid of any septic tank was 
practically as good as when the septic tank was used in 
addition 
Moreover the amount of sludge deposited in the tank was 
excessive It amounted to no less than 14924 tons after 125 
days use of the tank and was intolerably offensive This 
amount according to calculation is equivalent to 704 tons of 
sludge with 90 per cent of water per million gallons of 
sewage 
These results produced by the 
 
septic system at Leicester 
are of great interest and call for careful consideration It will 
be well to compare them with results produced elsewhere 
under apparently similar conditions 
Results op Experiments at Manchester 
In the report on the treatment of Manchester sewage issued 
at the end of last year the experts after their prolonged and 
careful experiments stated that the results obtained by the 
bacterial system of sewage purification exceeded their anticipa 
tions and also that in order that a bacterial contact bed may 
exercise its full powers of purification a preliminary anaerobic 
or septic process is necessary 
They found that by the 
 
septic system constructed on the 
wellknown Exeter model closed septic tank followed by 
single contact bacteria beds a highly satisfactory effluent 
was obtained and a still purer effluent by the open septic 
tank followed by double contact beds No mention is mad o 
in their report of offensive effluvia  whilst great reduction in 
the amount of sludge by the septic tanks is recorded 
Cause of Apparent Failure of Septic System at 
Leicester 
The question of chief interest is why a system which ha 
pucceeded elsewhere has apparently failed at Leicester The 
Leicester sewage according to the analyses reported is not an 
excessively strong one It is not complicated by such a 
quantity of strong trade effluents as the Manchester sewage 
For these reasons it might have been expected that the septic 
system would have answered as well at Leicester as at Man 
chester 
The explanation of this question is possibly to be found in 
the fact that at Leicester the crude sewage has undergone 
excessive anaerobic action before it reaches the septic tank 
Scott Moncrieff has demonstrated that excessive septic 
change may be highly detrimental to the aerobic organisms 
I and entirely prohibit the final oxidation of the organic 
I ingredients o sewage
