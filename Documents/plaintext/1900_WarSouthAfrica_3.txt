THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE RELIEF OF LADYS3IITH 
By Frederick Trves FwRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Forces 
Durban March 9th 1900 
The Fifteendays Battle 
No 4 Stationary Field Hospital reached Chieveley on 
Sunday February nth after a very tedious march during 
which we felt the heat severely The heat on the two 
following days was intense and on Wednesday February 
14th I watched the army moving out for the fourth time 
The men were not in the best of spirits and had not for 
gotten the circumstances under which Colenso was ap 
proached on the last occasion On Thursday February 15th 
firing began and from that day until Thursday March ist 
there was fighting every day and all day There is no 
doubt that these fourteen days represent the very hardest 
part of the campaign The men were moving forward 
through a terrible country and as soon as one ridge or 
kopje had been taken another had to be faced There was 
seldom a night during which we did not hear rifle firing 
This in most cases came from the Boers who were in 
constant terror of a night attack and would fire furiously 
from their trenches on the least alarm The casualties 
during these fourteen days were comparatively few 
but among them were many serious cases The men 
moreover were exhausted by the continued fighting and 
were often lyiDg out for some time before they could be 
reached by the stretcherbearers Thus many were lying 
out all night and one man I talked to was unfortunately 
out two nights and a day The Boers gave him water to 
drink and at the same time relieved him ofall he had on 
him 
Wounds Produced by Expanding Bullets 
If was during these fourteen days that we began to have 
experience of 
 
explosive 
 
bullets The wounds made by 
bullets so named are easily recognised They are marked 
by a small point of entrythe usual Mauser woundand 
by a large and terrific wound of exit This wound may 
form an open cavity as large in diameter as halfa crown 
At the same time there is great shattering of the bone 
As certain statements as to the extensive use of explosive 
bullets by the Boers have appeared in newspapers from 
time to time it may be well to state precisely what has been 
the experience gained among our wounded In the first 
place practically all the wounded who have fallen in the 
Natal campaign from the Battle of Colenso December 15th 
to the Relief of Lady smith have passed through the Field 
Hospital to which I have been attached The only excep 
tions are represented by some few convoys of 
wounded mostly slight cases who Twent down to the 
base direct by ambulance train We have therefore 
dealt with some thousands of instances of shot and 
shell iDJury At the first battle of Colenso and at 
Spearmans Camp we met with isolated instances in which 
the injury was probably due to a MartiniHenry bullet or 
to a missile from a  
sporting rifle In these cases how 
ever the lesion was marked by a comparatively large point 
of entry and was hardly typical Some may have been due 
to explosive bullets but it was not until after February 
15th that I came aeross examples of injury due undoub 
tedly to bullets of this type We have admitted a good 
many instances of these particular wounds although the 
proportion among the whole number of the wounded is 
quite small Moreover a large quantity of softnosed 
bullets have been found among the ammunition left by the 
Boers in their flight I have myself found many on my 
visits to the Boer trenches and am bringing specimens 
home 
The Green Bullets 
I am also bringing back a box or so of  
poisoned bullets  
as 
our soldiers call them found among the Boer ammunition 
These bullets are covered with a bright green composition 
I do not for a moment suppose they are  
poisoned The 
coating appears to me to be a mixture of sulphate of 
copper and tallow and is probably used to keep the rifle 
barrel clear I propose to have this green material ex 
amined chemically when I return to London I have turned 
over many heaps of Mauser ammunition in the Boer rifle 
pits and trenches but have found no examples of the split 
or decapitated bullets which have been picked up by some 
They must I think beuncommon We have not met with 
any in No 4 Hospital 
Vagaries of Bullets 
The vagaries of bullets are apparently without end I 
have seen now several instances of wound of the prostate 
and base of the bladder both with communication with the 
bowel and without When the prostate has been involved 
epididymitis has not been uncommon In one or two in 
stances of abdominal wound a faecal fistula has followed 
without any peritonitis We have had several cases in 
which isolated nerve trunks have been cut across without 
other injury In a case under the care of Dr Elliot the 
Mauser penetrated the lower end of the thigh wounding 
the popliteal artery and causing a fracture of the femur 
which involved the kneejoint A large traumatic 
aneurysm followed with great swelling of the whole limb 
The kneejoint was filled with blood which showed a visible 
pulsation This case was treated by rest and elevation 
and when last seen was doing well Certain traumatic 
aneurysms with distinct and widespread pulsation have 
vanished with rest 
Five Bullet Wounds in the same Engagement 
As an instance of extensiva Mauser wounds I may men 
tion the case of an officer recently in 
 
No 4 His ex 
perience p I imagine unique He was shot in an engage 
ment and fell He rose and tried to walk towards a fellow 
officer He was again shot and fell He got up and made 
a second attempt to move when he was shot a third time 
He could move no more and when lying on the ground 
was shot a fourth time In due course the stretcher 
bearers arrived and as he was being carried down he was 
shot a fifth time and one of his bearers was shot at the 
same moment so that his stretcher was dropped to the 
ground Of the five injuries four involved the limbs and 
back The third wound received was a penetrating wound 
of the abdomen below the level of the umbilicus the bullet 
escaping apparently at the buttock The poor fellow was 
much collapsed on admission had some abdominal pain some tympanites and slight vomiting Following the indi 
cations taught by this campaign I advised no operation 
He made an excellent recovery thanks largely to his 
pluck and fine health and the care of his surgeon Major 
Kirkpatrick 
A Maxim Bullet 
I may here mention that I have seen only one intact 
Maxim bullet extracted The man was under Dr Elliots 
care The bullet caused a long gutter fracture of the skull 
in the temporal region opened the meatus and was cut 
out in the neck near the clavicle There was a considerable 
escape of brain matter The bullet was detected by the 
telephone probe 
The Trenches on Fort Wylie 
On Sunday February 25th I paid a visit to the Boer 
trenches on the north side of Colenso and was especially 
interested in the entrenched hill called Fort Wylie This 
kopje WS literally covered with burst shell and with 
shrapnel bullets On the face towards the river almost 
every stone showed a mark of lead The Boer trenches on the other hand contained such a quantity of empty 
Mauser cartridge cases that it is evident the enemy had 
not  een inactive on this historic hill  The trenches were

BELIEF OF 
LADYSM1THjiSinSS 3 
wide and beautifully made and were nearly neck deep 
In some the earth had been scooped out in front so as to 
form a retreat when a shell burst The Boers had in all 
cases provided the trenches with a means of escape and 
had made elaborate attempts to ensure some comfort In 
many trenches there was straw and in one an iron bed 
stead Among the dbris in the trenches I was struck by 
the strange number of patent medicine bottles They 
were almost as numerous as the gin bottles The Boers 
had provided themselves with ingenious coverings against 
the rain but they left behind the impression that they had 
little regard for cleanliness 
Colenso Village 
The pretty little village of Colenso was represented by a 
woebegone street of brokenuD and ruined houses There 
was not a sound pane of glass in the place In one ruined 
cottage the sole relic of the time of peace was a childs 
battledore The railway station was little injured but was 
Tendered unattractive by the fact that the Boers had left a 
dead horse in the booking office The animal had been 
long deceased Colenso railway bridge with its fine spans 
was a fantastic ruin a chaos of broken iron hurled into 
the rushing stream a mere muddle of bent beams hanging 
tolts and twisted bars Some precarious planks placed 
from one piece of wreckage to another formed the sole 
means of crossing the Tugela on the day of my visit Not 
long after I had left this muchdeserted village the Boers 
began to shell it again from Groblers Kloof Poor Colenso  
Through all the glorious days of the summer now passing 
away there has been little but death and riot among the 
gardens which made the sleepy hamlet homely and among 
the cactus and the mimosa which made it beautiful 
The Storming of Pieters Hill 
 Late on the afternoon of February 27th we were able to 
view from our camp at Chieveley the grandest spectacle of 
this campaignthe storming of Pieters Hill The hill 
formed a long ridge or series of ridges immediately in front 
of Umbulwana The afternoon was a little cloudy but a wide 
patch of sunshine rested upon this fateful ridge and made 
it luminous against the gloomy walls of Umbulwana A 
more terrific display of artillery fire could hardly be 
imagined It was incessant The sound was as the roar 
of some uncanny sea The air above the ridge was alive 
with the little white clouds of shrapnel and on the 
ground itself were flashing lyddite and common shell and 
brown columns of dust which rose up and were made 
brilliant by the sun When the artillery ceased the rifle 
fire could be heard and later on we knew that the trenches 
had been taken at the point of the bayonet and that the 
way to Lady smith was open 
The Journey to Ladysmith 
About 6 pm on Wednesday February 28th our cavalry 
reached Ladysmith and on Thursday March ist General 
Buller reached the longbeleaguered camp On the follow 
ing day Friday I had the good fortune to enter the town 
My journey to Ladysmith was not accomplished without 
difficulty I had to follow the road the army had taken 
as the main road was not known to be free from th 
enemy and moreover the bridge leading to it had been 
blown up The distance from Chieveley to Ladysmith by 
the route I took was between 23 and 24 miles I took my 
covered cart called in the camp the bus with ten 
mules and two of my Kaffir boys My servant rode in front 
to pick out the road With me came my remaining nurse 
Miss McCauland Mr Day an army chaplain MissMcCaul 
was the first woman to enter Ladysmith after the siege 
We took provisions water and forage for two days We 
left Chieveley at 630 am and the first part of the journey 
was over the battlefield of Colenso We came across the 
skeletons of Colonel Longs horses the horses attached to 
the lost guns  they were lying in a line as they felJ their 
bones were whitened but still attached to them were the 
collars and harness The road now became very rough over ridges and down into dongas over boulders and deep 
into ruts  now the mules would be at a fair trot and now 
they would be dragged to a standstill At last we reached 
the hill commanding the pontoon bridge over the Tugela 
At the top of this precipitous height was the mighty con 
voy of ox waggons with food for Lad y smith The waggons 
could be counted by hundreds and the cattle by thousands 
The hubbub could not be surpassed The lowing of the 
oxen the shrieking of the Kaffir boys the bellowed orders 
of the convoy conductors the groaning of colliding wag 
gons made a compound of sound worthy of the scene 
Among the rabble would be seen ambulance waggons 
water carts isolated gun carriages and ammunition 
wag 
gons bread carts mounted officers hurrying through 
weary pickets returning to camp and a few 
 
Tommies 
 
tramping along with a cheery indifference to the restless 
struggling crowd Owing to the kindness of the staff 
officer I was able to get my cart over the pontoon without 
delay 
Crossing the Tugela 
The actual road above the pontoon was the very steepest 
declivity I have ever seen negotiated by structures on 
wheels In England it would no doubt be indicated by a 
placard 
 This hill is fatal to cyclists The bus empty of all occupants slid unsteadily down the incline rocking 
like a ship in a troubled sea and the mules had to put on 
their best pace to keep clear of the onrushing wheels 
The river at the point of crossing is exceedingly pic 
turesque The steep rugged banks are rendered beautiful 
by mimosa and cactus and below the pontoons the torrent 
breaks into foaming rapids while upstream is the cele 
brated waterfall of the Tugela From the river the road 
wound on of its own sweet will to the foot of Umbulwana 
It ran across plains and down into valleys and over 
spruits and across boulders and through mimosa groves 
and over dusty wastes We had to ford a river at the foot 
of the great hill and as the mules were nearly carried off 
their feet and our waggon was flooded with the stream we 
were glad to land on the opposite bank We were by this 
time many miles ahead of the slowmoving food convoy 
and had the advantage of seeing the country undisturbed 
Boer Camps 
We passed the Boer camps which showed every evidence 
of a hurried departure The cooking pots were still on the 
camp fires  the rude shelters under which our hardy enemy had lived were still intact The ground was strewn with 
refuse with the remains of the last meal with discarded 
articles of clothing with empty bottles and barrels with 
fragments of chairs and tables with empty flour sacks and 
above all with the straw which is quite a feature of a Boer 
settlement There were no tents The shelters were made 
of boughs of beams of wood from adjacent farms of iron 
railings of barbed wire of plates of corrugated iron and of 
casual patches of canvas and of old sacks In some of the 
trenches the shelters were very elaborate and varied from 
an almost shotproof retreat to a simple tent made out of 
two raw cow skins stretched over bamboos These wild 
camps amid a still wilder country suggested a brigands 
stronghold and inheed one could not help being frequently 
reminded of certain familiar theatrical scenes which pro 
fessed to represent the conventional brigands retreat 
The only evidences of a gentler mood were provided by a 
discarded concertina and by a letter I picked up on the 
road side The letter was from a Boer wife at the home 
farm to her husband in the trenches As we passed along 
the road we met with many evidences of a hurried flight 
The dead horses were very numerous and left by the road 
side with traces cut were carts light spider carts water 
carts waggons and such cumbrous impedimenta as wheel 
barrows and a smiths forge One waggon had fallen head 
long into a donga in the dark and was an utter wreck 


84 iJlBS55JTHE 
BELIEF OF LADYSMITH Aim 7 ioo 
The First Sight of Ladysmith 
At last on mounting the summit of a little ridge we saw 
before us a wide green plain of waving grass and beyond 
the plain and under the shelter of purple hills lay the 
unhappy town of Ladysmith Ladysmith looks very 
Sretty 
at the distancea cluster of white and red roofs 
otted about among trees and surmounted by the white 
tower of the Town Hall The military camps were placed 
at various points about the town 
The Garrison 
The first of these camps we reached was that of the 
gallant Kings Royal Rifles They had made some sort of 
home for themselves on the side of a barren and stony 
hill They had of course no tents but had fashioned all 
sorts of fantastic shelters out of stone and wood and wire 
They had even burrowed into the ground and had re 
turned to the type of habitation common to primeval 
man Among the huts and burrows were many paths 
worn smooth by the restless tread of weary feet The 
path the most worn of all was that which led to the water 
tanks The men themselves were piteous to see They 
were thin and holloweyed and had about them an air of 
utter lassitude and weariness Some were greatly 
emaciated nearly all were pale nearly all were silent 
They had exhausted every topic of conversation it would 
seem and were too feeble to discuss even their relief 
I reached Ladysmith at 230 pm and the food convoy 
did not arrive until late the same evening so we had the 
sad opportunity of seeing Ladysmith still unrelieved 
unrelieved so far as the misery of hunger was concerned 
I had no food at my disposal but I had fortunately a good 
quantity of tobacco which I doled out in pipefuls so long 
as the supply lasted It would have taken many pounds 
however to satisfy the eager wasted trembling hands 
which were thrust forward on the chance of getting a 
fragment of the weed We outspanned at the outskirts of 
the town and the first person to come up to me was a 
skeleton of a Kaffir who offered me a shilling while he 
pointed repeatedly to his mouth He was really starving 
and devoured the biscuits I gave him like a wolf There 
is no doubt that the coloured people left in Ladysmith 
have suffered very severely 
Starvation City 
The town is composed almost entirely of singlestoreyed 
houses built of corrugated iron with occasional walls of 
brick or cement In the suburbs of the town these houses 
are made as villalike as possible by means of verandahs 
and flower gardens and creepers The main street of the 
town however has no pretensions to beauty and is 
merely a broad road with corrugated iron shops on either 
side On walking into Starvation City ones first 
impression was that of the utter emptiness of the place 
Most of the villas were unoccupied were closed up and 
indeed barricaded The gardens were neglected and 
everything had run wild The impression of desolation 
was accentuated by an occasional house with a hole in its 
roof or its wall due to a Boer shell All the people we 
met were pallid and holloweyed and many were wasted 
All were silent listless and depressed There were no 
evidences of rejoicing no signs of interest or animation 
and indeed as I have just said Ladysmith was still un 
relieved Nearly every shop was closed or even barricaded 
Signboards showed that here was a coach builder and 
there a grocer The chemists shop appeared to be empty 
of everything except the coloured water in the large bottles 
in the window Such shops as were open were dark and 
desolate 
These were many grim evidences of better days Thus 
one restaurant presented among other cheery signs the 
announcement of 
 
Meals at all hours Another establish 
memt was gay with placards of 
 
Ice creams Notices of  
groceries of all kinds for sale made radiant a shop which i 
was empty of everything but a table and seme rough 
chairs 
Such was the aspect of the weary town Streets empty 
of all but a few tired and listless men stores without 
goods shops without customers a railway station without 
passengers a post office without letters stamps or post 
cards No words indeed can fully describe this city of 
desolation this little colony of the almost hopeless this 
poor battered wornout hungry town of Lady smith with 
a bright summer sun making mockery of its dismal streets 
The wretchedness of the place was not mitigated by the 
horrible smells which greeted one at every corner nor by 
the miserable dirty river which crawled slimily through 
the place 
The Eeturn Journey 
We left the town about 5 pm and met on our way bacfe 
the long convoy of waggons with food It was dark when 
we reached the river by Umbulwana and as it was danger 
ous and indeed impossible to cross the rift except in day 
light we outspanned by the river bank and made a pre 
tence of sleeping When yet it was dark on the following 
morning the mules were put in and with the earliest streak 
of dawn we crossed the river and made for Colenso The 
waggons were still toiling onwards towards Ladysmith 
The road as I have said was very rough and my poor 
cart which had served me well for three months began to 
show signs of giving out It broke down at last one of the 
wheels coming to pieces We were then some seven miles 
from Colenso and the vehicle was beyond all repair So it 
was left by the road side among other wreckage a forlorn 
relic of what was once a smart 
 
bus Our very canty 
luggage was packed upon the mules backs our remaining 
food was distributed among the passersby and we pro 
ceeded to walk to Colenso The mules with my servant 
kept to the road but we walked along the railway There 
was a blazing sun and the walk was tedious The line took 
us through a district where fighting had been very heavy 
and we were all the way sickened by the hideous smell of 
numerous dead horses and of still more numerous dead 
and imperfectly buried Boers The hill sides and the very 
line presented the cases of countless shells here was a 
huge yellow hole in the ground due to our lyddite and 
there was a rail bent and contorted by a blow from a solid 
shell Cartridge cases heaps of ammunition empty meat 
tins strewed the way and on each side of the line were 
graves marked usually by a wooden cross where our 
gallant men were buried 
By good fortune a trolly came along and the men in 
charge of it kindly gave Miss McCaul a lift for the last five 
miles The line was however broken in so many places 
that the trolly did not reach Colenso railway bridge many 
minutes before we did At each break the trolly had to be 
lifted aoross From Colenso we travelled to Chieveley by 
a casual goods train sitting on the floor of an open truck 
as there was no guards van We reached Chieveley on 
Saturday at 1 pm very tired and very dirty 
Siege Rations 
I have made no mention of the life of the besieged at 
Ladysmith of their strange food of their remarkable 
messes of their numerous sick and of the way they spent 
their time All this will have been fully recorded in the 
daily papers We saw the lump of bread made from 
mealies and starch which constituted a ration and were 
willing to believe that an excellent blancmange was made 
out of starch and violet powder 
A Good Samaritan 
I may mention one incident of our Ladysmith journey 
which will serve to explain why the Kaffirs are attached 
to the English and very anxious for our success 
On returning from Ladysmith we bivouacked on Friday 
night near the drift as I have already mentioned The 
night was dark and just before we turned in a conductor

of an ox waggona sturdy Scotchmanfound his way to 
my bus to ask if any of us  knew anything of doctoring 
 
as one of his Kaffir boys had been ridden over I at once 
went off with a lantern I found the  
boy 
 under the 
shelter of a waggon naked but for his loin cloth He had 
been crushed by a passing team and some four of his ribs 
were broken I asked for something to bind him up with 
but there was nothing not even an empty sack or a piece 
of carvas I suggested a shirt whereupon the conductor

Oh if you want a shirt here is one

proceeded to divest himself of his own flannel shirt I 
bound this round the  
boy 
 and made him comfortable 
while the goodhearted conductor spent the whole of a very 
chilly night with nothing on his shoulders but a thin drill 
coat Only those who know how bleak the South African 
night often feels after a scorching day can appreciate the 
kindness of this Good Samaritan 
THE IRISH HOSPITAL 
By Sir William Thomson 
Chief Surgeon 
Naauwpoort March 12th 1900 
The stay at Capetown due to the congested state of the rail 
way traffic came to an end on March 8th The Hospital 
Corps started by train at halfpast five carrying a few waggons 
and leaving the mules to be carried forward in a day or two 
The journey lasted just fifty hours In that time we travelled 
by successive climbs to a height of 4884 feet where a portion 
of our hospital is now encamped The country through which 
we passed gave one an idea of the difficulties which the 
troops have had to contend with People at home are apt to 
think of a war carried on over practically smooth plains with 
here and there a ridge but for the first 400 miles of the 
journey we were always passing through mountains and 
abrupt small hills or kopjes covered on their slopes with 
huge bare boulders or presenting a precipitous face almost 
as straight as if it had been cut The space of level ground 
between was no more than a mile often it was less and this 
looked in colour and consistence like sea sand in which had 
been planted at varying intervals small shrubs about a foot 
or eighteen inches high Approaching De Aar and after 
wards to this place the aspect changed There were fewer 
hills and larger spaces These sometimes stretched for 
twenty or thirty miles almost fiat showing as one glanced 
along the surface of the scrub the appearance of some fer 
tility But of grass there was none not more than there is on 
a wellused macadamised road until we got into a region 
where rain had recently fallen Then we found the young 
grass just giving a flash of green over what had a day before 
been sunscorched sand 
We pitched our camp yesterday near No 6 General Hospital 
which is under the command of Colonel Large RAMC The 
position is not ideal but it is the best to be had for the pre 
sent By noon ten large marquees were up and we were 
having a wellearned rest when a telegram came from Lord 
Kitchener asking that a section should be sent at once to De 
Aar Our boxes were still unopened  a great deal of personal 
baggage and stores had not arrived but we set to work with a 
will Everyone wanted to go and I finally selected Dr 
George Stoker second surgeon  Mr Friel fourth surgeon  
with Dr Counihan and Mr MacElwaine and fifteen hos 
pital orderlies and drivers Everything was soon ready and 
the party left by train at 930 the officers travelling in the 
guards van and the men in open wagons They had a wild 
send off from their comrades 
This section consists of five ambulance waggons drawn by 
strong mule teams which we brought out from Ireland A 
few square bell tents are carried but the officers and men only 
took great coats and blankets They will be attached to a 
quicklymoving force the destination of which you will know 
before this reaches home 
There remains here even after this depletion tent accom 
modation for 100 patients and in a day or two we shall be 
fully occupied All the staff are in excellent health but the 
heat is very trying 
NOTES ON THE WOUNDED FROM PAARDE 
BERG 
By G H Makins FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon to the Force in South Africa 
Capetown March 13th 1900 
Changed Character op the Wounds 
The hospitals both at Wynberg and Rondebosch have been 
very full since the battle at Paardeberg and the subsequent 
advance of Lord Robertss army There have been material 
changes in the nature of a large proportion of the wounds and 
the aftercourse has also been unfavourably modified as a re 
sult of the less satisfactory possibilities of transport dependent 
on the departure of the troops from the immediate vicinity of 
the railway 
Transport Difficulties 
With the advance of the troops the exigencies of transport 
led to the cutting down of the number of ambulance waggons 
to each field hospital to two only hence almost the only 
means of transport for the sick has been by ox waggons often 
with insufficient covering Beyond this the various battalions 
have been so widely disposed that it has been necessary to 
keep patients in camp one or two days before they could reach 
hospital The journey by ox waggon from Paardeberg to 
Modder River takes three days and although this journey is 
short compared with that which wounded men often have to 
undergo on foreign service none the less its effects are suffi 
ciently obvious in the case of many of the wounds Thus 
hsematothorax has certainly been much more common after 
chest wounds than was the case earlier in the campaign and 
again suppuration of the wounds has been more frequent 
Wounds by Expanding Bullets 
The other marked difference has been the larger proportion 
of wounds apparently the effect of expanding bullets Although 
few bullets of this nature have been extracted large quan 
tities have been found amongst the captured ammunition 
and there can be no doubt that they have been largely used 
Such wounds have naturally been most striking in connection 
with fractures I have seen several in which a typical Mauser 
wound of entry had opposite to it an exit wound as large as 
2J in by 3I in with extruded muscle everted torn skin edges 
and great disorganisation of the limb Beyond these how 
ever many wounds involving the soft parts only have ex 
 hibited similar characters quite foreign to any ordinary Mauser 
or Martini wound Hence primary amputations have been 
slightly more numerous and as a result of the increased diffi 
culty of keeping such wounds eleaa suppuration has been 
more common 
Wounds in the Early Stage of Enteric Fever 
Another recent complication may be mentionednamely 
the occurrence of wounds in men during the initial stage of 
enteric fever Several subjects of slight and some of serious 
wounds have proved on observation to be suffering from thiB 
disease and in one case death has resulted Notwithstand 
ing these difficulties however the general progress of the 
wounded may still be regarded as highly satisfactory 
A WEEKS WORK IN A FIELD HOSPITAL 
The following account will give a very good idea of work at 
the front after a trying march  
The field hospital left Modder River on February ioth pro 
ceeding by rail to Eslin and then by route march to Graspan  
next day to Ramsdam thence to Waterfall Farm arriving at 
the Reit River at noon and crossing the drift about 9 pm 
On February 14th the hospital marched at 1 am reaching 
Wegdraai Drift at 10 am and left same evening at 5 to Klip 
Drift where in heavy rain it halted and bivouacked 
On February 15th the hospital crossed the drift at 8 am and 
encamped on the north bank of Modder River Next day it 
recrossed and bivouacked till 3 am and Lthen marched to 
Klip Kraal resting there a few hours 
On February 17th at 5 pm the hospital marched towards 
Paardeberg arriving at daybreak of February 18th in sight of 
the enemy who were holding a position on the north bank of 
the river 
The action commenced soon after daybreak on February 


866 SaESSd THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE April 7 1900 
18th The field hospital was pitched in rear of a battery 
of artillery which was shelling the Boer position During 
the day wounded were continually being brought in 
and several operations were performed in the operating 
tent dressings applied etc until between 4and 5 pm hospi 
tal work had to cease as the enemy had taken possession of a 
hill some 500 yards from it and were opening a heavy rifle fire 
on our mounted infantry who were passing in detachments on 
the further side of the hospital A distant Boer battery also 
opened fire and shells fell close to the hospital on either side 
but luckily no damage was done as they did not explode 
The rifle fire however was sweeping through the tents so 
that the position was untenable and it was necessary to re 
move the wounded to aplace of safety Accordingly the 
most serious cases were placed in ambulances and hospital 
waggons  those who could walk did so and the remainder 
were carried by R AMC officers and men on stretchers The 
hospital tents had to be abandoned 
By the time the tents were evacuated it was getting dark  
and after carrying the wounded a distance of between two 
and three miles it was necessary to bivouac in the open A 
serious misfortune had happened earlier in the daythe loss 
of the hospital water carts which had been captured by the 
enemy when sent to fill at the river The wounded suffered 
considerably on that account as well as through the discom 
fort of lying in the open At daylight however it was found 
possible to carry the whole of the wounded two had died in 
the night some two miles further to the river bank and for 
tunately some milk was procured from a kraal not far off An 
officer of the West Riding Regiment had given valuable 
assistance in carrying the wounded by placing 25 of his men 
at the disposal of the RAMC The tents and one water cart 
were subsequently recovered 
The following figures show the number of men treated in 
this hospital during the week ending February 23rd  
Admitted  Officers 15 of whom 13 were wounded 
 Men 267  231  12 deaths 
Of these 5 officers and 136 men were sent to the nearest 
stationary hospital others were discharged to duty and 90 
wounded men remained till well enough to proceed also 
towards the base 
As regards the nature of the wounds the following details 
are interesting all were rifle wounds  
Head face and neck  Officers 3 men 22 1 fatal 
Chest   2  14 
Abdomen   2  13 6 fatal 
Back and spine     15 3 fatal

WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE 
From an Occasional Correspondent 
Medical Cases 
On the whole the health of the troops in Natal has been 
excellent since the war began Only three diseases have 
been at all prevalentnamely diarrhoea dysentery and 
simple continued fever The two former are perhaps the 
most preventable of diseases Carefully guard against 
rbdominal chills and especially against chills during sleep 
and diarrhoea and dysentery will cease to give trouble 
Unfortunately this is what the soldier will not and often 
cannot do The admissionrate for diarrhoea and dysentery 
has therefore been high In the treatment of the latter 
ipecacuanha sine emetine tincturewhich is the only pre 
paration of the drug supplied in the field medical panniers 
has been found practically useless By far the best results 
both in diarrhoea and dysentery have been obtained from a 
mixture containing liq hydrarg perchlor 5j and tinct opii 
mx an exclusively milk diet only being allowed 
Simple continued fever is almost always the result of 
exposure to the direct rays of the sun The temperature 
ranges from 1020 to 104o or more and persists for five or six 
days when the cases generally end with critical sweating 
Antipyrin while the temperature remains high and quinine 
later on give the best results 
Surgical Cases 
In quite 40 per cent of the wounded the lower extremities 
were involved a preponderance which is certainly remark 
able As the cases reached the field hospitals they were 
quickly examined When the wounds were slight and the 
original dressings clean and well appliedwhich happened in 
a large proportion of casesthey were not disturbed If dis 
placed bloodstained or otherwise soiled they were removed 
The wounds were then thoroughly washed with perchloride 
solution i in 1000 covered thickly with sal alembroth wool 
and firmly bandaged In probably 10 per cent of the cases 
one of the long bones was fractured most frequently the 
femur In several instances both bones of the leg were 
fractured by bullets which passed transversely through the 
limb When the fractures were caused by rifle bullets little 
if any comminution occurred These cases were invariably 
put up in splints and were at once despatched to the base 
Many interesting cases of perforating wounds of the head 
occurred several of which did well without any operation 
In the field hospital under the command of Major G H 
Younge were two cases in which a Mauser bullet had entered 
at the vertex and had passed downwards and slightly 
forwards through the brain the orbit and the hard 
palate In both there was extensive extravasation of 
blood into the orbit Both cases were treated simply 
with boric dressings and when they left for the base 
the patients were perfectly conscious and rational and free 
from head symptoms Uncomplicated wounds of the lung dioY 
remarkably well many of the patients having apparently 
recovered in a week In many cases however the bullets 
passed from above downwards involving both the chest andr 
abdomen Such cases were invariably fatal The experience 
gained in the present campaign will probably greatly modify 
opinion as to the necessity for laparotomy in gunshot wounds 
of the abdomen A number of perforating wounds have 
recovered completely without operation and the impression 
is steadily gaining ground that symptoms of internal haemor 
rhage alone call imperatively for an immediate operation There 
can be little doubt that since the action at Colenso some at 
 
least of the Boers have taken to using explosive bullets A 
number of cases were seen at the battle of Spion Kop which 
clearly demonstrated this The wounds of entrance were 
blackened with burnt powder whilst the wounds of exit were 
torn and lacerated and from 3 to 4 inches in diameter 
The Royal Army Medical Corps 
The conduct of the RAMC since the campaign began and 
the success of the entire medical arrangements in South Africa 
are the best answers to the hostile criticisms which have been 
hurled at the Department during recent years The critics 
stated that the officers only asked for military rank and titles 
so that they might sink their profession and strut in borrowed 
plumes An overwhelming answer is now 
forthcoming  since 
the commencement of the war the Corps has steadily come 
to the front until at the present moment it stands acknow 
ledged by the verdict of every officer in South Africa whose 
opinion is worthy of notice as the only really efficient branch 
of the service excepting only the Army Service 
Corps 
The 
bestowal of substantive rank has been more than justified 
The opinions of medical officers are now listened to with 
respect and carry a weight which was formerly unknown 
For this reason the Medical Department in South Africa has 
succeeded to a degree which its keenest wellwishers had 
hardly dared to hope and would have been impossible under 
the old regime With one or two further concessionssuch 
for instance as the granting of independent transportsthe 
Corps will I believe become a model one which other 
branches of the service might well try to emulate Apart 
altogether from professional skill the officers of the Corps have 
shown a degree of physical courage which could not be ex 
celled At the battle of Colenso Major W Babtie CMG 
RAMC rode through a hail of bullets close up to the Boer 
trenches to succour men of the Royal Artillery who lay 
wounded and exposed to the enemys fire At Spion Kop 
Captain E M Morphew RAMC braved the hottest fire 
from the Boer trenches and returned time after time to the 
fighting line when to show oneself for a moment meant almost 
certain death to collect and dress men who were wounded 
On the second day of the battle of Vaal Krantzr the rear 
guard with the transport field hospitals and bearer com 
panies were packed behind a steep ridge Suddenly the Boer  
Long Tom  
began to drop shells into the position and a

movement of unsteadiness became perceptible Major G H 
Younge RAMC restored confidence by the ingenious 
device of sitting down in an open space and taking a razor 
from his haversack quietly proceeded to shave himself By 
the time the operation was completed 
 
Long Tom 
 
had been 
silenced by the naval guns and complete confidence was 
restored 
Bearer Companies 
The experience gained in the present war shows that radical 
changes are necessary in the constitution of bearer companies 
At present these are independent units quite separate from 
the field hospitals As soon as the work of collecting 
wounded is over the establishment consisting of 3 officers and 
58 noncommissioned officers and men remains idle until the 
next action which may be a matter of weeks or even months 
Thus a valuable supply of trained officers rand men is kept in 
idleness whilst oftentimes the field hospitals are greatly over 
worked The only rational way out of this difficulty is to 
make the bearer companies an integral part of the field hos 
pital The officer commanding the latter would then be enabled 
to detail by roster officers and men for duty with the former 
when an action was impending and could at other times 
utilise their services in the field hospital 
The Natal Volunteer Ambulance Corps 
This corps was organised by Colonel Gallwey RAMC 
CB at the commencement of the war They are commanded 
by unattached regimental officers who have taught the men 
the rudiments of company drill The corps has been a com 
plete success and has proved conclusively that volunteers are 
capable of performing satisfactorily all the duties of bearer 
companies 
THE SICK AND WOUNDED IN DURBAN 
HARBOUR 
By George Ashton MBVict 
Civilian Surgeonto HM Hospital Ship Nubia 
Durban Natal March 9th 1900 
The Hospital Ships 
At the present moment there are no fewer than eight hospital 
ships lying in Durban Harbour and they each have accommo 
dation as follows  
Spartan 120 patients belonging to the Union Steamship Co 
Trojan 120    Union Steamship Co 
Lismore Castle 160    Castle Steamship Co 
Nubia 300     P and O S N Co 
Maine 218    Atlantic Transport Co 
Orcana 166    Pacific Steam Navigatn Co 
Sunrise 6    Royal Yacht Squadron 
Golden Eagle 6    Royal Yacht Squadron 
Durban Harbour alone thus has accommodation for 1100 
sick and wounded soldiers The Spartan and Trojan were the 
first hospital ships to be sent out at the commencement of the 
war and were fitted up for hospital purposes at Southampton 
last October 
The Spartan leaves for Capetown tomorrow with a full 
complement of sick who are to be transferred to the base 
hospital at Wynberg The Trojan has been acting as base hos 
pital for General Gatacres column at East London and has 
been sent to Durban in order to have some alterations made 
in heir interior with the view of providing accommodation for 
an additional 30 cases The American hospital ship Maine 
leaves in a few days time for home with patients who are in 
capacitated from taking any further part in the present cam 
paign She is always most gaily decorated and the series of 
flags she flies iSiUnique in the history of the world At the 
foremast she flies the Red Cross flag in accordance with the 
terms of the Geneva Convention  at the mainmast proudly 
floats the Union Jack presented by Her Majesty the Queen  
atthemizzenmast the most conspicuous and noteworthy of all 
flies the Stars and Stripes  whilst her poop staff is adorned 
with the Blue Ensign with the yellow anchor denoting 
Admiralty Transport Service It is needless to remind your 
readers that the Maine is the first ship that has sailed under 
the combined flags of Great Britain and the United States 
and I am sure they will cordially reecho the hope that she 
may be the forerunner of many The Lismore Castle Nubia 
and the Orcana have all been fitted up for hospital purposes 
in Durban and so are entirely a Colonial production The 
Golden Eagle and the Sunrise are luxuriously fitted up steam 
yachts belonging respectively to Sir Samuel Scott and 
Mr Jesse Coope and have been 
placed by their owners at the 
disposal of the Government during the present crisis for the 
reception of convalescent officers The Golden Eagle is 
attached to the Nubia whilst the Sunrise will be an annex to 
the Lismore Castle 
The 
 
Nubia 
Considerable alterations have been made in the Nubia 
recently When fitted up in January she was able to accom 
modate 474 patients of whom 174 were provided with cots the 
other 300 being distributed amongst the convalescent wards 
These convalescent patients had their meals at meSs tables 
and slept in hammocks suspended overhead which in the 
daytime were taken down and stowed away  in fact their 
daily routine was almost precisely the same as that of a trans 
port at sea This is now altogether changed and the two 
convalescent wards have been fitted up with cots The other 
five wards have all received additional cots every square foot 
of available space being utilised The net result of these 
changes is that the Nubia can now accommodate 300 cot cases 
whilst before the alterations she could accommodate 174 cot 
cases and 300 slight or convalescent cases The need of an 
aray apparatus was keenly felt and upon representing the 
matter to Colonel Clery RAMC PMO of the Lines of 
Communication he immediately had a complete Roentgen 
ray apparatus placed on board A first saloon cabin has been 
fitted up as a dark room with a supply of fresh water sink 
and a table resembling an operating table for patients to lie 
on while they are being skiagraphed Already some excellent 
skiagraphs have been taken and developed and they have 
proved of the greatest service especially in shell wounds as 
with their aid the presence of small particles of shell have 
been ascertained and their position localised thus enabling 
the surgeons to cut down and remove them with the least 
possible delay and danger to the patient 
Dysentery and Rheumatism 
We received our first instalment of patients on January 
nth and from that date up to today we have had on the 
Nubia 962 cases of whom 288 are now on board It is a most 
significant fact and one that gives rise to grave thought 
that out of these 962 cases only 289 have been suffering from 
gunshot wounds disease accounting for the large remainder 
of 673 Of these 673 cases dysentery claims the most victims 
with 230 rheumatism stands second with 82 Fortunately 
we have only had 7 cases of enteric on board These figures 
show that the casualties even in this war are due less to 
wounds than to the wear and tear of war  to exposure to un 
favourable climatic conditions as sudden changes of tempera 
ture especially felt whilst on outpost and picket duty at 
night to irregularity of feeding and food sometimes of an in 
different kind  to impure water and overripe or underripe 
fruit 
Progress of Patients 
However there is great matter for congratulation and 
thanksgiving in the fact that out of the 674 cases discharged 
from the Nubia no fewer than 443 have returned to the front fit 
to resume their duties there Today 32 have been returned 
to the depot at Maritzburg to be sent on to their different 
regiments It is quite a common thing for the hospital 
trains after bringing down their freight of sick and wounded 
to return with a load of men who have recovered and are eager 
to again try conclusions with their countrys enemiek The 
number of men sent home as unfit for further service is 170  
some incapacitated for months  others alas  for ever inca 
pacited from again proceeding on active service The 
remaining 61 have been transferred to Wynberg in the hope 
that a change of scene and climate may facilitate and hasten 
their recovery 
Total number of cases January nth to March 10th  962 
Discharged fit for duty 443 
Discharged unfit for further service  170 
Transferred to Wynberg will probably return to duty 61  
Remaining on board   288 
Twentysix operations have been performed of these n were for the 
j removal of either Mauser bullets or pieces of shell 
It is with deep regret we have to record two deaths  a sea 
man belonging to the Naval Brigade as the result of puru 
lent meningitis following old mastoid disease which had been 
I aggravated by exposure at the front  and Lieutenant Lock

wood of the Scottish Rifles who had been sent down with a 
bullet wound of the shoulder received at Spion Kop The 
wound was progressing favourably when he unfortunately de 
veloped enteric fever perforation of the bowel ensuing They 
were both interred with the fullest military honours The 
good people of Durban by providing luxuries are doing great 
things 
Comforts and Luxuries 
At first owing to the hurried manner in which the ship was 
prepared and for other reasons there was naturally a little 
trouble and friction in getting things to work smoothly but 
now everything in this respect is all that can be desired No 
expense has been spared and patients be they officers or 
men will be very hard to please if they are not satisfied 
Tommy must have his 
 
smoke and he suffers no stint in 
this respect as only last week a present of 10000 Egyptian 
cigarettes were sent on board by a Durban resident Sir 
William MacCormac Sir William Stokes and Mr Trves 
have each in turn visited the ship and as far as I can 
gather have expressed the greatest satisfaction regarding the 
progress of all the cases and the admirable manner in which 
the patients comfort and their welfare is looked after The 
tins of chocolate sent out by the Queen as a New Years gift 
to her troops have been distributed to the men on board and 
are naturally greatly prized by the fortunate recipients 
These tin boxes will be a most valuable memento of the 
South African war and they are already fetching fancy 
prices  only last week one was sold in Durban for 35s The 
Marked Testaments have also arrived on board and have 
been 
given out They are small portable books in a strong 
red binding and enclosed in a suitable case They have 
South Africa 1900 printed in large gilt letters on the 
front and 200 selected verses havebeen underlined in red 
and black ink 
It only remains to be said that the patients are thoroughly 
satisfied with the ship and fully appreciate the efforts made 
for their comfort and enjoyment and if there is such a 
thing as feeling regret at leaving a home of pain the 
inmates of the Nubia feel it when they get their discharge 
although of course it is combined with a keenness to get 
back to the front again Everyone is cheerful and good 
tempered and there is not a sour or discontented face in any 
of the beds This fact particularly struck the American 
doctors from the Maine when they paid a visit It is 
wonderful they said A lot of these men are badly 
smashed and yet they are cheerful and lighthearted How 
is it  A possible solution to this interesting query is that 
Britons not only know how to fight with pluck but also how 
to suffer with fortitude and that their fellow men and women 
are continually working to make the sufferers pillows easy 
and their time of pain brimful of comfort and sympathetic 
tenderness 
NEW HOSPITAL HUTS AT ALDERSHOT 
In consequence of the expected arrival in this country of 
many more sick and wounded from South Africa it has been 
determined to erect huts for 700 patients at Aldershot 
Huts for 160 patients are being built at the Cambridge Hos 
pital near enough to that establishment to permit of their 
being administrated from it 
At the Connaught Hospital in the North Camp where more 
space is available huts are being put up for 540 patients but 
as they are somewhat more distant from the hospital kitchens 
are to be added They are however near enough to be 
administered from the hospital which is an advantage to all 
concerned 
Each hut will afford accommodation for 20 patients giving 
ample cubic space and superficial area The walls and roof 
are of corrugated iron lined with matchboardinsr groined and 
tongued with an intermediate layer of felt The floor is a 
foot above the ground and composed of white pine boarding 
The walls of the hut are supported on iron stanchions bedded 
in concrete There is permanent ridge ventilation from end 
to end of the hut draughts being prevented by minutely per 
forated zinc inside and ont In each hut there are ten win 
dows the lower part of each window opens outwards and the 
upper part inwards into a hopper 
Each hut is heated by two Magnet stoves and there is the 
usual lavatory and closet accommodation at one end cut off 
from the ward by doors 
The lighting is for the present by oil lamps as electric 
lighting although in principle decided on has not yet been 
introduced into Aldershot 
The foul drainage is connected with the general system by 
glazed earthenware pipes 
DESPATCHES MEDICAL OFFICERS RN 
The London Gazette of March 30th publishes despatches 
received from RearAdmiral Sir Robert Harris Commander 
inChief on the Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa 
reporting the proceedings of the Naval Brigade with Lord 
Methuen from the time they joined his headquarters up to the 
date of the battle of Graspan  and also the proceedings of 
the Naval Brigade with Sir Redvers Bullerat the battle of 
Colenso on December 15th 
After describing the course of the engagement Captain A 
E Marchant Royal Marines the officer in command men 
tions the services of the officers engaged and adds Fleet 
Surgeon James Porter who was with the firing line and Sur 
geon Beadnell with the guns did gallant and most excellent 
service under trying conditions under fire nearly the whole 
time 
And Lieutenant Dean RN in his report says   
I found 
Surgeon Beadnell at Bel mont Station  he had been invalided 
by a medical Board that day and was waiting for the hospital 
train Though in bad health he gladly accepted my order to 
remain with the guns in view of the pending engagement 
and on Saturday he rendered invaluable aid to our wounded 
working close up to the guns where shrapnel balls were 
showering every other minute 
At the battle of Colenso Lieutenant Ogilvy who was in 
command of six 12pr guns attached to the Second Brigade 
says in his report   
Surgeon Macmillan RN and Lieu 
tenant Palmer RAMC were conspicuous in their attend 
ance to the wounded

AN AMBULANCE FROM INDIA 
The tonga ambulance train offered by a Parsi gentleman for service with 
thetroops in South Africa left Pindi for Calcutta by special train on 
February 9th It comprises 50 horses with harness and belongings and 
20 vehicles 12 large with stretchers and 8 small without stretchers The 
animals are country bred thoroughly trained and broken to harness The 
tonga is built to supply a want much felt on field service as a means of 
quickly transporting sick and wounded of mounted troops moving faster 
than the rest of the army The tonga is hung with springs and can be 
used either with or without stretcher In the latter case it accommo 
dates two in a recumbent posture or if the patients can sit up the large 
conveyance can hold five and the smaller three The stretchers easily 
foldable can be packed on the splash board Each tonga has waterproof 
purdahs on all four sides It is adaptable to bullock draught with slight 
modifications in harness The tent is a simple twofold cloth stretching 
from the arch of the tonga top to the ground the outer fold made of 
millerained khaki drill impervious to rain the inner fold of millerained 
thin lining The lightness enables it to be rolled up and carried on the tonga 
cover The tongas were freely used during the Tirah Field Force opera 
tions for bringing sick and wounded from front to base and were most 
favourably reported on They were also tried during the cavalry camp 
exercise at Delhi and at Attock man uvres and under the orders of the 
CommanderinChief in India are in daily use on cavalry field days 
The Metric System in RussiaThe metric system is 
about to be introduced in Russia a project of law prepared by

State on the condition that regular assistance is furnished by 
scientific societies and universities for the verification of the 
weights and measures used in commerce Since 1896 the sys

THE MIDWIVES BILL 
A meeting of medical and lay constituents of the boroughs 
and divisions of SouthEast London and adjacent parts of 
Kent and Surrey to consider and adopt measures to resist 
the registration of midwives and particularly the Bill now 
before Parliament was held at the Cannon Street Hotel 
London on April 4th 
The chair was occupied by Mr George Brown Direct 
Representative for England on the General Medical Council 
who in his opening remarks said that the public ought to 
know that the medical profession was not altogether indifferent 
in regard to the Midwives Bill now before Parliament The 
mef tin g might be somewhat belated but in 1892 before the Com 
mittee of the House of Commons the suggestion was made that 
the medical opposition was dictated by pecuniary motives This 
was at once repudiated The Bill was opposed because it would 
not do what the promoters of the Bill said that it would do  it 
would not remove a danger from the public it would not render 
midwifery safer and the mortality would not be less The 
Bill did not propose to prevent the practice of midwifery by 
those who were uneducated  it proposed to put on the roll all 
the ignorant women now practising midwifery and stamp 
them as legalised to do so That would not contribute to the 
safety of the public A three months training could not 
qualify these women to be practical midwives The 
contention was as stated in the evidence given by 
him in 1892 that none should practise midwifery but 
those who were fully qualified in midwifery medicine 
and surgery It was the duty of the State to put fully 
qualified medical aid within the reach of the poor lyingin 
 women It ought not to be necessary for medical men to 
protest against the Bill The public ought to demand from 
the Legislature that none but those who were properly quali 
fied should be allowed to attend midwifery cases The Prin 
ciple of the Midwives Bill had unfortunately received the 
sanction of the House of Commons and he maintained that 
had been done through the representatives of the Govern 
ment deliberately ignoring public opinion and refusing to 
he instructed by the medical profession in this matter 
It was not fair to the medical profession nor to the public nor 
to Parliament that the Lord President had not received depu 
tations representing the medical profession to put this matter 
before him in the true light when he had received deputations 
from the promoters of the Bill As a profession they did 
not maintain that no legislation was necessary they 
believed that some legislation was necessary but they 
certainly believed that ignorance should not take the place 
of learning and incompetence the place of skill Had 
they had an opportunity of speaking to the Lord 
President of the Privy Council and through him to 
the members of Parliament and to the public they would 
have made plain that whilst they were anxious that those
