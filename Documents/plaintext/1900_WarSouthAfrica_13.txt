THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE BATTLE OF SPION KOP 
By FREDERICK TREVES FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Forces 
Spearmans8 Hill January 28th 1900 
THE HOSPITAL BEHIND MOUNT ALICE 
As I mentioned in my last letter the hospital to which I 
was attached moved tb the banks of the Tugela We 
Teached the river on January i8th and pitched our tents 
close to the headquarters camp and just under the hill 
Mount Alicefrom which the big naval guns were firing 
We were thus as near as possible to the actual fighting 
It was intended that the wounded taken off the field shoald 
be brought to our hospital and then be moved down to 
Frere and thence to the base as quickly as possible It is 
1twentyfive miles across the veld from this camp to Fere 
The road is not so bad as roads go in this part of the 
country but it is very rough in places and several drifts 
have to be crossed At Frere the railway is reached 
FIRST WOUNDED ADMITTED 
On the Sunday after our arrival the wounded began to 
come in Thirteen only came from the division posted at 
Potgeiters drift the rest came from Sir Charles Warrens 
division Increasing numbers of wounded came in every 
day in batches of from 5o to i 5o They were all attended 
to and were sent on to Frere as soon as possible All the 
serious cases were of course kept in the hospital 
THE ATTACK ON SPION Kop 
On Wednesday January 24th came the terrible affair of 
Eipion Kop I was awakened about 3 AM by the rifle fire 
attending the night attack upon the hill and all through 
the day the artillery and rifle firing was terrible and in 
cessant Spion Kop is just opposite the hill under the 
shelter of which our hospital stands and from this hill 
the engagement could be witnessed The hill is steep and 
was approached from the side of the river I watched our 
men climb up and it was evident that in certain steep 
places the getting of the wounded down would be attended 
with difficulty The shell fire to which our men were ex 
posed was very severe and it was clear that the casualties 
would be numerous Our hospitalwhen first we reached 
the riverwas made up of 6o tents and io marquees On 
Tuesday the order was given to increase it by IOO bell tents 
This meant additional accommodation for 5o0 patients 
No increase in the staff was possible Under the able 
direction of Majors Kirkpatrick and Mallins the arrange 
ments were complete on Wednesday 
THE WOUNDED FROM SPION Kop 
On Thursday the wounded came pouring in and they 
came in the whole day and until late at night until the 
hospital was full The number taken in that day was 
nearly 6oo We had already sent down some 300 so the 
casualties have been heavier than at Colenso In spite of 
the immense number of the wounded they were all got 
under shelter by Thursday night had had their more 
serious injuries attended to and had been made as com 
fortable as circumstances would admit They bora evi 
dence of the excellent work done in the field hospitals 
These hospitals bear the brunt of the trouble and carry 
out the first treatment They did splendidly on Wed 
nesday and Thursday The volunteer ambulance corps 
and the large body of coolie bearers did excellent service 
The larger number of the wounded were on the top of 
Spion Kop The path down was about two miles was 
steep and in places very difficult The carriage of the 
wounded down the hill had all to be by hand From the 
foot of the hill to the hospital the carriage was by ambul 
ance waggons and in some cases by coolie bearers All the 
stretchers had hoods There was no doubt that the 
wounded suffered much on account of the tedious trans 
port but it was rendered as nearly perfect as possible 
The surgeons who went after the wounded on the top of 
the hill told me that the sight of the dead and injured was 
terrible in the extreme the wounds having been mostly 
from shell and shrapnel some men had been blown 
almost to pieces The weather on Wednesday was warm 
but was not to be compared with the intense heat on the 
day of the battle of Colenso the temperature was that of 
a hot summers day in England Thursday was fortunately 
cloudy and much cooler 
THE NATuRE OF THE WOUNDS AND THE CONDITION OF 
THE WOUNDED 
As to the wounded there was the usual proportion of 
minor injuries but on the whole the wounds were much 
more severe than thosereneived at Colenso This is 
explained by the large number of wounds from shell and 
shrapnel The men moreover were much exhausted by 
the hardships they had undergone In many instances 
they had not had their clothes off for a week or ten days 
They had slept in the open without great coats and had 
been reduced to the minimum in the matter of rations 
The nights were cold and there was on nearly every 
night a heavy dew Fortunately there was little or no 
rain The want of sleep and the long waiting upon the 
hill had told upon them severely There is no doubt also 
that the incessant shell fire must have proved a terrible 
strain Some of the men although severely wounded 
were found asleep upon their stretchers when brought in 
Many were absolutely exhausted and worn out indepen 
dently of their wounds 
TTHE MEN ARE SPLENDID 
In spite of all their hardships the wounded men behaved 
as splendidly as they always have done They never com 
plained They were quite touching in their unselfishness 
and in their anxiety not to give trouble The English 
soldier is a man of whom the country may well be proud 
and in these two terrible engagements on the Tugela they 
behaved from first to last in a manner worthy of the 
splendid traditions of the British army A finer hardier 
and more heroic set of men could hardly have been gathered 
together They were much depressed at the reverse One 
poor fellow had been shot in the face by a piece of shell 
which had carried awayllis left eye the left upper jaw 
with the corresponding part of the cheek and had left a 
hideous cavity at the bottom of which his tongue was 
exposed He had been lying hours on the hill He was 
unable to speak and as soon as he was landed at the 
hospital he made signs that he wanted to write Pencil 
and paper were given him and it was supposed he wished 
to ask for something but he merely wrote  Did we win  
No one had the heart to tell him the truth 
WOUNDS OF THE NECK AND HEAD 
The Mauser wounds showed nothing new The bullet 
at a long range acts more like a finepointed instrument 
going through bone without splintering it and dividing 
nerves and arteries with remarkable neatness One case 
showed a communication between the external carotid 
artery and some adjacent vein and another a communica 
tion between the common femoral artery and vein There 
were several wounds involving the neck in which the 
larynx was involved In one of these in which I per 
formed tracheotomy the lesion had been effected by a piece 
of shell and it was surprising that the patient could have 
survived the damage to the larynx and gullet He is so far 
doing well 
General Woodgate received a very severe wound of the 
head from a fragment of shell The piece entered at the 
outer angle of the right orbit and ploughed along the 
skull as far as the pinna It made a linear ragged gap in

the bone Much brain matter was escaping and the sight 
in the right eye was lost I opened up the wound and re 
moved all depressed and loose fragments of bone with a 
relief to the patient which is I am afraid only tem 
porary 
TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL WOITNDS 
The abdominal wounds are numerous Few are suited 
for operation I have seen on the one hand many in 
which a Mauser bullet has passed through the abdomen in 
almost every direction and in which recovery has followed 
without operation On the other hand abdominal sections 
are not very easily carried out on the field and I think the 
cases for operation are best limited to those in which the 
lesion is well localised and in which the bullet has escaped 
Bullet wounds of the liver have done well as also have 
like wounds of the kidney An officer with a bullet 
wound of the liverno exithas done well after passing 
through a serious crisis 
AMPUTATIONS 
Very few amputations are required for Mauser wounds 
Most of the amputations have been for shell wounds In 
some cases bullets other than the Mauser probably the 
MartiniHenry have been used Some of the compound 
fractures of the leg in both officers and men may yet need 
amputation Wounds do remarkably well in camp 
SHELL WOUNDS 
The shell wounds are the most terrible and the most 
difficult to treat One man had most of the face shot 
away including both eyes Another had the forearm shot 
off and two fearful wounds of each thigh dividing the 
anterior muscles to the bone The chest cases are numerous 
but do quite fairly One patient has developed pneumonia 
and others have pneumothorax or hremothorax So far 
there has been little gangrene In one case a shrapnel had 
opened the ulnar artery and the man came down safely with 
a tourniquet on his brachial composed of a plug of cake 
tobacco and the tape of a puttie Of the many curious 
tourniquets I have seen this is the most ingenious 
THE HOSPITAL NURSES AND ORDERLIES 
We have a few iron bedsteads in the hospital which are 
of great service and are much appreciated The great 
majority of the patients however are lying on the ground 
and cannot be dressed without difficulty As many as pos 
sible are accommodated on stretchers I have slept on a 
stretcher since I came to the front and can testify that 
they are most comfortable Miss McCaul and the two 
Netley Sisters have rendered invaluable service and have 
worked day and night It is hard to imagine what we 
should have done without them Three nursing sisters 
however can hardly cope with a hospital containing over 
700 wounded men and the great mass of the work falls 
upon the orderlies who are a singularly efficient obliging 
hardworking set of men 
THE MILITARY HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG 
By Sir WILLIAM STOKES MD FRCSI 
WE have received the following communication from Sir 
William Stokes SurgeoninOrdinary to the Queen in Ireland 
and Consulting Surgeon to the Field Forces in South Africa 
describing a visit which he paid to the military hospitals at 
Wynberg in the neighbourhood of Capetown shortly after his 
arrival from England 
THE WOUNDED 
On January 25th I visited the hospital at Wynberg and 
was most courteously received by its Principal Medical 
Officer Colonel Anthonisz Accompanied by him and Mr Fox 
Symons who has had a large experience of military surgery 
not only in the late GrEecoTurkish but also in the present 
South African war I visited Nos I and 2 
The number of patients at present under treatment is not 
very great owing doubtless to a lull in the hostWities during 
the past fortnight But still in the wards I found many cases of 
exceptional surgical interesttraumatic aneurysms injuries 
of nerves fractures of the femur tibia fibula and humerus 
and many cases illustrating the eccentric courses bullets take 
at times even invading the brain the thorax or the abdomen 
without destroying life One case struck me particularly 
The ball entered the skull above and behind the left zygoma 
passed forwards and downwards penetrating the orbit then 
entered the nasal fossa and ultimately emerged in the right 
submaxillary space without fracturing the lower jaw The 
patient has recovered but with loss of sight in the left 
eye There have been several traumatic aneurysms of the 
axillary posterior tibial popliteal and brachial arteries 
These have been successfully operated on all by the method 
of Antyllus namely ligation of the artery on the proximal 
and distal side of the tumour and excision of the sac 
Colonel Stevenson the author of the wellknown handbook of 
military surgery Wounds in War operated on a large 
diffused traumatic aneurysm of the axillary artery in which 
there was no pulsation whatever The result was most satis 
factory 
Several exceptionally interestingcases of perforating pulmo 
nary wounds have been treated and the results in many of 
them have been complete recovery This has been largely 
attributed to the comparatively minute tunnellike wounds in 
flicted by the Mauser bullet It appears to be agreed that the 
Mauser bullet inflicts as a rule a much less serious injury than 
any of the others In a large proportion of instances when 
a bone is struck instead of being splintered or pulverised it is 
tunnelled and the opening made being very small soon fills 
up and the cases as a rule do well The necessity for ampu 
tation or resection does not therefore arise as often as formerly 
This opinion is strongly held by the eminent Principal Medical 
Officer ofthe Field Force SurgeonGeneral Wilson 
THEI ADMINISTRATION 
As regards hospital management administration and 
nursing the arrangements in the Wynberg Hospital are de 
serving of high commendation With the operating theatre 
I was most favourably impressed I found everything well up 
to date The walls sheetea with enamelled zinc the floor tiled 
and sloping the light abundant both from above and one side 
and for night operations electric light Ample arrangements 
for sterilising instruments and dressing have been made and 
hard by is a room for Roentgen ray photographic work Great 
credit is due to the military authorities who have brought the 
arrangements and fittings of this hospital to such a high 
degree of perfection and I trust that in Natal which is my 
present destination and where I hope to meet Sir William 
MacCormac and Mr Treves I may have the good fortune to 
work in hospitals equally well equipped 
INVALIDING FROM THE TRANSPORTS 
FROM OUJR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CAPETOWN 
February 7th 1900 
THE UNDERMANNING OF THE R AMC 
I AM compelled this week to depart somewhat from the tone 
of optimism which I have hitherto honestly adopted and to 
point out one or two directions in which the military 
machinery is showing some signs of strain These signs 
have only become evident quite recently and one has 
no justification for reflecting in any way upon the men on the 
spot They are working one and all gallantly The material 
at command is at fault Up to the time of the arrival of the 
recent reinforcements the Sixth and Seventh Divisions and 
the auxiliaries the department was standing the strain 
admirably Now two things are becoming evident one that 
the personnel of the RAC both officers and men is insuf 
ficient and without automatic machinery for expansion and 
the other that the roerves and militia are from a physical 
point of view somews disappointing 
INVALID RESERVISTS AND MILITIA 
One has always held the idea that whatever might be the 
case with regard to the militia the reservist would be of 
superior physique to the man with the colours Transport 
after transport tells us a different tale It is perfectly true 
that the average reservist is a better developed man than his 
comrade with the colours but it is unfortunately true tha 


536 mm Ban THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR MARCH 3 1900 
both reservists and militiamen contain a very large number of 
lame ducks hopelessly incapable of going to the front 
This is not the case to any appreciable extent with the 
colours men who are obviously under such continual observa 
tion as to render it very unlikely that any obviously unfit 
men could be drafted for foreign service But the percentage 
of others who are being landed here and sent to the station 
hospital with the immediate result of being marked for re 
drafting to England is far greater than would have been the 
case had an efficient system of inspection been adopted on 
your side I am inclined to connect the number of lame ducks 
with the deficient personnel of the RAMC From the object 
lessons one is seeing here it is quite evident that the exami 
tions at home have been conducted either by men who 
do not understand military requirements or by men who 
were so pressed for time that they had to run through 
the work at a speed which does not permit thorough 
investigation On no other supposition couldone explain 
the fact that cases of distinct phthisis of renal disease 
of wellmarked tertiary syphilis of ulcer of leg of large 
varicose veins of varicocele of inguinal hernia old of 
chronic gonorrhoea of pretty distinct valvular disease of the 
heart and similar ailments have been landed here and can 
only be sent back again and this not in ones and twos but 
in a very fair proportion The station hospital and un 
fortunately too often its postmortem room is the index of this 
state of things 
THE STATION HOSPITAL AT CAPETOWN 
The station hospital has today about 350 patients with 
accommodation in marquees available for another 150 or more 
that is it is practically a general hospital But a general 
hospital has a staff calculated for 520 beds The station 
hospital has a staff for about half that number and owing to 
the exigencies of the war has gone on expanding and expand 
ing until the work is fairly beyond the power of the staff 
The medical officer in charge has no secretary no divisional 
officers only a small staff of civil surgeons of whom only one 
has had any military experience and who are moreover 
being constantly changed He has 37 of the RAMC all 
told including sergeantmajor and clerks There are in addi 
tion 24 RAMC belonging to other units but these are con 
stantly being withdrawn I man from the Militia Medical 
Staff Corps 23 of the Cape Medical Staff Corps 9 St John 
men from England and ii others But it must be remem 
bered that none of these except the RAMC are fully 
trained and that fatigues are exceptionally heavy mainly 
owing to the constant transfer of patients from one part to 
another and to the constant erection and reerection of 
marquees in the attempt to adjust the accommodation to the 
exigencies of the patients The number of men on fatigue 
duty daily has of late been on an average 25 Beside 2 ward 
masters I9 or 20 special night orderlies are regularly detailed 
This means three nights in bed for the staff and even then 
four of the proper wards two detached huts 8o beds two 
quite detached iron huts 8o beds a marquee camp at a 
long distance away with go patients and sundry marquees 
are without any attendant after 5 Pm It is true that every 
effort is made to put the more serious cases into the better 
attended wards but carry that as far as you may the wards 
left to themselves at night contain many cases for whom 
supervision is necessary Discipline of course must go to 
the wall and even this attenuated staff is being depleted by 
the transfer of a sergeant and four corporals to the two addi 
tional companies of the Cape Medical Staff Corps now being 
raised These are for bearer purposes and the material com 
ing forward appears to me to be indifferent To add to the 
difficulty the already overworked orderly officers at the sta 
tion hospital are charged with the duty of examining num 
bers of recruits 
NEED FOR MORE ORDERLIES AND NuRsEs 
I blame no local authority for all this The Medical Depart 
ment has no real reserve and the material for replenishing 
is not forthcoming You can easily make a good light horse 
trooper out of your average colonial but the same does not 
hold good on the medical side Weighty as are the objec 
tions to nurses the weightiest being the difficulty of accom 
modating them I see no way out of the trouble but falling 
back upon the colonial nurses Three nursing sisters Miss 
Thomas of the Army Nursing Service and two volunteers 
Mrs Bond and Mrs Withycombe have just joined and are 
working in the enteric and pneumonia wards

BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
XV 
THE TURN OF THE TIDE 
THE good news of the surrender of the army which had 
invested Kimberley for so long has been quickly followed by 
the official announcement that a portion of the relief force 
has entered Ladysmith The relief has been purchased at a 
heavy cost and it is to be feared that the sufferings of the 
garrisons have been severe Reports received since the relief 
of Kimberley show that that town offered a heroic resist 
ance and that its inhabitants endured much from hunger 
and disease as well as from the enemy The forces on 
which Colonel Kekewich had to rely were small and indiffer 
ently armed for the defence of so large a town and the re 
sources in food supplies had run extremely low before the 
siege was raised Thus a correspondent of the Daily Chronicle 
says that the people tell harrowing stories of their sufferings 
during the siege rivalling those of Paris The stock of mealies 
had been consumed the horses were starving and those which 
died of starvation were seized and devoured by the kaffirs 
Numbers of women and children lived in the underground 
workings of the mines and when they came to the surface 
they were pale and weirdlooking like the inhabitants of a 
nether world On Friday February x6th many saw the sun 
for the first timefor weeks This residence underground and in 
bombproof pits may have avoided heavy losses by the Boer bom 
bardment but I fear that when all the story is told to the 
casualties of men during the siege will have to be added a long 
roll of children These children have not only had their milik 
supply cut off but have been compelled to put up with an in 
differentwatersupply Kimberleyunderordinarycircumstances 
is supplied by water brought in i8 miles by pumping from the 
Vaal river this supply was long ago cut off and that obtain 
able from the mines could not be entirely trustworthy Siege 
soup which appears to have consisted of what available vege 
tables there were with a certain amount of horseflesh may 
have sufficed for adults but among children it is hardly to be 
wondered at that many died for want of more suitable 
nourishment Apart from the privations which all alike had 
to suffer several women and children are reported killed and 
wounded during the bombardment 
BRITISH AND BOER AMBULANCES 
Reuters agent at Arundel reporting the other day says 
there is a marked difference between the character of our 
ambulance waggons and those of the Boers Ours appear 
designed to combine the greatest clumsiness and the least 
comfort with the minimum of accommodation It takes ten 
mules to draw them and they carry 2 men lying down and 
several sitting they jolt like a quarrymans dray The Boer 
ambulances on the other hand are lightly but strongly built 
and provide comfortable accommodation for 8 men lying 
down they are mounted on springs and scarcely jolt at all 
If this report be true it is certainly not altogether creditable 
to us It must however be pointed out that there is among 
colonists and also among the Boers a predilection in favour of 
the spiderbuilt American vehicle which has not yet extended 
itself to Britishers either military or civil In discussing 
field ambulances in a former letter I suggested that the ideal 
light ambulance was an American spider and the BRITISH 
MEDICAL JOURNAL produced an illustration showing the sort 
of vehicle indicated The extension of this style of mounting 
on wheels to our larger ambulance waggons would undoubt 
edly be advantageous I have travelled for days in light 
American spiderbuilt waggonettes drawn by mules over the 
rough veld roads and it is astonishing how light strong and 
at the same time comfortable these spiderbuilt vehicles are 
The English cart waggon or carriage is invariably built on 
much heavier lines than the same vehicle would be in 
America and this gives a certain clumsiness which is not 
felt over macadamised roads but causes discomfort to the 


MAROH 3 190 THE RAIC AT DUNDEE 2m To 537 
passengers and additional labour to the horses or mules 
dIrawing it in such a country as the prairie or the veldt This 
matter is well worth the consideration of the Army Medical 
Department and the whole subject of remodelling the 
ambulance transport should receive attention 
SIR JAMES SIVEWRIGHTs AMBULANCE CORPS 
Mr Allan Johnson one of the three British members of the 
South African Medical Corps organised by Sir James Sive 
wright sent a full account of the remarkable adventures of 
that expedition to the Aberdeen Free Press and other journals 
The story may be summarised as follows Although the 
Transvaal Government had telegraphed to Capetown declin 
ing the services of the ambulance the members were induced 
to proceed to Delagoa Bay where they had an interview with 
Mr Pott the Transvaal Consul who told them curtly that 
they were not wanted declaring that there were no wounded 
requiring assistance Mr Potts object however appears to 
have been to get rid of the British element of the corps The 
Boer members who had remained discreetly in the back 
ground so long as the corps had to deal with the British 
Colonial authorities at the Cape or at Durban now claimed 
complete control over the expedition In spite of therefusal 
of the Transvaal Government to have anything to do with the 
corps they accepted the friendly assurances of a Boer whom 
they met fortuitously at Lourengo Marques that their ser 
vices if volunteered individually would be accepted The 
British members of the ambulance regarded these strange 
developments with suspicion and Dr Gray sought to retain 
the equipment of the expedition until Sir James Sivewrights 
wishes had been elicited Sir James then telegraphed that 
they were to be handed over to the Boer leader Dr Neeth 
ling who proceeded with the other Boers under special pass 
ports to Pretoria Mr Johnson says in conclusion it was 
clear that while the Transvaal Government was quite wil 
ling to receive any number of Afrikanders into their service 
they would not look at an ambulance corps which included 
Britishers especially if these showed that they meant to 
stick tenaciously to their pledge to work for the wounded of 
every sort and race without prejudice in the interest of 
humanity alone I 
THE BRITISH LOSSES IN THE WAR 
The War Office has issued an analytical table of the total 
casualties since the beginning of the war up to the week end 
ing February 17th From these statistics it will be seen that 
the proportion of killedI4og officers and men to the 
wounded 5303is at the rate of I to 37 Of the wounded it 
is extremely satisfactory to note that over 95 per cent re 
covered This is a far higher percentage of recoveries than 
is recorded in any of the campaigns given in Stevensons 
book In plain English the deduction from these statistics 
is that the chances of recovery for a wounded man are no less 
than I9 to I The excellent prospects of recovery which are 
thus afforded to men placed hor8 de combat are due to the 
humane qualities of the modern small magazinerifle bullet 
either Mauser or LeeMetford But it is extremely unsatis 
factory to learn from Lord Robertss telegram from Paarde 
berg of February 24th that six of the men yesterday Feb 
ruary 23rd were wounded by hollownosedMauserbullets The 
nickel case is slit with four slits making the projectile of the 
most expansive and explosive nature possible A wounded 
Boer brought into our hospital yesterday had sixty of these 
bullets in his pockets The brutality of such conduct merits 
the strongest condemnation The bullets described by Lord 
Roberts are those used by sportsmen for shooting big game 
for while the Mauser and LeeMetford bullet having a conical 
hard nickle tip inflicts a clean small and readily healing 
wound the same bullets by very little manipulation can be 
made to produce wounds of the most terrible character I 
have myself usedthe LeeMetford bullet in deer stalking and 
have seen evidence of what it can do if the nose of the bulllet 
be made of soft lead and hollow or even if the nickel casing 
be split up 
DYSENTERY 
Dysentery is one of the commonest forms of disease in 
South Africa and is especially attendant upon camp or cam 
paigning life Under the term is embraced a group of dis 
eases affecting chiefly the large intestine They are similar 
in their symptoms but they differ in etiology and patho 
logical results It is erroneous to suppose that dysentery is 
confined to the tropics or subtropical countries As a matter 
of fact dysentery has often proved the scourge of armies 
and was notably so among our own troops both in the Penin 
sula and in the Crimea It is also the disease of halfstarved 
garrisons and illfed prisoners Although dysentery may 
occur in temperate regions especially among exposed armies 
as in the case of our army in the Crimea it increases in fre 
quency and malignancy as the tropics are approached 
Hamilton West an American writer ranks it in malignancy 
and mortality in the tropics with yellow fever smallpox and 
cholera as one of the four great epidemic diseases in the 
world As a matter of fact all forms of gastric and enteric 
catarrh increase in frequency and severity as the tropics are 
approached Provisionally it is convenient to consider dys 
entery as occurring in no fewer than four different forms 
these are the catarrhal form ameebic dysentery the diph 
therial and Japanese forms of dysentery The commonest 
in South Africa is undoubtedly the catarrhal form 
Diarrhcea frequently precedes an attack and at first is not 
painful then follow griping abdominal pains frequently 
bloodstained stools with straining of the anus and tenesmus 
later the stools become more gelatinous and bloody The 
disease may last from a week to a month and is usually fol 
lowed by recovery though death occurs in some cases of 
severe sloughing and ulceration 
In this form of disease no specific organism has yet been 
definitely assigned the responsibility although Osler states 
that the  cercomonas intestinalis  is found in large quanti 
ties in the discharges Mr Treves discusses the treatment of 
dysentery and tells us that Dr Scott of Maritzburg and other 
local physicians are strongly in favour of sulphate of mag 
nesia This saline treatment as it is called has a strong ad 
vocate in Trousseau and both in India and in South Africa there 
are physicians who prefer this salt together with the sulphate 
of sodium to any other drugs Personally I confess I have 
found Livingstones fever formula for African dysentery of 
great value The Livingstone powder as it is called consists 
of a combination of calomel bismuth and compound 
ipecacuanha powder One of Dr Jamesons favourite reme 
dies for dysentery was the injection into the bowel of a large 
enema of warm milk If dysentery takes on at all a chronic 
character there is nothing in my experience better than small 
doses of castor oil and opium at short intervals Milk diet is 
of the utmost importance 
KIT FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
The Morning Post of February 24th refers to my last letter 
on the subject of kit for soldiers proceeding to South Africa 
The question is undoubtedly an important one and I have no 
hesitation in saying that in providing kit for some of the 
corps sent out errors for want of information have been made 
As I was myself on an Equipment Committee I append a list 
of articles which in conjunction with several officers of long 
campaigning experience in South Africa were eventually 
selected

THE RAMC AT DTUNDEE 
MAJOR F A B DALY RAMC who was left in Dundee in 
medical charge of the dangerously wounded after the battle of 
Talana Hill after being close on three months in the Boers 
hands at last succeeded in getting away with his whole staff 
military and civilian to Durban iad Pretoria and Delagoa 
Bay Major Daly and his staff were during the last month 
placed under close arrest and finally guarded over the frontier 
THE SPECIAL HOSPITALS

THE PLAGUE 
PROGRESS OF THE DISEAASE 
EuTROPE 
IT is satisfactory to note that no plague exists in Europe at the present 
moment 
AFRICA 
Plague is not recordel from any part of Africa It has disappeared 
from Egypt and the outbreak at Delagoa Bay which at one time seemed 
to be alarming has completely subsided Except for the possibly endemic 
area of plague in Central Africa reported by Koch we have no knowledge 
of the presence of plague in Africa 
INDIA 
The total mortality in Bombay for the week ending February ioth 
reached a maximum of 246i the recorded mortality from plague for the 
week was 456 In the opinion of residents in Bombay plague prevails in 
the city to a much greater extent than official figures indicate so much so 
indeed that many believe the number to be at least twice as many as the 
mortality statistics show but it is allowed that the famine refugees have 
brought many acute ailments in their train Some hundreds of the total 
deaths are assigned to diarrhcea and dysentery Lately some 27 
Europeans have been attacked by plague in Bombay and some doubt is 
thrown upon the use the puolic conveyances are being put to as 
regards the conveyance of infected persons to the hospitals For the 
week ending February gth the deaths from the principal diseases are 
assigned as follows Plague 456 respiratory diseases 406 fevers 242 
smallpoX 225 phthisis I78 diarrhcea I65 dysentery 70 In Caicutta 
plague has a tendency to increase During the week ending February 
3rd 87 deaths from the disease occurred as compared with 65 during the 
previous week In the Patna district there were 620 deaths from plague 
during the week ending February 3rd This is a serious increase and 
points to a possible spread of plague through the NorthWest Provinces 
of India In the Madras Presidency sporadic cases of plague continue to 
occur In the Jullundur district Karachi and the Puniab a small 
number of deaths are recorded At present Rajputana and Central India 
are free of plague 
ADEN 
Six Cases of plague were reported from Aden on February 23rd and I 
death from the disease The authorities are taking active steps to check 
the spread of infection at this important port of call 
MAUIxTIUS 
For the week ending February 22nd 8 fresh cases of plague occurred in 
the island and 4 deaths from the disease For some weeks now the 
return from Mauritius would seem to indicate that the disease is 
stationary 
AUSTRALIA 
A case of plague is reported from Sydney during the past week It is 
also stated that a great number of rats are dying in the goods sheds 
along the quay 
The more we learn of the cases of plague atAdelaide the more puzzling 
does the source of infection become The first victim was a man one of a 
number of deserters from the ship Formosa which arrived at Adelaide on 
November 12th I898 and it was not until six week alter landing on 
Australian soil he was admitted to hospital Moreover it was not at 
Adelaide but at the small township oI Gawler that he was seized with 
plague From the same place also the second plague case came the 
patient being a boy aged 9 years a residnt in Gawler Although the 
captain of the ship Formosa mentions that  a number cases 
of sickness  occurred during the voyage from New York to 
Adelaide they were all of a trivial nature It will be re 
membered that this vessel called nowhere between America and 
Australia and as no plague is known to exist in North America or 
Australia the source of infection seems inexplicable The man when 
brought into hospital was in a filthy condition but we have yet to learn 
that filth generates plague It would seem that infection must have been 
carried from either India or China It is with tlhe latter country that 
Australia is more intimately in contact many Chinese having settied in 
Australia especially along the coast Even then the source of infection 
is a mystery as none of the Chinese in Australia are known to be infected 
by plague 
SIBERIA 
Dr Clemows account of plague in Siberia and Mongolia and the part 
played by the turbagan Arctomys bobac published in the Journal of 
Tropical Medicine seems to show a wide area for the disease It 
would appear that in the former mention of this infected district we 
should have stated that in the Aksha military district in the province of 
Transbaikal Siberia plague has an endemic home where both man 
and animals are attacked Aksha lies almost on the RussoMongolian 
border hence the error in mentioning Mongolia as the seat of the disease 
but as Eastern Mongolia is itself infected it would seem that a continuous 
area of country is infected by plague The Arctomy8 bobac the tfrbagan 
a species of marmot seems to be the undoubted carrier of plague in the 
Transbaikal Province and possibly in one of the infected districts of 
Mongolia
