THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
XI 
THE HOT DRY SUMMER 
MR FREDERICK TREVESS letter from Frere Camp which ap 
peared in the last issue of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL has 
been read with the greatest interest both by the medical pro 
fession and the public His graphic descriptions of the little 
town and the parched brown veld of the African summer are 
admirable and bring before us as scarcely any other corre 
spondent has done a picture of the camp dry dusty 
parched and rectless under a blazing sun The heat both at 
Frere Camp and in Ladysmith itself appears to have been 
great even for an African summer Thus Mr Treves says 
that on one day it was 1040 in the shade and that a clinical 
thermometer in a bag lying in the tent registered 104 5 
A despatch from Ladysmith by runner dated January 21St 
states among other things that the heat was 1070 in the shade 
A heat of this degree does however not infrequently occur 
during the summer months in the upcountry towns of South 
Africa Thvis in Kimberley I have known the temperature 
over I00 F in the shade daily for weeks together With such 
weather as this it is of course usual and in fact almost neces 
sary in the normal condition of life that people should remain 
almost entirely under shelter during the middle hours of the 
day yet we read of our soldiers in one engagement after 
another exposed to the blazing sun throughout the entire day 
Fortunately in the dry atmosphere of South Africa these ex 
treme temperatures are not so oppressive as in moister 
climates nevertheless a temperature of I00 in the shade 
means something a great deal higher in the actual sun and 
where the sunlight actually falls on the body it produces a 
sensation almost as if one were being hit by a stick 
In the neighbourhood of Frere and the Tugela about 
Colenso the season would appear to have been unusually dry 
a condition which is usually accompanied in the summer by 
excessive heat Thus Mr Treves speaks of the river which 
is reputed to run through Frere as not running at all 
but consisting of a series of dams full of brownish water As 
a matter of fact this is the normal condition of African 
rivers for about nine months in the year It is only during 
the rainy season that they are actually full and flowing We 
have read several accounts of the Tugela being in flood but 
it must be remembered that the Tugela flows out of the 
main range of the Drakensberg and that it is from rainfalls 
higher up that these floods are usually produced It is a 
common feature of South African rivers to be flooded in this 
way by rainfalls in the mountains near their source and to 
flow afterwards it may be for hundreds of miles in a roaring 
torrent I0 to 20 feet aboye their usual height through an arid 
parched and rainless country 
The spot where the Tugela emerges from the Drakensberg is 
but little known or visited but it is of exceptional wildness 
and beauty Emerging high up on the mountains the river 
flows in a large body over the side of a precipice and down 
this it falls broken by occasional ledges for 4000 feet until at 
last in the valley below it descends literally in the form of 
spray The stream is thus changed during its downward course 
from a solid column of water into what is little more than 
vapour The floods that occur in South African rivers fre 
quently come suddenly down a dry river bed without warning 
and it is by no means uncommon for carts and horses or even 
waggons and teams of oxen to be swept suddenly away in 
crossing by a flood of this description 
KIMREERLEY 
From both Ladysmith and Kimberley heliograms of con 
siderable length have recently been published and whatever 
depression may exist outside there is no expression of this 
tone in the messages flashed forth by the garrisons We are 
assured from Kimberley via Modder River on January 24th 
that both people and garrison are in good health and are 
going about their tasks cheerfully An earlier heliogram of 
January 19th is equally satisfactory in its purport Thus it 
says the De Beers Comvany has undertaken the work of the 
sanitation of the town since the failure of the former con 
tractors through the capture of mules carts etc by the 
enemy Readers of my letters will perhaps remember that 
this was one of the dangers I anticipated to the health of the 
town but it has evidently been grappled with satisfactorily 
The ordinary water supply having been cut off that now in 
use is evidently pumped from the mines 
Owing to the wisdom and forethought of the authorities in 
regulating supplies the community is still enabled to obtain 
the absolute necessaries of life at normal prices although 
eggs fowls vegetables etc are at famine rates From these 
reports we may reasonably infer that Kimberley with a popu 
lation of over 20000 can continue to hold out for some con 
siderable time and we cannot allow ourselves to believe that 
in spite of some of our reverses this community will not 
eventually be relieved 
LADYSMITH 
The one item of intelligence which must be held to be satis 
factory whatever be the military course of events in Natal is 
that the general health of the garrison is much better From 
this we may infer that the typhoid epidemic is on the wane 
Some people write as though the relief of Ladysmith were the 
only step necessary to terminate this epidemic but it must 
be borne in mind that typhoid fever is not dependent on a 
state of siege nor would it vanish at the raising of the 
siege It will continue so long as men susceptible to its 
attacks continue to drink a polluted water supply without 
boiling it 
The entire evacuation of the town would of course terminate 
an epidemic dependent on local causes but should occupation 
in any form continue it is obvious that the radical cause of 
this epidemic must be traced and grappled with A Reuters 
telegram of January 2ist says that the fever has abated in the 
garrison doubtless owing to the dry weather This may pos 
sibly afford some explanation for as I indicated in my last 
letter one of the dangers of these tropical rains is that sur 
face drainage and occasionally even flooded latrines flow 
into the river and springs or other sources of water supply 
thus every thunderstorm unless careful precautions are 
taken may be the cause of fresh poisoning of the supply 
The question of the commissariat in Ladysmith now becomes 
if possible of deeper interest than ever and remembering 
the reason assigned for the change in the original plan of 
campaign it is as gratifying as it is surprising to read mes 
sages so late as January 24th speaking of the supplies still 
spinning out splendidly 
MAPEKING 
Again an interesting letter appears in the Tinmes of January 
29th dated Mafeking December x899 in which the writer 
states that  immense stocks of food supplies had been stored 
in the town It is the knowledge of the valuable stores which 
are lying here which has inspired the Boers to court us so 
assiduously From this we may fairly assume that Mafeking 
at least can hold out very much longer if necessary and on 
the other hand if it has been reinforced by the troops from 
Southern Rhodesia as is stated from Transvaal sources it 
may prove a valuable base 
This statement though unconfirmed is not in itself impro 
bable As I pointed out in my last letter one of the difficul 
ties which a force from Rhodesia coming south would have to 
contend with would be a certain amount of malarial fever 
and probably a considerable amount of horse sickness in the 
low country but apparently the greater portion of this low 
country must have been traversed early in the summer and 
at Gaberones the force would be already emerging into the 
higher veld 
TYPHOID AT MODDER RIVER 
Although the health of Lord Methuens force has been 
reported to continue good it is to be noted that on January z8th 
20th and 22ndthree deathsfrom typhoid have beenreported It 
is strongly to be hoped that energetic measures will be taken 
to arrive at the cause and that prevention of further attacks 
will be found practicable 
LYDDITE 
A letter has been received from a correspondent asking as to 
the physiological causes of death after the explosion of a lyd 
dite shell I have raised this question already in one of my 


FEBl 3 900 THE WAR N SOUTH AFRICA rKF  281 
letters and had hoped that some of the readers of the BRITISH 
MEDICAL JOURNAL would have offered explanations Judging 
from the published accounts it would appear that the main 
effects of lyddite are due to shock produced by the concussion 
such as is caused for instance by the explosion of dynamite 
The effect of the explosion of dynamite on man I have observed 
on many occasions The most terrible explosion that ever 
came under my notice and probably the most terrible that 
ever occurred was that in I896 of three trucks laden with 
dynamite which were standing in Johannesburg outside the 
goods station The dynamite was of inferior quality being 
of Transvaal manufacture and the Hollander officials were 
shunting the trucks The result was an explosion which blew 
to powder every house within a radius of some 200 yards which 
wrecked houses for a further radius of 6oo yards and which 
partially wrecked some buildings three quarters of a mile 
away Thus I can well remember that one side of the Wan 
derers Pavilion which was afterwards used as a tempor 
ary hospital three quarters of a mile from the scene 
of the disaster was blown in The effect on men 
women and children in the neighbourhood was ter 
rible Fortunately the houses were scattered and the 
population not dense but some hundred were killed 
and another hundred more or less seriously injured Of those 
killed some showed actual injury from falling stones and 
timber others showed no visible sign of external violence 
Among the wounded were many cases of ruptured tympanum 
with hiemorrhage from the ears The effects I take it were 
due to concussion or in plainer English were the result 
of an actuali blow from the surrounding atmosphere The 
tremendous development of gas produced as in the case of all 
explosives an instantaneous and terrific increase of pressure 
in the atmosphere immediately surrounding the explosion 
It is in this way that lyddite acts and it is pre 
sumably in this way that sheep within an acre of the ex 
plosion of one of our largest shells are said to have been nearly 
all killed 
BOER MEDICAL CORPS 
The Globe of January 25th contains interesting details from 
a letter written to a friend in Berlin by Dr Schneider surgeon 
in chief to the Transvaal forces which I trust Sir James 
Sivewright has read He Dr Schneider says that the 
needs of the Boers with regard to surgeons bearers bandages 
and other appliances are better provided for than is generally 
supposed In I896 to 1897 he remarks incidentally enormous 
stores of arms and ammunition both from England and Ger 
many were imported into the Transvaal and Germanys chief 
share in the work of preparation consisted in supplying the 
Transvaal with surgical instruments drugs and hospital 
appliances To this end 590oco have been spent for the 
Boer Army Medical Service which is now thoroughly 
equipped He says  We have some English surgeons who 
are old settlers in the Transvaal and who have volunteered 
for service in the Transvaal army but the Boer troops show no 
confidence in them 
Referring apparently to the operations around Ladysmith he 
states that the severely wounded are sent by rail to Harrismith 
or to Glencoe as quickly as possible where the Boer women 
have gathered themselves together and friend and foe are 
most carefully attended The writer says that wounded 
Englishmen fall so frequently into their hands that the sur 
geons are most busily engaged withthem The wounded 
have as a rule almost the same treatment there s always 
ready for them a supply of fresh milk bread meat and whole 
some soups It is only natural that we Geiman surgeons 
should give our first attention to the Boers but so far we have 
never forgotten the Englishmen In case of a great battle 
where many on both sides would have to be attended to the 
writer says that  the Boer surgeons would not suffice to meet 
the claims made upon their services and as a matter of 
course would have to leave the wounded English to their 
sufferings This necessity might we suppose arise but it 
must be a painful one for any surgeon with a proper sense of 
the duties of his vocation to anticipate One of the honourable 
traditions of our profession is that such succour as we can 
offer is freely given to friend and foe alike and that a surgeon 
holding a high position even with the Boer forces should 
think it necessary to make the statement quoted above ciuses 
a somewhat painful impression 
THE DESPATCHES 
THE despatches published in the London Gazette of January 
26th dealing with the operations in South Africa down to 
December 28th I899 contain some references to the work of 
the Army Medical Department which are eminently satis 
factory Belmont 
In the action at Belmont on November 23rd in which the 
first movement war made at 3 AM and which terminated at 
about 6IO AM by the capture of the heights and the retreat 
of the enemy the casualties it will be remembered were 
54 killed and 238 wounded In addition 20 of the enemys 
wounded were taken into the British hospital Lord Methuen 
in his despatch of November 26th written from Enslin on 
November 26th writes as follows with regard to the medical 
arrangements of this fight 
 By 1030 my division was in camp by I all my 
wounded were in a comfortable house being carefully 
tended by 5 PM next day the hospital train conveyed the 
less severe cases to Orange River the graver cases to Cape 
town This is the most perfect work 1 have ever heard of in 
war and reflects the highest credit on Colonel Townsend 
Enslin 
In this action the force under Lord Methuen started at 
330 AM on November 25th and was in action at 630 AM Lord 
Mlethuen describes the fight as far harder than at the previous 
engagement The Naval Brigade and the Ninth Brigade were 
left to protect the guns or assault a position if necessary 
the Guards Brigade and two companies of the Munster Fusiliers 
were left to defend Belmont Station The main idea of Lord 
Methuens operation was to march a division at once to 
Swinks Pan to work one battery round each flank and to send 
cavalry and mounted infantry well forward with the object of 
capturing the eastern force The operation was successful 
but the casualties were 24 killed and i66 wounded In addition 
to his own wounded Lord Methuen found over 30 wounded in 
the Boer hospital at Enslin He makes the following observa 
tion with regard to the arrangements carried out by Colonel 
Townsend RAMC 
I again draw attention to the exceptional organising 
power of Colonel Townsend at Swinks Pan At I130 PM 
I was informed that owing to all the ambulances 
having been used for taking the wounded to the train at 
Belmont I had scarcely a field hospital mounted officer only 
three ambulances and three stretchers I knew I had to 
fight next morning so got together fifty blankets in order to 
carry wounded with the help of rifles I also sent to Colonel 
Townsend to make arrangements for wounded by 3 AM a 
messenger having to ride seven miles to him He met me on 
the field with a full supply of ambulances and I never saw 
anything more of him or the wounded because he had a train 
ready for them between Grass Pan and Belmont His only 
complaint is that there is not much of his mules left an 
observation which applies equally to men and animals 
Modder River 
In this action which was fought on November 28th begin 
ning at 4 AM the number of casualties was 72 killed and 396 
wounded Lord Methuen concludes his despatch by the follow 
ing observation of the work of the Royal Army Medical Corps 
 Again I call attention to the splendid hospital arrangements 
for at 445 PM on the day after the fight all my wounded were 
on the way to Capetown I am glad to have been slightly 
wounded because in no other way could I have learnt the 
care taken of the wounded and there was nothing officer or 
private soldier required that was not provided at once and the 
medical officers never tired in their endeavour to alleviate 
suffering 
The despatch also contains the following mention 
 He Colonel Paget draws attention to Captain Moores 
R AMC who although wounded in the hand said nothing 
but continued his duties 
Natal 
Sir Redvers Bullers despatch with regard to the reverse at 
Colenso does not contain any reference to the work of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps or of the hospitals but Major 
General Elildyard in his report on the night attack on Beacon 
Hill near Estcourt Natal on November igth states that

Major Rickets commanded the bearer company and did 
good service both at the time and in connection with the 
removal of the wounded 
It will be remembered that the force by which the attack 
was made was under the command of Colonel Kitchener 
Early in the night there was a storm of extreme severity 
and the men lying out in it amongst the rocks were exposed 
to its full force The hill was successfully taken and some 
thirty horses captured but in accordance with instructions 
was at once evacuated Owing to the nature of the ground 
it would appear that there was considerable difficulty in re 
moving our wounded The cavalry under LieutenantColonel 
Martyr assisted in the work of getting the woundedof the 
2nd Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment down the hill 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF WOUNDED 
The casualty lists issued by the War Office usually contain 
indications of the severity of the wounds received As the 
system of classification followed is probably not generally 
understood it may be of interest to explain it 
 Wounded is used as an inclusive term and gives no 
indication of the severity of the injury It is used only in 
preliminary statements forwarded home before the medical 
officers have had time to examine all the wounded and make 
a classified term 
Three classes of wounds are recognised Dangerous 
severe and  slight  but if a man is dangerously wounded 
and likely to die it is usual to state that his wound is  pro 
bably mortal The actual classification is of course made by 
the medical officer on the spot 
It is impossible to attempt to specify the nature of the 
wounds which would fall into these several classes but it 
may be said that a simple flesh wound would be entered as 
slight a wound implicating bone or joint would be entered as 
severe and a wound penetrating the abdomen chest and 
brain would be entered as dangerous 
THE YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
ALL the arrangements for the despatch of the Yeomanry 
Hospital to South Africa are now in an advanced state The 
entire male personnel 150 in number including the medical 
officers and ten dressers will go by the Majestic which is ex 
pected to reach England very shortly She will take some 
days to coal and clean but it is hoped that she may be ready 
to sail or February ioth or 12th The nurses will follow on 
February ioth on a liner as neither the Majestic nor any other 
transport has accommodation for ladies With the nurses will 
go about ten female servants and ward maids The mat6riel 
of the hospital is timed to arrive before the staff who will find 
sufficient accommodation in the form of huts and tents already 
erected 
The site of the hospital has not yet been quite definitely 
settled there seems to be some possibility that it will be 
established at De Aar or some other advanced point on the 
lines of communication of the strong force which it is be 
lieved will now be pushed forward through the southern 
border of the Free State according to the original plan of cam 
paign Of course the ultimate site of the hospital will be 
determined by the CommanderinChief Lord Roberts and the 
Principal Medical Officer SurgeonGeneral Wilson In any 
case this hospital will be of the nature of a base hospital as 
is sufficiently shown by the fact that it has a staff of lady 
nurses who are not employed in field or stationaiy hospitals 
near the actual front 
There is a proposal to provide a Yeomanry Field Hospital 
but this we understand has not yet taken definite shape 
The medical staff which has been selected from a very large 
number who have offered their services is very strong and 
efficient and Mr Fripp is to be congratulated on the successful 
completion of this somewhat difficult initial task He has 
been presented by the Princess Christian with a very com 
plete dressing case filled with instruments for his personal 
use 
Mr L Vernon Cargill FRCSEng Assistant Ophthalmic 
Surgeon to Kings College Hospital will be in charge of the 
ophthalmological department and the Roentgen ray depart 
ment will be under the direction of Mr J F HallEdwards 
LRCP Surgeon Radiographer to the General Hospital 
Birmingham who has authority to obtain all the necessary 
appliances 
The staff of nurses has been carefully selected and we 
understand that LieutenantColonel A T Sloggett RAMC 
tlle military medical officer in command is very well satisfied 
with the noncommissioned officers and hospital orderlies who 
have been attached to the hospital 
The public has responded generously to the appeal for funds 
and in addition a very large proportion of the equipment of 
the hospital has been given The various firms that cater for 
the wants of the medical profession have been second to none 
in their generosity and Messrs Down Brothers who are sup 
plying the instruments at prices very advantageous to the 
hospital have presented a quantity of enamelled metal furni 
ture for the operating theatre including a  raise and lower 
operating table 
The following additional appointments completing the 
medical staff have been made 
Mr L Vernon Cargill FRCSEng Assistant Ophthalmic Surgeon to 
Kings College Hospital Mr John F HallEdwards LROP Surgeon

arrangements for its departure to the front 
HOSPITAL ARRANGEMENTS 
Captain E G Powell RAMC now doing duty with the Coldstream 
Guards has been selected for service with Mr Van Alens hospital about 
to go to South Afrfca 
Tle three bearer companies and three field hospitals to be attached to

THE ARMY NURSING SERVICE AND RESERVE 
IN view of the interest taken in all matters affecting the wel 
fare of the sick and wounded at the present time it seems 
well to give the following particulars as to the qualification 
of candidates for the Army Nursing Service and the Army 
Nursing Reserve and of their conditions of service 
THE ARMY NURSING SERVICE 
The Nursing Service of the army is classified as follows 
i Lady superintendent of nurses 2 superintendents 3 
nursing sisters The two former classes are as a rule but not 
necessarily each filled up from the grade below it by selec 
tion on grounds of experience administrative capacity and 
personal fitness 
QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES 
A candidate for the appointment of superintendent or nursing sister 
must not be under 25 or over 3o years of age and must have had at least 
three years preliminary training and service combined in a civil general 
hospital She must also be of Br itish parentage or a naturalised British 
subject and will be required to produce

accompany the declaration form which will be supplied to candidates by 
the DirectorGeneral Army Medical Department 
On being nominated for an appointment a candidate will be required to 
undergo a period of six montlhs probation at the Royal Victoria Hospital 
Netley for the purpose of further testing her suitability for the Army 
Nursing Service 
THE ARMY NURSING SERVICE RESERVE 
The Army Nursing Reserve is formed for the purpose of 
supplementing the regular nursing service of the army in the 
event of war on any extended scale In time of peace it is 
under the control of a specially constituted Committee of 
which HRH Princess Christian of SchleswigHolstein is 
President but in time of war the nursing sisters are entirely 
under the control of the War Department 
The Army Nursing Reserve consists of IOO or more nursing 
sisters a certain number of whom may be detailed by the 
military authorities as acting superintendents As a rule 
the sisters are only expected to replace in military hospitals 
at home those members of the regular army nursing service 
ordered abroad but in case of pressing emergency a certain 
proportion selected from volunteers are called upon to pro

LITERARY NOTES 
THE new German Pharmacopaeia will probably not be pub 
lished till March or April 
For many years Greek practitioners have had no Pharma 
copaeia to guide them in prescribing Dr A Damberghis 
Professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry in the University of 
Athens has now supplied this want His work has been 
recognised by decree of the Minister of the Interior as the 
official Greek Pharmacopcaia 
We are glad to learn that Sir Joseph Fayrer Bart KOSI 
has written his Reminiscences They ought to form a very 
interesting book Sir Joseph Fayrer is we believe one of the 
very few men who have held a commission in the medical 
services of the navy and of the army and in the Indian 
Medical Service The greater part of his service however 
was in India and the story of his life contains many stirring 
episodes He was in Rome in the troubled times of I84849 
saw service in the first Burmese war and was one of the 
beleaguered garrison in Lucknow all through the memorable 
siege of that town during the mutiny The volume which 
will contain some twenty or thirty illustrations will we 
understand be published very shortly by Messrs Blackwood 
Dr S G Zervos of Athens claims for Hippocrates the 
honour and glory of having discovered the therapeutic useful 
ness of the wet compress which is generally attributed to 
Priessnitz the apostle of the water cure In proof of this claim 
he cites the following passage from the Father of Medicine 
Littrd Euvres ComplTtes dHippocrate t ii p 269 
In pain of the side  it is not inappropriate to use in the first instance 
fomentations with the object of relieving it Of fomentations the most 
potent is hot water enclosed in a leather bottle  It is well also to 
apply a large soft sponge steeped in hot water and squeezed out the 
fomentation should be covered with cloths in this way the heat will be 
lon ger maintained 
The late Dr William A Hammond like that other eminent 
neurologist Dr WeirMitchell took to the writing of fiction 
in his later years His first novel entitled Lal achieved 
considerable success It was followed by four or five others 
which were not equally appreciated by the reading public
