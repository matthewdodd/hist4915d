than it is here the money would be given for such a purpose 
without hesitation Unfortunately the British elector has 
not yet been educated to the proper appreciation of suchthings 
and as there are no votes to be won or lost in connection with 
the matter the Government is not likely to think it worth 
risking even a few questions from Parliamentary busybodies 
upon it The present Secretary of State for the Colonies has 
however shown a statesmanlike comprehension of the mani 
fold factors which make the prosperity of the Empire and this 
encourages the expectation that he will look favourably 
upon a scheme likely to be so directly useful in the work of 
colonisation 
MEDICAL WAR NEWS 
RETURN OF THE  SOLACE  FROM KEY WEST 
THE United States Hospital ship Solace returned to New York 
on June 5th from Key West bringing 54 men belonging to 
the various warships who have been invalided either on 
aecount of illness or from wounds received in the bombard 
ments in which the vessels have recently been engaged 
Four of the men were sufferiDg from tuberculosis Four 
surgeons eight trained nurses and three apothecaries looked 
after the welfare of the sick and wounded during the trip 
Ambulances from the Naval Hospital were awaiting the 
arrival of the vessel to transfer the patients The men have 
improved very rapidly since leaving the enervating climate of 
Key West 
SANITARY DiPWICULTIES OF A CUBAN INVASION 
A meeting of American and Cuban physicians who have 
enlisted in the Red Cross Service was recently held to discuss 
the sanitary problems presented by an invasion of Caba Dr 
E Nufiez at one time Director of the Hospital of our Mother 
in Havana presided Dr Juan de Sollossa formerly a 
surgeon in the Spanish army acted as Spanish Becretary 
and Dr F B Carpenter was the English Secretary From 
statements made by Drs Francis Rivera F Marill Julius 
Carbonnell and C R Gill it appeared that in the Caban war 
75 per cent of the Spanish army suffered from endemic 
disease so per cent from yellow fever about equally divided 
between mild and serious cases and 25 per cent from 
malarial fever Dr Sollossa said that before the war 30 per 
cent of all foreigners suffered from these diseases and the 
mortality was about io per cent During the war the percent 
age of deaths in the army from disease alone was more than 
25 per cent With improved hygienic measures this death 
rate could be considerably reduced During the first three 
months of the year there was little yellow fever in April 
May June and July more cases occurred though they were 
not numerous and from the end of August to the 
middle of November the disease was most prevalent 
and severe By taking proper precautions those who 
had good health during the early months could usually 
escape an attack during the unhealthy months Malarial 
fever was most prevalent during the rainy season Dr A M 
Lesser SurgeoninChief of the American Red Cross Society 
said that diseases were most prevalent near the coast and in 
large cities Six to twelve miles from the coast at an alti 
tude of IxoOo feet all persons were comparatively immune 
The mountains were easy of access and could be used for 
hospitals as far as the conditions of war permitted In the 
quartering of soldiers it was especially advisable to avoid the 
cities and if they were encamped in tents it was essential 
that the tents should be impervious to the heavy dews It 
was to be remembered that any person suffering from yellow 
fever or severe malarial fever would be unfit for duty for at 
least six or seven weeks so that unless the most careful sani 
tary precautions were taken only a portion of the army could 
be counted on for regular duty the rest being under hospital 
treatment As regards the relative healthfulness of Cuba and 
Tampa and Key West all the physicians present agreed that 
the climate of Florida was worse than that of the higher por 
tions of Cuba and that it would be better to keep the ill and 
wounded on high ground in Cuba than to remove them to 
Florida thus subjecting them to the dangers of seasickness 
in addition to less salubrious conditions on their arrival

MEDICAL AID IN A MODERN NAVAL BATTLE 
In the Medical News of June iith Dr Raymond Spear 
assistantsurgeon USN of the New York gives an interest 
ing account of medical aid during an action at sea in the 
present war When  general quarters  is sounded the sick 
bay is immediately converted into an operating room an 
operating table is placed in the centre the ordinary instru 
ments for amputating limbs are arranged in trays and im 
mediately disinfected by steam aseptic dressings are laid 
out and antiseptic solutions prepared for immediate use 
In former times during an action the doctors remained in the 
sick bay and the wounded were brought to them but con 
ditions have changed and now on a ship like the New York 
where there is practically no protected place during an action 
this is impossible 
The greatest loss of life in battle is from loss of blood 
Some authorities estimate the loss of life from haemorrhage 
alone as 75 per cent of the total The following is Dr Spears 
description of the method to be adopted 
The crew of each gun receives linstruction in first aid to the wounded 
by the medical officers Each gun has its own outfit of rubber tubing 
and packages of aseptic dressings The men are instructed how to apply 
the rubber tubing to the limbs in order to arrest hemorrhage how to 
apply aseptic dressings being especially cautioned against touching 
wounds and finally how to support limbs when broken and how to carry 
the wounded and where to place them 
Each deck of the New York is divided up into several compartments 
separated by watertight bulkheads During an action these bulkheads 
are closed Under these conditions the medical officers cannot reach all 
of the wounded if they are in different compartments therefore if a man 
be injured sufficiently to be disabled he is attended to by some of his 
companions If an extremity be badly injured a piece of rubber tubing 
is applied so as to arrest hssmorrhage an aseptic dressing is applied the 
leg is bound to the other one for support or the arm is bound to the body 
if tractured the man is placed in a hammock and dragged to the best 
protected place near by where he will not be in the way and here he 
waits for the surgeon The wounded are placed athwart ships if possible 
thus offering the smallest possible target for the shells that comethrough 
the ships sie 
The doctors take their stations in the most protected parts of the ship 
namely behind the turrets and here establish dressing stations and 
attend to all the wounded in the immediate vicinity The surgeons have 
received orders to expose themselves as little as possible during action 
as their real work begins when the light is over Each surgeon earries a 
haversack in which are pieces of rubber tubing for controlling hnmor 
rhaesfromtheextremitieshsemostaticsapocketcasehypodermi syringe 
and solutions of strychnine and morphine readyfor hypodermic use 
and some firstaid packages Stationed with each doctor is a nurse who 
carries in a knapsack surgical dressings antiseptic solutions whisky etc 
When the action is over the surgeons will take a hasty survey ot the

wounded and give such attention as is absolutely necessary to each 
When the wounded have been attended to those cases needing imme 
diate operation will be looked after three operating tables being estab 
lished if necessary The wounded will not be disturbed but will await 
the arrivial of the hospital ship Solace and will then be transferred to 
her where they will receive medical attention during their transporta 
tion to the hospitals in Key West 
THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 
THE fortyninth annual meeting of the American Medical 
Association was held at Denver Colorado on June 7th 8th 
9th ioth There was a large attendance more than IIOO 
delegates having registered their names on the morning of the 
first day In the absence of the President SurgeonGeneral 
Sternberg owing to  imperative official duties the chair 
was taken at the first general session by First VicePresident 
Dr JOSEPH M MATHEWS of Louisville Kentucky 
FIRST GENERAL SESSION 
Pre8idet8 AddressThe Presidents address was read by 
Colonel A A WOODHULL of the United States army In it 
the view was expressed that the day was perhaps not far 
distant when no reputable physician would be willing to con 
fess that he did not belong to the American Medical Associa 
tion anid when no progressive physician could afford to do 
without the Journal of that body The President went on to 
say that the medical profession in the United States had 
suffered more from the ignorance of some of its members 
who held diplomas from regular schools of medicine than from 
the attacks of those whom they called irregulars or quacks 
To maintain their standing in the estimation of the educated 
classes they must not rely upon their diplomas or upon their 
membership in medical societies but must show themselves 
superior in knowledge and in professional resources to the 
ignorant pretenders and to the graduates of a medical school 
which was bound in its teachings by an untenable creed 
There were those who still spoke of  old school physicians  
ignorant apparently of the fact that scientific medicine was 
to a great extent of very recent origin and that all great dis 
coveries in relation to the etiology prevention and specific 
treatment of infectious diseases and nearly all the Improved 
methods and instrumental appliances for clinical diagnosis 
and surgical treatment had their origin within the ranks of 
the regular profession If they were to be characterised by 
any distinctive name the only one applicable would be  the 
new school of scientific medicine Not that science was 
complete for they had still many things to learn and many 
problems which had thus far resisted all efforts at their 
solution But they had learned how to attack these pro 
blems and no one any longer expected that they could be 
solved by the exercise of the reasoning powers and the facile 
use of the pen The old saying that  the pen is mightier 
than the sword  was no doubt true in politics but in science 
the pen was a feeble instrument compared with the test tube 
the microscope the chemical balance etc Nevertheless 
he advised wellinformed physicians to make greater use 
of the pen not for the elucidation of those problems 
which remained to be solved but for the purpose of 
calling the attention of the nonmedical portion of the com 
munity to the recent achievements of scientific medicine 
Having referred to the injurious consequences of premature 
and unfounded opinions especially when given by men of 
prominence  in the profession the President proceeded 
to call attention to the best method of counteracting such 
mischief This was undoubtedly by united action on the 
prt of the more enlightened members of the profession in 
behalf of truth and progress This assistance they had had 
in combating the Antivivisection Bill introduced into the 
United States Senate and vigorously pressed by the members 
of the Washington Humane Society and their misguided 
friends throughout the country The result showed that 
when exercised in a humane cause the influence of the 
medical profession was a factor which would not be ignored 
even by the Senate of the United States Dr Sternberg then 
passed in rapid review the principal discoveries in the 
etiology of disease in therapeutics and in preventive medi 
eane made in recent years and concluded by insisting that 
there was no room for creeds and  pathies  in medicine any 
maore than in astronomy geology or botany No restriction 
was placed upon any physician who graduated from the 
regular schools as to the mode of treatment he should pursue 
in any given case If he saw fit to prescribe a bread pill or a 
hundredth trituration of carbo vegetabilis there was no pro 
fessional rule of ethics to prevent him from doing so But 
if his patient died from diphtheria because of his failure to 
administer a proper remedy or if he recklessly infected a 
wound with dirty fingers or instruments or transferred 
pathogenic streptococci from a case of phlegmonous ery 
sipelas to the interior of the uterus of a puerperal woman it 
would appear that the courts should have something to say 
as to his fitness to practise medicine 
REPORT OF THE RUSH MONUMENT COMMITTEE 
Dr A L GIHON chairman of the Rush Monument Com 
mittee reported that in spite of the fact that at the last 
meeting of the Association held in Philadelphia it had been 
decided that iooooo should be raised for the erection of a
