SLIGHTER BULLET WOUNDS 
OutPatients 
The graver varieties of gunshot wounds naturally attract chief 
attention but the slighter injuries have also a peculiar in 
terest in the present campaign The recoveries are indeed 
often so remarkable that the term 
 
slight injury is a very 
elastic one and must be construed only as signifying that the 
patient is likely within two months to be able to return to 
active duty Through the kindness of Major Browning 
RAMC I was enabled to see all the cases of gunshot 
wounds in the Fort and Lower Barracks Hospital at Pieter 
maritzburg the men being specially paraded for the purpose 
The bulk of these had been wounded in the action at Colenso 
on December 15th and were seen about four weeks later 
Practically and in civilian phraseology they were out 
patients Many of the cases were simple flesh wounds that 
had healed at once and completely without any trouble The 
extent of extravasation in some of these cases was noteworthy 
and suggested that the injury was by no means confined simply 
to the parts traversed 
Flesh Wounds 
The hard cicatriciai cord resulting from the passage of the 
Mauser ballet was often more marked when the bullet had 
traversed a large muscle In a remarkable number of the 
cases the wounds were of the thigh and in the close proximity 
of the femoral vessels The apertures of entrance and exit 
resembled each other absolutely In a case in which the 
gluteal region was traversed on both sides the four wounds 
were ail exactly alike Cases in which great and persistent 
pain follows a flesh wound where the bullet has passed close 
to a nerve have been already mentioned in a previous letter 
Such are very common but were naturally not among the 
patients attending medical inspection 
Wounds f the Hand and Wrist and Foot 
In a fewa very fewinstances fingers had been ampu 
tated but more it seemed with the object of giving the most 
useful hand possible than because the injury of the bones of 
the finger or phalangeal joints was such that local recovery 
could not take place or because any septic complications 
threatened One man had threelfingers wounded The bullet 
grazed the skin over the back of the little finger and just 
grooved the proximal phalangesof the third and fourth on the 
back The wounds healed at once but the power of extension 
was much impaired Such grooving of the shafts of the 
longer bones appears to be rare  usually a fragment is broken 
off The small bones of the carpus and tarsus are constantly 
drilled without any apparent comminution by the Mauser 
bullet Thus one patient showed a transverse wound of the 
anterior half of the tarsus  the wound healed throughout at 
once In another case the entrance wound was over the 
middle cuneiform bone and the exit through the os calcis 
The bullet probably traversed the scaphoid and astragalus as 
well as the two bones named There was no impairment of the utility of the foot When the small diameter and the 
rapid rotation of the Mauser bullet are taken into consideration it is of course not very remarkable that so little mischief is 
caused The injury to the bones is scarcely greater than is in 
volved in inserting a screw for fixing together the fragments in 
a bad fracture or a broken olecranon So long as the wound is 
aseptic no harm should result and in the great majority of 
Mauser bullet wounds the track is perfectly aseptic from the 
first apart from treatment 
Wounds of the Patella and KneeJoint 
Many cases have been noted in which the patella has been 
cleanly drilled through by bullets Such cases almost uni 
formly do well unless complicated with injuryjf the popliteal 
vessels or nerve Extensive hsemarthrosis may form in the 
knee but subsides without trouble A man with a wound of 
the knee received about a month previously illustrated this 
The bullet had passed through the patella obliquely and 
made its exit on the outer side of the joint No trace of the 
injury to the bone could be felt and the joint in which there 
had been considerable effusion of blood was perfectly mov 
able In one case at Wynberg the bullet a LeeMet ford 
caused a transverse fracture of the patella In this instance 
the entrance wound was in the popliteal space I have not 
been able to hear of any other cases of fracture of the patella 
though very possibly some will come to light hereafter The 
contrast between the results of wounds of the kneejoint in 
this and previous wars will certainly prove very striking 
Heating of the Mauser Bullet 
A curious case of possible burn from a bullet was shown in 
a wound received by a corporal in the Queens Regiment The 
bullet possibly a spent one had struck the shaft of the tibia 
close to the crest transversely and apparently had drilled the 
bone There was a little irregularity of the bone and a frag 
ment may have been displaced Close to the exit wound was 
a mark resembling a burn the extent and shape of a 
bullet The patients account was that he had felt 
himself hit and felt something burning his leg On 
removing the puttie the bullet was found lying under 
neath it The man stated that it was ured hot a perhaps 
pardonable exaggeration The bullet at any rate was too 
hot to hold in the hand without pain The bullet was not a 
ricochet in appearance Another patient gave a somewhat 
similar account In this instance the bullet entered i inch 
to the right side of the eighth dorsal spine and made its exit 
3 inches below the clavicle on the same side without travers 
ing the thoracic cavity The bullet dropped down inside the 
shirt and burnt the skin of the abdomen The bullet was 
found inside the clothes a day or two later Such accounts 
have to be received with a certain amount of caution but 
undoubtedly the mark on the skin of the abdomen did re 
semble a burn It is often supposed popularly that the tem 
perature of bullets is greatly raised by the friction of the air 
The supposition does not seem to rest on an experimental 
basis Arrest of movement would develop heat of course 
but the prodigious range of the smallbore bullet shows that 
the friction is exceedingly slight Markers at rifle butts are 
familiar with the fact that ricochet shots which are recog 
nised by the peculiar hum they make in passing through the 
air and which often fall deadby the shelters or drop back off 
the target if picked up at once are warm or even hot  but in 
such cases the movement has been violently arrested 
It is possible that some heat might be developed 
by the arrest of the bullet by the clothing but in 
such a case the missile cannot have been travelling 
with any great velocity A ricochet shot loses the spin in its 
longitudinal axis that it acquires in passing through the rifled 
barrel but as it glances off after the impact it may revolve on 
a transverse axis turning over and over in its night It is 
therefore unlikely to make the small wounds of entrance and 
exit characteristic of the perfect smallbore bullet Moreover the nickel sheath of the bullet will probably split up as the 
bullet strikes the earth and bounds up or glances from it It 
is occasionally stated that the cicatricial cord resulting from 
the passage of a smallbore bullet through soft tissues is due to 
the cauterising action of the bullet Such a view is hardly to 
be taken seriously The cicatrix resembles no doubt that 
which might be caused by passing a thick galvanic wire 
through the tissues and then raising it to a temperature suffi 
cient to burn the tissues But the cicatrix of a bullet wound 
is not produced in that way The velocity with which it 
passes through the tissues is too great to allow time for any 
cauterising action even if the bullet were at white heat 
Injuries of the Head and Neck 
The injuries of the head and neck were not numerous A 
private showed a wound of the side of the neck The exit 
wound was into the pharynx and the man spat up the bullet 
Instances of the kind were numerous enough in the days of 
round bullets and low velocity but are not likely to occur 
often with modern firearms Another patient showed a trans 
verse linear scar over the frontal sinus The bone beneath 
was deeply and irregularly grooved and evidently the anterior 
plate of the bone had been rather extensively fractured be

having like the inner table of the calvarium in cases of 
gutter fracture No trouble had resulted save rather pro 
fuse epistaxis and apparently the injury to the supraorbital 
nerve did not threaten any evil consequences 
Wounds of the Thorax 
A private in the Kings Royal Rifles was wounded at the 
action of Elandslaagte by a bullet which traversed the scapula 
and thorax Some haemoptysis followed the injury but there 
was no other untoward symptom The wound healed through 
out at once soundly Many of the patients with similar in 
juries though apparently completely recovered are troubled 
with shortness of breath on slight exertion and this seems 
usually to be the case where both lungs have been traversed 
even when there has been no pneumothoraxwhich is 
seldom seenor hsemothorax a complication which occurs 
pretty frequently 
Wounds of the Liver 
Another private also wounded at Elandslaagte had a more 
extensive wound The bullet entered in front close to the 
right side of the sternum on a level with the seventh costal 
cartilage The exit wound was seen 3 inches above the right 
sacroiliac joint The possibility of the wounds in such cases 
being caused by different bullets must always be taken into 
consideration seeing that in a vast number of cases there is 
no appreciable distinction between the apertures of entrance 
and exit  but in this case there seemed no doubt that the 
bullet had traversed the right lung and the liver The direc 
tion of the wound corresponded to the position the man was 
in when the wound was received The wound had healed 
throughout without causing any trouble at all In another 
case in which the bullet had probably traversed the upper 
part of the liver superficially there had been some hsemat 
emesis but practically no other symptom 
Wounds of the Intestine 
In the following case the small intestine was probably 
wounded The injury was sustained at the action of Colenso 
on December 15th The Mauser bullet entered close to the 
posterior superior spine of the ilium on the right side The 
exit was on much the same horizontal level between 3 and 
4 inches from the umbilicus and to its left It is almost 
inconceivable therefore that the small intestine could have 
escaped injury The man had been without any food for 
many hours before the wound was received and stated that 
at the time the abdomen was collapsed No vomiting 
followed the injury but for two days there was much disten 
sion This latter symptom gradually passed off and recovery 
took place uninterruptedly Four days after the injury the 
man according to his own account was able to walk about 
having probably noted the absence of the medical officer 
and nursing sister Whether true or not it is at least 
possible in the absence of any specific orders being given to 
the orderly to keep the patient in bed For the best of hos 
pital orderlies do not watch their patients with the unweary 
ing and intelligent attention so characteristic of a good 
trained nurse In this instance no operation was done I can 
recall only a very few similar instances of recovery where the 
small intestine was presumably wounded Cases in which 
the large gut was injured as far as could be judged followed 
by complete recovery are rare but moire common Full sta 
tistics are needed before the question of operative interference 
in gunshot wound of the abdomen can be properly discussed 
and these are not yet to hand The impression at present 
seems to be that the results of laparotomy have not so far 
been encouraging Everything depends however on the 
time that elapses between the infliction of the wound and the 
laparotomy Hitherto as far as I have been able to ascer 
tain the time that has elapsed has been so considerable that 
the chance of recovery was but remote Very protracted oper 
ations are hardly feasible in a field hospital when there is any 
rush of wounded and by the time that the patient has been 
transported to some place where there is opportunity for per 
forming the exploration with due deliberation the most 
favourable moment has passed and the difficulties to the oper 
ator are vastly increased Moreover as the above and other 
cases show recovery may take place in cases in which if they 
were seen in civil hospitals soon after the injury exploration 
would in most instances be advised

THE HOSPITAL SHIPS AT DURBAN NATAL 
By Sir William Stokes MD FRCSI 
Surgeon in Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland and Consulting Surgeon to 
the Field Forces in South Africa 
Pietermaritzburg Natal February 7th 1900 
On February 2nd accompanied by Major MacCormac 
RAMC Senior Medical Officer Durban I visited and 
inspected the four hospital ships then stationed in the 
harbour at Durban These were the Nubia the Maine the 
Lismore Castle and the Avoca The first and two latter of 
these have in an incredibly short timeabout ten days I 
heardbeen converted from passenger and troop ships into 
floating hospitals The transformation was effected entirely 
at Durban In the firstnamed vessel 216 patients were 
accommodated of whom 100 were convalescents The light 
space ventilation baths liftsworked by handfrom one 
deck to another movable electric fans swinging cots etc 
showed that there were few requirements unthoughtof to 
secure the comfort of the patients Colonel Hodder had the 
medical and surgical care of the patients assisted by four 
civil practitioners 
Dr Ashton showed me two very remarkable cases that were 
under his care both happily convalescent In the first case 
the bullet entered about  an inch to the right of the eighth 
or ninth dorsal spinous process and passing through the 
lung emerged i inch below and to the right of the right 
nipple The patient had some slight haemoptysis after he 
was wounded but since that no bad symptoms whatever In 
another case the bullet entered about 1 inch below the spine 
of the right scapula and emerged a little to the left of the 
sacrum The length of the traverse of the bullet was i8 
inches The wound in this case remained perfectly aseptic 
and is now quite healed the patient does not suffer any 
inconvenience except occasional pain which he refers to the 
lumbar region In the Lismore Castle and Avoca the arrange 
ments for the comfort and convenience of the patients were 
most satisfactory Dr Brodie with three assistants has 
medical charge of the first of these It has accommodation 
for 264 cases  of these 150 were convalescents and 114 under 
treatment or  
cot cases 
 
as they are termed In the officers 
quarters there were 16 cases of which 4 were  
cot cases and 
the remainder convalescents 
Dr Hamilton one of the assistants showed me some very 
remarkable cases The first was a multiple injury the 
patient having been shot in four different places namely 
through the neck the right knee the leit leg and the fore 
arm He is rapidly recovering from all these injuries In 
another case the ball penetrated the nose down to the frontal 
bone passed downwards perforating the hard palate and ulti 
mately emerged at the left side of the neck without injuring 
the tongue or lower jaw The third case was a very sad one 
The bullet penetrated the lower dorsal spine Immediate 
paralysis of the left lower limb followed the right lower limb 
remaining normal 
The last case I saw on the Lismore Castle was to my mind 
the most remarkable of all The bullet struck and penetrated 
the forehead on the left side high up and emerged at the ver 
tex a little to the right of the occipital protuberance The 
only result of this wound was total blindness of the left eye 
with optic atrophy 
1 next visited the Maine which is under the direction of 
Lady Randolph Churchill and is organised and financed by 
American ladies The vessel had just arrived from Cape 
town and was not yet ready for the reception of patients 
There is accommodation for 187 patients Although the 
arrangements were still in a state of unpreparedness owing 
to the vessel having just arrived it was obvious that little or 
nothing had been omitted that experience knowledge and 
apparently unlimited financial resources could procure 
There were spring beds of the latest design thick indiarub 
ber matting on each side of the beds ingeniously constructed 
bed tables and head rests electric fans etc The strong 
electric lights were modified by elegantly designed green 
shades all of which Lady Randolph Churchill told me were 
manufactured by Mrs Joseph Chamberlain There are elec 
tric cooking appliances of all kinds refrigerators and floral and 
foliage decorations in abundance In fact everything that

could be suggested for the comfort of the patients was to be 
found 
The medical and surgical staff with Colonel Hens man at 
their head consist of fortyv persons  there are five sur 
geons five sisters the remainder being orderlies and nurses 
The nursing staff is under the skilful direction of Lady 
Randolph Churchill Messrs Burroughs Wellcomeand Co 
who have furnished the medicine in the dispensary have pre 
sented a very beautiful and ingeniouslyconstructed cabinet 
fitted with medicines in the convenient tabloid form On the 
outside of the cabinet is the appropriate motto 
 
No distance 
breaks the tie of blood In addition to the fittings and ap 
pliances already mentioned there are baths for fever cases and 
provision is also made for Roentgenray photography The 
operating theatre has all the most recent appliances furniture 
of metal and glass and perfect arrangements for sterilising 
instruments dressings etc If anything could be fairly 
criticised about the Maine it would certainly not be in 
reference to its fittings and arrangements but the vessel it 
self does not compare favourably with the other hospital 
vessels I inspected The low ceilings between decks and the 
small port windows appeared to me to be structural defects 
likely to interfere with both ventilation and light Lady 
Randolph Churchill most kindly spared no pains or trouble to 
let me see all the admirable arrangements she has made and 
I cannot speak too highly of them 
Were it not that this communication has already reached 
too great a length I should like to mention several cases of 
gunshot wounds I have seen Many of these are of absorbing 
interest and the results likely to be hardly credible to those 
who have not seen them  but later on I hope to forward you 
memoranda of some of these that I have seen and been con 
sulted on Many of them will doubtless furnish problems 
the solution of which will test the ingenuity skill and re 
sources both of the physiologist and pathologist 
THE HOSPITALS AT RONDEBOSCH 
From Our Special Correspondent at Capetown 
February 20th 1900 
Enteric Fever 
At present things are still fairly quiet at the general hospitals 
The cases cleared out of the advance hospitals preparatory to 
Lord Robert8s brilliant march were not generally of much in 
terest and were mostly convalescent and the casualties 
hitherto in that march have been infinitesimal A few cases 
have come down from the Colesberg operations and will be 
dealt with later when I come to speak of the Rondeboseh hos 
pitals whither most of them have gone 
The influx of cases from the front has generally more of a 
medical than a surgical aspect Enterics are coming in pretty 
freely to all the general hospitals most of them of course in a 
convalescing stage Still they are not in sufficient quantity 
to shake ones belief in the sanitary arrangements at the 
front At this time of year enteric is more or less rife all over 
the country and to expect freedom from it in camps would be 
to expect the unattainable The station hospital is getting 
 a good number of cases in the earlier stages from the camps 
at Green Point and Maitland and from the various stations 
along the railway line Four cases of this affection landed 
from the Australian transport a few days ago Three of them 
commenced to be ill some ten days after commencing the 
voyage the fourth only a few days before landing The three 
first cases are convalescing steadily The other cases of 
enteric recently admitted have been of a somewhat severe 
type generally It is noticeable that at all the hospitals a 
large number of typhoid cases persist in a prolonged pyrexia 
of an erratic character the temperature in the fourth fifth 
or sixth weeks running up to 103o or so every evening with a 
drop nearly to normal in the mornings for a few days  then 
the range becomes less the maximum being perhaps ioo for 
a few days more but then mounting again This constantly 
happens without any perceptible explanatory complication and with the utmost care in diet and regimen Exactly the 
some thing is observed in civil practice One case died at 
the Station Hospital last week Violent haemorrhage came 
on on the twelfth day and later symptoms of perforation with 
localised peritonitis The case had been hitherto a mild one 
with only very moderate diarrhoea At the necropsy a per 
foration quite the size of a shilling was found just above the 
ileocsecal valve This perforation was evidently through a 
gangrenous patch and a plugged vessel around it The 
Peyer patch lesions corresponded to the assumed date of the 
disease The medical officer in charge of the enteric ward 
informs me that he finds nothing controls diarrhoea in 
typhoid fever so effectively as the indigenous drug Monsonia 
which I mentioned in my last letter 
Enteric Fever in the Inoculated 
At No 3 General Hospital where there are a large numbe 
of cases of enteric fever a certain proportion of whom 
have been inoculated it is very instructive to note the tem 
perature chart8 In all the inoculated cases which I have 
seen except one the temperature has dropped steadily and 
punctually at the fourteenth day or thereabouts and has 
j never gone up again The uninoculated cases run on with 
the erratic temperatures I have described before At Ronde 
bosch the favourite drug in typhoid fever appears to be salol 
but I think most of the elder hands at all the hospitals have 
very little faith left in drugs except in complications 
The New Bearer Companies 
Some modification of the arrangements with reference to 
the recently raised bearer companies has been made D Com 
pany went up a few days ago under Major Nicol RAMC 
but it has been taken over bodily by the officers of one of the 
RAMC companies and Major Nicol has just returned He 
is to take permanent command of E and his senior sub 
altern will be SurgeonLieutenant Vaux of the Royal 
Canadian Medical Corps The junior will be Lieutenant 
Fryer whom I mentioned last week SurgeonCaptain Black 
on account of a breakdown in his health is not able to go to 
the front after all E Company Medical Staff Corps leaves 
tonight or tomorrow Both these newlyraised companies 
present a very creditable appearance and will be very fit for 
bearer work 
Movements of Hospitals 
No 6 General Hospital has arrived and is to be fixed at 
Nauuwport Four Canadian nursing sisters have been posted 
to Wynberg 
It has been arranged that Lord Iveaghs hospital will be 
at Beaufort West This Karoo town is extremely well 
situated but is a perfect hotbed of typhoid However once 
on the Karoo Matjesfontein and Beaufort West are practi 
cally the only places available and for hospitals now being 
established it is perhaps as well to go inland as well because 
of the movingforward of the troops as because of the con 
tinuous rains with which Capetown will shortly be visited 
practically daily The Yeomanry Hospital is I understand 
to be fixed inland after all and it is quite possible that one 
if not two of the general hospitals may make an upcountry 
move 
Phthisis after Lobar Pneumonia 
Owing to the approaching change of seasons it is becoming 
a question what should be done with the phthisical cases 
which are accumulating Apart from ordinary cases of the 
disease there is a notable tendency which it is a little 
difficult to explain for quite a number of men who had had 
lobar pneumonia to develop a rapidlyadvancing form of 
phthisis directly as a sequel of the former affection Dr 
DarleyHartley who has charge of the medical wards in the 
right wing of the station hospital emphasises this tendency y 
and has verified his diagnosis early by bacteriological investi 
gation Hitherto it has not been considered advisable to send 
those patients home to an English winter while none of the 
base hospitalsthe station hospital least of all on account Of 
its dusty and windy situationare suitable for openair 
treatment more especially as these cases are mostly of a rapid 
md high febrile type Should any of the general hospitals 
De moved upcountry the cases could be advantageously 
iealt with there or if not they will probably be sent to 
Setley which after another month or two will be a better 
limate than the Cape Peninsula 
The General and Portland Hospitals at Rondebosch 
 
No 3 General Hospital and the Portland Hospital are pitched 
n adjoining sites at Rondebosch about a mile from the 
itation on shallow sandy ground with a clay subsoil amidst 


Maroh 17

66 
pine woods The sand is so shallowin parts of the camp 
not more than 3 or 4 inches deepthat one would have had 
some prima facie fears about drainage especially as the slope 
is very slight However Colonel Wood in command of 
No 3 has arranged so excellent a system of drainage and 
sanitation as to overcome all the difficulties and both hos 
pitals are in a hygienic respect wellnigh perfect There are 
two or three points in the administration of No 3 which are 
somewhat original albeit deserving of the highest praise 
Besides the ordinary sanitary supervision of the Principal 
Medical Officer who makes a regular round of the whole 
extensive area every morning and the usual inspections of 
the orderly medical officer one of the staff Captain Withers 
is sanitary officer in addition to his other duties and has 
three men under him doing nothing but sanitary work Con 
sequently the most constant personal attention to every 
sanitary detail is given The enteric stools are of course 
dealt with in a special structure adjacent to the enteric 
wards and after being disinfected in the ordinary way are 
mixed with a large quantity of sawdust and this is again 
saturated with paraffin and the whole removed to a site on 
the outskirts of the camp and burned This addition of 
paraffin struck me as a remarkable instance of the thorough 
ness with which Colonel Wood carries out every detail 
His favourite disinfectant appears to be formalin 
Dressings are burned in three very handy little in 
cinerators Soiled linen from infectious cases is first of 
all soaked in formalin solution and then dealt with in 
the Theal disinfector if that apparatus which has to 
do duty for all the hospitals is available If not pro 
longed boiling in large cauldrons is resorted to One may 
point out that the soakage pit system of dealing with liquid 
refuse so effective at Wynberg is out of the question on a site 
like Rondebosch where drainage clean away has to be resorted 
to Another point is worth mention For the enteric cases 
hospital marquees are not used but three of the larger store 
marquees This strikes me as being a decided advantage 
They are larger containing fifteen beds each arranged in a 
row down each side and could contain sixteen but for one 
bed space being occupied by a table They have a more airy 
and cheerful appearance owing to the greater width and the 
larger number accommodated facilitates nursing arrange 
ments Of course they are only single tents but this in so 
airy a situation and at this season of the year does not inter 
fere with either drainage or ventilation Attached to the 
enteric wards is a spare marquee used by the sisters as a sort 
of office and ward annexe in which Colonel Wood insists that 
all spare blankets and clothing fruit and other articles of 
diet and so on shall be kept I consider this arrangement a 
most admirable one The other marquees have a maximum 
of seven patients the serious surgical marquees only four 
and most of the major operations are isolated for a few days 
Another little convenience not to be found in every London 
hospital is a preparation tent adjoining the operating 
marquee in which timid patients can be anaesthetised 
The Portland Hospital 
Among the cases in the Portland Hospital is one by far the 
most remarkable I have yet seen It was shown to me by Mr 
Bowlby and I enclose a photograph taken by Mr Wallace 
which he very kindly placed at my disposal An expanding bullet 
entered the anterior edge of the tibia making the ordinary 
small wound It completely smashed the bone destroying its 
continuity for fully two inches and emerging by a huge circu 
lar wound about three inches in diameter so large that one 
part of its circumference is within about f of an inch of the 
edge of the entrance wound Mr Bowlby found that not only 
was there most extensive comminution at the seat of injury 
but that the lower fragment of the tibia was split longitudina 
ally downwards as far as it could be followed All the frag 
ments having been removed the two parts of the lower longi 
tudinal split were wired togther and then the lower fragment 
was wired as a whole to the upper By this I do not mean 
that they were approximated for that was found to be im 
possible but they were fixed Mr Bowlby says that some 
new bone was certainly growing and the wound is now rapidly 
granulating up The same patient was hit by a similar bullet 
also just above the elbow which however missed the humrus 
and then smashed the upper part of the radius and ulna This 
wound also is doing excellently It was put up straight at 
first and is now on an angular splint The movement of the 
elbow joint is apparently all right and the constitutional dis 
turbance all through has been practically nil The same Boer 
inflicted both wounds deliberately emptying his rifle into the 
soldier 
Portland Hospital Wound exit of leg by expanding bullet 
Another case illustrates the comparatively little harm done 
by the Mauser A bullet had entered just behind the internal 
malleolus drilled through the astragalus and emerged about 
the centre of the external malleolus Nothing was ever ap 
plied but the original field dressing and the wound has healed 
perfectly 
In another case the bullet had entered in the left buttock 
had passed through the pelvis and emerged just below the 
great trochanter on the right side There were no signs of any 
bladder trouble or other intraabdominal injury which is the 
more remarkable as the exit wound is rugged with everted 
edges and quite  inch in diameter showing that the bullet 
used was something softer than the Mauser It is nearly 
healed 
The fittings at the Portland Hospital are superb although 
everything is arranged for easy transport The dispensary 
fittings both here and in No 3 are entirely made out of the 
original packing cases These are banked in various ways to 
serve as counters tables and cupboards and each box has its 
lids sewed by hinges on one side to form a falldown door 
On moving nothing is required but to pack the boxes and 
fasten them down The operating tables take to pieces 
and pack up but they are more substantial than the army 
regulation table which has been found to collapse on occa 
sion The use of tortoise tents increases the mobility of the 
hospital as these tents only weigh 3oolbs as against the soolbs 
of the army marquees Those in use at the Portland except 
two greenXare the ordinary white The Australian tortoise 
tents are green Of course No 3 Hospital has the regulation 
marquee The military officers seem to think that the tortoise 
tent is better than the marquee It seems to me however 
hardly to stand the wind so well and the flappingin a breeze 
is certainly more obvious Mr Bowlby and Mr Wallace are 
certainly keeping up to theirreputation as surgeons and are 
doing some brilliant work 
No 3 General Hospital 
At No 3 also some very fine surgery has been done 
It has not however been of such a strictly military charac 
ter as at the Portland One development surprised me as 
being somewhat unusual in a general hospital but all the 
same strong evidence of the uptodate methods of the men 
at No 3 Colonel Wood the PMO who by no means con 
fines himself to administrative matters has done three sue 
cessful to date operations for radical cure of hernia  and 
Civil Surgeon Robinson one all by Bassinis metLo

Another strikingly difficult operation has been done by 
Major Keogh and Captain WadeBrown and had been en 
tirely successful the man being practically well yesterday 
The patient had been wounded by an expanding bullet passing into the calf from the front but just missing the tibia The 
wound completely healed then some days later a very 
large swelling suddenly appeared and a traumatic aneurysm 
was diagnosed the diagnosis proving correct  when the swel 
ling was cut down upon immense clots were turned out 
Mr Bowlby was good enough to see the case and advised 
plugging This course was adopted and the case did well for 
two days when haemorrhage recommenced Major Keogh and 
Captain WadeBrown cut down through a very welldeveloped 
gastrocnemius and after much difficulty succeeded in tying the 
posterior tibial artery above and below no mean surgical achiev 
ment Major Keogh combines the offices of registrar and 
officer in charge of the surgical division and does most of the 
rray work into the bargain Colonel Wood himself helping a 
good deal in the latter They have sueceeded admirably in 
localisation some very deep fragments of shell having been 
fixed to a nicety as proved by probe measurements when cut 
down upon 
A couple of Wheelhouse operations have been done for 
stricture and one attempted but abandoned in favour of the 
oldfashioned Cocks operation This last was a man who 
complained of nothing but incontinence of urine Careful 
examination showed that he had a perineal fistula which he 
was concealing in his anxiety to get to the front There was 
extensive extravasation and he died very shortly after the 
operation had been performed He had a huge prostatic 
abscess a bladder about as bad as it could be and pyelitis in 
both kidneys And this man still tried to get away to fight 
for his country  Verily we have some heroes amongst us 
still 
At present the Portland has about 90 beds occupied and the 
No 3 something over 300 Careful observation of the two 
institutions side by side is instructive as showing that even 
when in close comparison with the work of two of the most 
brilliant London surgeons the army men can still hold their 
own in an honourable rivalry Colonel Woods work shows 
that a RAMC officer does not necessarily rust when he 
grows grey in the service 
THE BATTLE OF SPION KOP 
From an Occasional Correspondent 
The Conditions op the Battle 
On January 15th the cavalry under Lord Dundonald by a 
brilliant forced march seized the passage of the Tugela at 
Potgieters Drift and at the same time reported that the pas 
sage of the river at Triegarts Drift some ve miles further 
up the river was unoccupied by the Boers The force under 
Sir Redvers Buller which was then encamped at Springfield 
paraded at 530 pm on January 16th and made a forced 
night march of sixteen miles through a wild rugged barren 
and mountainous district to Emmasdale a high plateau 
which 
commanded the river at Triegarts Drift Arriving there at 
245 am on January 17th the troops bivouacked until day 
break when breakfasts were served Immediately afterwards 
two batteries of field artillery were pushed forward to the edge 
of the plateau so as to command the crossing and a company 
of Royal Engineers supported by cavalry and infantry 
were sent to throw a couple of pontoon bridges across the 
river 
These were completed about 4 pm and our advanced troops 
crossed at once The remainder of the troops bivouacked on 
the south side of the river for the night The whole of the 
following day was spent in getting the troops together with 
the transport field hospitals and bearer companies across the 
pontoon bridges At 4 am on January 19th the troops were 
hurried out of camp in the direction of Venters Spruit and 
were practically kept under arms all day in a broiling sun as 
an attack by the Boers was believed to be imminent The 
attack did not take place however and after sunset we 
bivouacked at Venters Spruit At daybreak on January 20th 
the troops advanced to attack the Boer position which was 
situated amongst the steep hills of the Spion Kop range 
The position was indeed a formidable one composed as it was 
of masses of steep and rugged hills which extended from 
north to south for nearly three miles Many of these were 
very steep and varied in height from 500 feet to 2000 feet 
above the plain Before reaching these the troops had to 
cross an open plain which sloped upwards to the hills at an 
angle of 20 to 25 degrees 
The Field Hospitals 
During the six days of the battle our losses were roughly 
250 killed and between 800 and 900 wounded To meet this 
great emergency the medical arrangements were carefully 
planned by the PMO Colonel T J GallweyCB RAMC 
No 4 Stationary Hospital under Major R Kirkpatrick 
RAMC was moved up to Spearmans Hill the accommoda 
tion being raised to 500 beds whilst a bearer company and 
field hospital accompanied each brigade The Fifth or Irish 
Brigade under General Fitzroy Hart CB was the first to 
attack their object being to turn the Boer right flank at 
Rangworthy The Fifth Brigade Field Hospital under Major 
G H Younge RAMCwhich distinguished itself at the 
battle of Colensowas pushed forwards to Seymours Farm a 
large dwellinghouse with numerous outbuildings situated on 
the lower range of hills at Rangworthy The houses were 
cleared out and occupied as a hospital tents being also pitched 
on a large grasscovered square in rear of the dwellinghouse 
Being in the most advanced position a very large share of 
the work fell to this hospital No fewer than 21 officers and 
326 men were admitted for wounds received in action As may 
be imagined under the circumstances the hospital establish 
ment was kept working practically day and night The other 
hospitals however especially that under Major J D Moir 
RAMC were far from idle The arrangements made by 
Colonel T J Gallwey and carried out by LieutenantColonel 
W B Allin PMO of the Second Division for evacuating 
the wounded were so admirable that the congestion of the 
field hospitals was rapidly overcome 
The Stationary Hospitals 
Convoys of wounded were sent back in wagons and ambu 
lances to Triegerts Drift There they were met by fresh 
ambulances and Indian dhoolie bearers from Spearmans Hill 
who conveyed them across the river to the Stationary Hospital 
To show the excellence of the arrangements I may mention 
that the order to fall back was received at the 5th Brigades 
Field Hospital about 8 am on January 25th At 11 am the 
hospital marched out of Seymours Farm having in the mean 
time struck their tents packed their equipment and des 
patched all their wounded to Spearmans Hill Looked at as 
a whole no praise is too high for the manner in which the 
medical arrangements and treatment of the wounded was 
carried out during and after the battle As may be imagined 
the collection of the wounded from amongst the steep rugged 
hills which formed the Boer position where the use of ambu 
lances was out of the question and each wounded man had to 
be carried on a stretcher was no light task Yet the wounded 
were collected and brought to the field hospitals with very 
little delay Amongst the officers of the bearer companies 
Captain E M Morphew RAMC was conspicuous for his 
untiring labour his indifference to danger and his ready 
resource amidst every difficulty He scarcely left the field 
during the battle and the absence of rest and food seemed 
not to affect him 
The medical department may well look back on the manner 
in which they acquitted themselves at the battle of Spion Kop 
with feelings of justifiable pride and the way in which the 
evacuation of the wounded was carried out when the retire 
ment was ordered was referred to by the General Officer Com 
manding as truly wonderful

Ladysmith and Kimberley 
Additional evidence if such were needed continues to reach 
us from time to time of the great sufferings endured by the 
garrison at Ladysmith and the heavy mortality both in that 
town and in Kimberley during the last weeks of the state of 
siege The state of things was bad in December but was 
much worse in January and as February advanced disease

worked ravages and short inferior rations bad water foul 
smells and fierce heat all played their part in spreading 
typhoid and dysentery Medicines were exhausted and the 
nurses were worked almost to death while the plague of flies 
made life almost intolerable The calculations by Dr James 
Dunlop published below show how slight was the sustenance 
offered by the rations in the later days of the siege A 
Reuters telegram states that the mortality returns for Feb 
ruary show that the deathrate per 1000 was Whites 428

races 5837 Enteric fever was responsible for the death of 6 
whites excluding cases contracted elsewhere and 9 coloured 
people The deaths from scurvy among the coloured popula 
tion amounted to 250 There are still 750 cases in the

British Prisoners in Pretoria 
Laffans Pretoria correspondent in a despatch dated 
January 24th states that the Boer Government has endea 
voured to maintain what it considers a correct attitude in 
its occasional communication with the British Government 
and its representatives Whenever British prisoners have 
arrived at Pretoria careful lists have been made of names 
rank and condition and telegraphed to Sir Alfred Milner 
This service has been scrupulously reciprocated by the High 
Commissioner at Cape Town It is stated to be the inten 
tion of the Boer authorities in case the supplies run short 
to expel all foreigneis from the country and to put the 
British prisoners upon a diet of mealies The correspondent 
states that he has just returned from a visit to the Water 
Fall the new military prison camp occupied by about 2600 
soldiers The impression he gathered from this visit was 
that the prisoners were being well fed  they were allowed to 
purchase vegetables and fruit The hospital arrangements 
he described as excellent and the Government was sending a 
daily supply of fountain water in tanks from Pretoria The 
State Model School in which the officers in Pretoria are con 
fined is modern and wellbuilt having many large and lofty 
rooms and surrounded by a broad cool verandah In painful 
contrast to the treatment of the British regulars however it 
would appear that the treatment of the Colonials of Natal or 
Cape Colony is harsh Thus even Laffans correspondent 
who is an American journalist and by no means illdisposed 
towards the Boers says that 
 
prisoners of this class when 
ever identified are separated from the others and sent to 
the ordinary gaol where they are treated like common 
criminals 
This testimony is confirmed by the special correspondent of 
the Daily Mail writing from Pretoria gaol on March 2nd He 
states In the gaol are about one hundred Colonials who 
were taken on the Natal frontier and at Kuruman  they are 
undergoing scandalous treatment exactly as if they were 
criminals without hard labour  they have no coffee or tea 
are locked in cells at 6 in the evening are not allowed to see 
friends or relations and are searched like felons The treat 
ment described by these correspondents as meted out to the 
Colonials was experienced by myself as a political prisoner 
with the Boers in 1895 The beggarly starvation rations here 
mentioned were for a time served out to the reform prisoners 
with the result that sickness among several of their number 
rapidly supervened and strong representations from both 
outside and within the prison compelled the Government to 
amend this diet scale and thus save them from the reproach 
of doing men to death while nominally subjecting them to 
prison treatment What justification can possibly be put for 
ward by the Boer Government for this treatment of South 
African colonists  It is an infringement of international prac 
tice and the usages of civilised belligerents 
Mafeking 
Kimberley and Ladysmith being relieved or anxieties are 
now centred chiefly upon the gallant little garrison under 
Colonel BadenPowell still holding the little town of 
Mafeking The reports that come through are sufficiently 
explicit to enable us to realise the gravity of their position 
Thus Reuters agent on February 19th says that dysentery 
and stomach evils through the want of vegetables and good 
I food are rife amongst the garrison Since the beginning of 
I the siege 292 persons have been killed or wounded or have 
I died of disease It is devoutly to be hoped that the statement 
that Colonel Plumer is sufficiently near to have got a waggon 
load of provisions into the town may turn out to be true but 
it is to be feared that in any case the deathrate must have 
been enormous during the last few weeks 
British Wounded at Burghersdorp 
An interesting letter from an officer of the R AMC who 
was at Burghersdorp with the British wounded and prisoners 
after the Stormberg reverse has been published The 
letter dated Sterkstroom January 24th but was not allowed 
to be published until our forces had reoccupied Burghersdorp 
From this letter it appears that the Englishmen in the town 
banded themselves together refusing either to take 
the oath of allegiance lo the Free State or leave 
and did everything in their power for the British 
prisoners who were taken through from Gatacres 
column to Pretoria as well as for the wounded As 
many as 44 wounded were in the hospitals at one time and 
the whole of the provision and the nursing of this force was 
undertaken by this small band of English men and women  
books were supplied from the town library and the Committee 
were unwearying in their efforts for the relief of the wounded 
The stubborn refusal either to submit or fly and the gallant 
efforts under the most trying and adverse circumstances 
made by this little band of loyalists in Burghersdorp deserves 
cordial recognition and permanent record in the history of 
the campaign 
Abuse of the White Flag  Expanding Bullets 
Lord Robertas last despatch to the State Presidents of the 
two Republics refening to Boer misuse of the white flag puts 
the seal of the highest authority upon charges which have 
on many previous occasions been brought against the Boers 
A large quantity of expanding bullets of three different kinds 
are said by Lord Roberts to have been found in Cronjes 
laager and after other engagements with the Boer forces 
As Lord Roberts says Such breaches of the recognised 
usages of war and of the Geneva Convention are a disgrace to 
any civilised Power Mr Trves is reported to have stated 
to Reuters correspondent at Durban that a considerable pro 
portion of the wounds received by our men in the recent 
fighting at Hlangwane and Pieters were caused by softnosed 
bullets

THE FOOD RATIONS IN LADYSMITH 
Wb are indebted to Dr James C Dunlop of Edinburgh for 
the following interesting note on the food rations given to the 
soldiers and other inhabitants of Ladysmith during the latter 
part of the siege  
It occurred to me that it might be of interest to formulate 
what the dietetic value of the rations were and thus obtain 
some measure of one of the hardships undergone by the resi 
dents in that town My estimation may be considered 
approximate only exactitude in the matter being unobtain 
able The particulars of the rations I have taken from a 
despatch from the Daily Telegraphs special correspondent 
dated Ladysmith March ist and the composition of the 
food stuffs I have estimated from the tables given in 
Atwater and Bryants Composition of American Food Materials 
United States Department of Agriculture Office of Experi 
mental Stations Bulletin 28 revised 1859 In the following 
two tables are shown the approximate food value of daily 
rations and the comparison of that to the standards and 
to some official dietaries

The comparison shown in the second table tells a sad tale 
of serious underfeeding or in other words of partial starva 
tion It may be noted that the food value of the Ladysmith 
rations only amounts to half what the older authorities put 
down as the normal diet see Voits standard and to only 
about 40 per cent of the more modern standard Atwaters 
The comparison between Ladysmith rations with prison and 
poorhouse diets shows them to be of far less food value than 
the food of a prisoner and of even less food value than the 
food of our underfed paupers 
These figures and comparisons give some conception of one 
of the hardships of a siege and if when considering them 
one remembers that this deplorably short feeding was com 
bined with fairly hard work one can only express surprise at 
our gallant soldiers being able to continue such a struggle 
and great admiration of their success in so doing 
CASUALTIES AMONG OFFICERS KAMC 
Lieutenant HUGH BERNARD ONRAET 
Lieutenant Onrat who was killed on February 27th during the fighting which preceded the relief of Ladysmith was the 
Medical Oflcer of the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers He 
was the eon of Mr Pierre Onrat an indigo planter at 
Bhagalpur Bengal where Lieutenant Onrat was born 
While yet a child be lost his father and about 1879 his 
mother settled at Sydenham He received his early educa 
tion at Cranleigh Surrey and subsequently became a 
student at Guys Hospital We are indebted to Mr Charters 
Symonds for the following note on his career there  
 
As one of poor Bernard Onrats teachers at Guys Hospital 
your readers may like to know what we thought of him He was 
one of the most genial and pleasant of 
 
boys and his happy and bright disposition endeared him to all Though less 
gifted than many as regards ability he yet possessed those 
qualities that drew from his teachers a special regard By 
patient and earnest attention to his duties he proved him 
self a reliable worker and one left him in charge of import 
ant cases feeling sure that nothing would be overlooked His 
delightfully cheerful disposition his keen interest in sport and his attachment to military life marked him as eminently 
suited for the medical service of the army When we 
nominated two men for the service last year his name was 
placed third We all wished to nominate him but the 
unexpected application from a senior man compelled us to 
act otherwise When I saw that he was sent to the front I 
knew that in Bernard Onrat they had a man who would 
never fail to discharge his duty in the face of the greatest 
dangers and would preserve a cool judgment in the most 
trying circumstances His cheerful disposition would enable 
many a poor fellow to bear his sufferings with greater forti 
tude and last of all that he knew how to do his special 
work and would do it well That he met his death in the 
discharge of his duties that in doing so he scorned the 
dangers of the fightiDg line none who knew Bernard Onrat 
will doubt A career of much promise and a man of a lovable 
disposition has been cut off 
Mr Onrat obtained the diplomas of the Conjoint Board in 
London in 1898 and entered the Royal Army Medical Corps 
in July 1899  
Lord Roberts in his telegraphic despatch from Driefontein 
dated March 1 ith states that during the previous day when 
the brunt of the fighting fell on KellyKennys division the 
Sixth two officers of the RAMC were wounded Major 
T Du B Whaite originally attached to the Third Field Hos 
pital of the Divisional Troops of the Sixth Division was 
severely wounded in the chest Major Whaite entered the 
service in July 1886 and was promoted to the rank of Major 
in July 1898 The other officer who is returned as slightly 
wounded in the neck is Lieutenant J G Berne who was 
Medical Officer of the Royal Field Artillery attached to the 
Sixth Division 
During an engagement at Britstown with the rebels in the 
Western part of the field of operations an engagement in 
which the City of London Volunteers were in action Civil 
Surgeon H Moore was slightly wounded in the left foot 
To the list of deaths from enteric fever at Ladysmith must 
be added the name of Lieutenant G W Grey Jones RAMC 
who died on February 20th He was a student of St 
Marys Hospital and qualified MRCS and LRCP early 
in 1898 For a few months he was House Surgeon at the 
Horton Infirmary Banbury and entered the Service on October 
ist 1898 After passing the usual probationary period at 
Netley he received his commission as Lieutenant RAMC 
from January ist 1899 and on September 30th he embarked 
with No 12 Field Hospital on board the ss Kinfauns Castle 
for South Africa and immediately on arrival at Durban was 
urgently sent up to Ladysmith and was on the field a few 
days before the investment of that town by the Boer army

YEOMANRY FIELD HOSPITAL AND BEARER 
COMPANY 
The staff of the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer 
Company 143 strong were inspected at Devonshire House on 
March 12th The staff was under the command of Major C 
Stonham Chief Surgeon and Military Commandant of the 
Hospital and Major G E Hale R AMC DSO who is in 
command of the Bearer Company The DirectorGeneral of 
the Army Medical Department first made an inspection Soon 
afterwards the Prince of Wales who was accompanied by the 
Princess arrived and inspected the detachment After 
shaking hands with the officers he addressed the 
men as follows   
I am glad to have had the opportunity o 
inspecting you before your departure and am sure that yon 
will carry out well the duties which will devolve upon you 
You are leaving this country becauee you wish to do some 
thing to assist those who are fighting for the honour of the 
flag Three cheers were given for the Prince and were re 
peated for the Princess The Royal party then returned to the 
terrace and the men passed in single file before the Princess 
who gave each man a parcel containing articles of clothing 
The staff left Liverpool Street Station for the Albert Docks 
on March 13th when they had an enthusiastic sendoff from 
the students of the Westminster Hospital of which Major 
Charles Stonham is the Senior Surgeon and of the London 
Hospital to which Captain T H Openshaw FRCS is 
Assistant Surgeon The staff sailed in the Winkfield the same

CaseDr F H Marson showed a boy aged 10 years the 
subject of partial paralysis of left arm and leg and frequent 
epileptic fits 
The hemiplegia resulted from a fall on the head from a height of 25 feet 
when the boy was i year old The fits commenced eight months ago 
at first one increasing to four daily and simulating epilepsy but always 
commencing with a cramp of the left leg Dr Marson trephined over a 
cranial depression about  inch anterior to the motor area for the left leg 
On removing the bone about 3 drachms of fluid escaped and a cyst was 
found about the size of an acorn between the skull and dura mater After 
the operation the fits were much milder being more of the nature of hys 
terical attacks  they appeared to depend only on the accumulation of 
fluid in the wound and occurred at intervals of from three to six days 
The last fit occurred five weeks after the operation and that was five weeks 
ago The boy had been skating sinceand the use was returning in his arm 
and leg
