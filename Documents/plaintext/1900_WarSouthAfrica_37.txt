THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
A FIRST FIELD DRESSING 
By G Lenthal Cheatle FRCS 
Late Consulting Surgeon to HM Forces in South Africa and Assistant 
Surgeon to Kings College Hospital 
Whenever I saw wounds not of recent infliction the following 
description explains the usual relationship that existed 
between them and infective or noninfective processes  
i The small wound caused by a Mauser or LeeMetford 
bullet covered by a scab of dry blood clot under which 
healing had practically taken place 
2 A small moist ulcer from which there was a slight sero 
purulent discharge which contained cocci and obviously 
infected This wound represented a septic condition of i The 
sepsis remaining superficial and not extending to deeper 
parts 
3 A small moist infected ulcer communicating with the 
deep parts which were also septic and from which pus could be 
squeezed 
4 The superficial wound was healed but the deep parts 
were infected as was seen to be the case in some chest or 
abdominal wounds 
In some of the above cases the wounds of entrance or of exit 
might be represented by the dry scab and the other by one of 
the effects of infection just described 
5 All the larger wounds that is to say those caused by shell 
or expanding bullets were almost without exception infected 
either superficially and deeply or only superficially 
I cannot give the exact proportion between infected and 
noninfected cases but my own experience is that the cases 
which were quite free from infection were in the minority 
perhaps a large minority The average of cases free from in 
fection was lowered by those from Jacobsdal Paardeberg and 
Osfontein but even without them the statement holds good 
It is a well known fact that all wounds in military or civil 
surgery become infected at the time of their infliction or 
within a few hours afterwards This is therefore the most 
critical time of a wound from the point of view of asepsis 
Hence one concluded that it might be possible to add some 
precautionary measure to the already valuable first field dress 
ing which is stitched into the jacket of every soldiers uniform 
in which he fights Without entering into details this first 
field dressing consists of antiseptic gauze and wool together 
with a strip of bandage the whole being contained in a little 
bag of mackintosh or parchment This dressing is often 
placed upon the wounds by the patient himself by his nearest 
neighbour officer or private or by a medical officer By 
whomever it is applied under the exigencies of circumstances 
it is almost invariably put on in the absence of a purifying 
lotion and hence apart from what the bullet or portion of shell 
takes into the wound the patients skin fingers and clothes or 
the fingers of his dresser are the chief sources from which in 
fection is derived 
It is quite evident that a first field dressing cannot include 
all the paraphernalia we deem necessary to establish asepsis in 
hospital practice but at the same time I venture to hope that something might be included with very little additional 
complication that could inhibit bacterial growth and which 
could also exert some germicidal action 
After trying iodoform made into a paste with a 1 in 20 
watery solution of carbolic acidwhich however proved 
unsatisfactoryI used the double cyanide of zinc and 
mercury salt in the form of powder with which Lord Lister 
had kindly supplied me on leaving this country I found 
however that when applying it to a wound in the open air 
the wind blew more of it over myself than over the area for 
which it was intended Besides this any powder is difficult 
to apply to the posterior aspects of the trunk and limbs 
without greatly disturbing a patient by rolling him over on 
his face 
Then I employed this same double cyanide of zinc and 
mercury powder made into a paste with a 1 in 20 watery 
solution of carbolic acid This paste had the advantage of 
the germicidal action of the carbolic acid added to the great 
inhibitory power exerted over bacterial growth by the double 
salt It could be applied anywhere and in any wind and 
further in spite of using it in large quantities and in large 
wounds I have not seen any poisonous effects nor any sign 
of local irritation In fact this paste proved most satis 
factory In using it I rubbed some over my fingers over the 
skin around the wound and upon the wound itself before 
putting on the first field dressing It was of course difficult 
to carefully observe cases that were being left behind or sent 
away by convoy but every now and then I was able to see 
them again and they were ail doing well the wounds being 
all represented by a dry scab in which by careful inspection 
the double salt could be seen 
Since I have returned home I have worked out theamount 
that would be necessary for each field dressing and the 
method by which it can be carried A tin collapsible tube 
the same as artists use for their oils is the best carrier for 
the paste which does not chemically act upon the tin By 
applying vaseline to the possible outlets for evaporation the 
paste will remain as such for years even in hot climates 
The best proportion of the double cyanide of zinc and 
mercury powder to the carbolic acid solution has been worked 
out by Mr William Martindale and myself and is as follows  
Mercury and zinc cyanide 400 grs  tragacanth in powder 
1 gr  carbolic acid 40 grs  sterilised water 800 grs Mix 
and fill 12 collapsible tin tubes 
The tragacanth helps to keep the powder in suspension 
The addition of glycerine is not to be recommended as it 
might interfere with the rapidity with which the wounds 
become scabbed over The tube and paste weigh no grains 
Its presence does not appreciably increase the dressing by 
weight or bulk 
In my opinion this paste proves an invaluable addition to a 
first field dressing and its value cannot be overestimated in 
in those instances where water cannot be found to make the 
necessary lotions in the field hospitals 
All that is required in the way of direction for its use is that 
the dresser should squeeze out some of the paste upon his 
own fingers before applying it around and on the wound and 
after this apply the outer dressings and bandage 
It may be said that these precautions are too intricate for 
the surgical instincts of the ordinary soldier but if he is care 
fully taught the use of the dressing I cannot see that this 
objection is insuperable 
To sum up  A first field dressing should consist of a col 
lapsible tube containing this paste double cyanide gauze and 
double cyanide wool each in sufficient quantity for two 
wounds and a bandage with four safety pins the whole being 
enclosed in a mackintosh bag 
NOTES ON DYSENTERY 
FROM THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL SOUTH AFRICA 
BY 
Owen Richards MA and J W Washbourn MD 
Fellow of New College Oxford Physician to Guys Hospital  
Physician to the London 
Fever Hospital  etc 
Up to the present date 250 cases of dysentery have been 
treated in this hospital Most of these cases were admitted 
some time after the beginning of the attack and by them 
selves are of little value in forming a clinical picture of the 
disease We have however notes of 20 cases which have 
been treated here from the commencement and the following 
description is based partly upon these cases and partly upon 
an analysis of the cases admitted at various stages of the 
disease For convenience of description we will divide our 
cases into four classes A B C and D 
Class A 
These cases are unattended by pyrexia the other symptoms 
are similar to those in Class Bthat is the passage of blood 
and slime Four of our 20 cases belonged to this class  they were 
readily amenable to treatment 3 of the patients recovering in 
3 5 and 6 days respectively while in the fourth case which 
was of longer duration the patient was twice discovered 
taking improper food In a fifth case which recovered in 5 
days there was pyrexia for one night only the temperature 
reaching 1014o 
Class B 
Of our 20 cases 14 belonged to this class which is character

i8ed by a fairly definite pyrexial stage reminding one of the 
course of a specific fever The pyrexia which is irregular in 
type reaching ioito 1030 with morning remissions starts at 
the commencement of the attack and lasts about 6 daysin 
the 14 cases 4 3 6 4 6 4 5 8 8 6 8 5 6 8 days respect 
ively The onset is frequently preceded by ordinary diar 
rhoea lasting a day or two The principal symptoms of the 
attack are tenesmus with repeated calls to stool and the 
replacement of the normal faecal evacuations by blood and 
lime In favourable cases as the temperature falls the 
evacuations gradually assume a more faecal character and an 
ordinary diarrhoea persists for a day or two longer the whole 
attack lasting about 9 days 
Chart I shows the course of the temperature and the number of evacua 
tions in a typical case of this class ending in recovery The patient 
Private S a previously healthy man was under the care of Dr Breeks 
and was treated with magnesium sulphate

Of these 14 cases in 5 who were convalescing from disease other than 
nteric the course of the attack corresponded very closely with the above 
case In two others who were convalescent from enteric diarrhoea con 
tinued for 17 and 21 days In the ninth case Private A under the care of 
Dr Breeks the symptoms began in the usual way with pyrexia lasting 
for 7 days Shortly after the fall of the temperature the motions became 
fiecal The diarrhoea instead of subsiding continued for five weeks the 
bowels being open on an average nine times a day He became much 
emaciated and the abdomen was retracted Recovery ultimately ensued 
He was treated with ipecacuanha magnesium sulphate opium and bis 
muth This patient was convalescent from enteric fever at the time when 
lie was attacked which probably was the cause of the protracted course 
of the disease The remaining 5 cases in this class who were all con 
valescent from enteric fever ended fatally 
The attack began with the usual pyrexial stage In one case death 
occurred on the 7th day before the fall of temperature and in the others 
after the temperature had subsided on the nth 12th 13th and 14th days 
of the attack respectively 
This unfavourable course was we believe due to the lowered 
resistance consequent on the attack of enteric fever In two 
of the cases typhoid ulcers were found at the necropsy in 
another there was still evidence of enteric in the enlargement 
of the spleen and mesenteric glands and in the other two the 
patients were much enfeebled before the dysentery com 
menced The Charts II III IV and the following brief 
notes illustrate these cases 
Private T S under the care of Dr Richmond admitted on May 13th 
convalescent from enteric temperature having been normal for four 
days On May 19th he suffered from diarrhcea and on May 20th he 
began to pass blood and slime the temperature rising to 1014 In spite 
of treatment the dysenteric symptoms continued and the pulse gradu 
ally failed He died on May 26th At the postmortem examination dys 
enteric ulcration was found in the rectum sigmoid flexure and caecum 
together with small patches in the rest of the colon The lower end of 
the ileum was inflamed  the spleen and mesenteric glands were enlarged 
The patient was treated with ipecacuanha opium and astringents 
Private O  under care of Dr Handson Admitted on May 5th suffering 
from relapse of enteric The relapse was severe temperature varying 
between 103 and 104 It became normal on May 23rd and continued so 
until June 10th when it rose to 996o in the evening On this day the 
patient suffered from diarrhoea On the nth it reached 10320 in the 
evening diarrhcea continued The motions were at first fsecal and sub 
sequently consisted of nothing but blood and slime The temperature 
became normal on June 16th  the dysentery continued  hiccough de 
veloped and persisted during the last five days of life The patient died 
on the 23rd No postmortem examination was made This patient was 
treated with opium bismuth ipecacuanha and magnesium sulphate

Private P admitted May 24th under the care of Dr Handson Had 
been ill 24 days with enteric temperature having been normal for more 
than a week His temperature remained normal till May 29th On May 
oth 
his bowels were open twelve times and he passed blood and mucus 
n June 2nd the bowels were opened constantly with passage of blood 
and slime which continued till he died On June 3rd his pulse was very 
feeble On the 4th he suffered from great thirst and the abdomen be 
came retracted He rapidly emaciated and died on June nth At the 
fostmortem 
examination the whole of the large intestine and the lower 
wo feet of the ileum were acutely congested and thickened and there 
was severe dysenteric ulcration most marked in the rectum On the 
first day of the attack he was treated with ipecacuanha two doses 30 gr 
each followed by opium and bismuth  on the fourth day with magne 
sium sulphate  and on the fifth day ipecacuanha was again tried At 
various times morphine suppositories copper sulphate and different 
preparations of opium were administered 
i Complications 
In the case of Private A above quoted the diarrhoea 
instead of ceasing about the tenth day continued for five 
weeks and it is probable that many of the numerous cases 
admitted into the hospital some time after the commence 
ment of the attack were cases of this nature reaching us after 
the pyrexial stage had passed In some of these latter cases 
however the prolongation of the dysentery was due to a 
distinct relapse attended by the usual pyrexiafor example 
the case of Private J W below quoted In others it was due 
to a relapse unattended by pyrexia 
As regards other complications perforation of the intestine 
and consequent peritonitis has occurred in several cases and

Sal fo 
in one or two a temporary enlargement of the liver with 
pyrexia has occurred during convalescence In another case 
previously quoted in the British Medical Journal of June 
16th 1900 p 1455 the enlargement of the liver was followed 
by hemiplegia This was supposed to be due to a cerebral 
embolism 
As these cases were not seen from the commencement we 
are uncertain to which of our classes they belong In the 
following case however which from the nature of the relapse 
appeared to belong to Class B the enlargement of the liver 
was due to the formation of an abscess See Chart V 
Private J W admitted May th under the care of Dr Elliott He had 
had dysentery twice before during the last six months The present 
attack began on March 26th with passage of blood and slime at which 
time he stated that his temperature was raised on one occasion to xoi 
For ten days before admission the bowels had been normal On May 10th 
five days after admission he had a relapse of dysentery his temperature 
being raised to 1010 The temperature continued raised till May 19th by 
which time the dysentery had ceased The temperature then fell and 
remained nearly normal till May 31st when it rose to 1026o The liver 
subsequently became enlarged and pleurisy developed on the right side 
On June 8th Mr Raymond Johnson opened an abscess in the upper part 
of the right lobe of the liver This however did not relieve the patient 
who died on the same day At the postmortem examination extensive 
dysenteric ulcration was found in the large intestine and a second 
abscess was discovered in the lower part of the same lobe 
This is the only case of hepatic abscess which has been 
observed in this hospital 
Class C 
We have notes of only 3 cases of this class none of which 
were seen from the beginning From the accounts given by 
the patients the attacks began with the usual symptoms of 
dysentery namely the passage of blood and slime 
The patients had been ill 7 10 and 12 days before admis 
sion Subsequently to admission the symptoms were diar 
rhoea with motions of a brown colour accompanied by 
pyrexia and lasting for 24 25 and 19 days respectively In 
each case the course of the temperature and the character of 
the diarrhoea raised the suspicion of enteric In 2 of these 
cases this view was strengthened by the enlargement of the 
spleen None of the cases however gave a reaction with the 
typhoid bacillus in adilutionof 1 in 20 and the general condition 
of the patient and the appearance of the abdomen were not like 
those found in enteric  in fact in two of the cases the abdo 
men was distinctly retracted 
Chart VI and the following short notes illustrate this type  
QuartermasterSergeant L was admitted on May 13th under care of 
Dr Elliott He had been ill for a week with abdominal pain and strain 
ing and the passage of blood and slime The onset was marked by con 
tinued vomiting On admission the temperature was raised and pyrexia 
continued for over three weeks vide chart He suffered from diarrhoea 
the motions being of a brownish colour but neither blood nor slime were 
passed On May 22nd a sausageshaped swelling probably due to thicken 
ing of the intestine was to be felt in the situation of the sigmoid flexure 
and continued to be felt for a week On June 4th the temperature began 
to fall and on June 7th it was normal As the temperature fell the 
motions became formed and the patient became convalescent On 
June 7th his blood was tested and failed to give the Widal reaction in a 
dilution of x in 20 He was treated with opium bismuth ipecacuanha 
and salol 
Class D 
We have only seen one case of this class but as it was seen  
from the beginning of the attack and a postmortem examina 
tion was made it is especially instructive During life the 
case was considered to be one of enteric fever This diagnosis 
was supported by the fact that his blood gave the typhoid 
reaction 
He was in hospital for 19 days having suffered for a week 
previously from malaise The pyrexia was similar to that of 
a case of enteric fever  the bowels were at first constipated  
subsequently there was diarrhoea the motions were of a 
brown colour At no time was blood or slime observed in 
them He died of peritonitis caused by perforation of the 
large intestine and at the postmortem examination typical 
dysenteric lesions were found The following are brief notes 
with Chart VII of this case  
Orderly H admitted into hospital May 13th under care of Dr Fitzhugh 
and Dr Richmond Had been ill for a week with cold in the head aches

Chart VII 
At the postmortem examination which was performed by Dr Handson 
the peritoneum was covered with lymph there was a large quantity of 
liquid fsecai matter and purulent fluid in the peritoneal cavity Perfora 
tions were found in the sigmoid flexure descending and transverse colon 
The intestines were matted together The mesenteric glands of the small 
intestine were normal whilst those of the large intestine were slightly 
enlarged The large intestine was slightly thickened the mucous mem 
brane congested of a greenish black colour with numerous petechise There 
were a great number of minute punctate ulcers with sharplycut edges and 
several large ulcers from half to one inch in diameter with ragged edges and 
gangrenous bases About halfadozen of these large ulcers had perforated 
the perforations being circular and about an eighth of an inch in diameter 
The whole of the large intestine was more or less affected but the 
rectum sigmoid flexure and transverse colour had suffered more severely 
than the rest The mucous membrane of the small intestine was pale 
except the Peyers patches which were stained a purplish colour Except 
for this coloration there was no evidence that Peyers patches had been 
affected The liver was large soft and pale  the spleen was small 
Treatment 
From our experience here we have no doubt that both 
ipecacuanha and magnesium sulphate have a specific action 
The method adopted here for administering these drugs has 
been described by one of us already1 We believe ipecacuanha 
to be the most efficacious for we have seen cases which 
have resisted the action of magnesium sulphate cured by 
ipecacuanha Deemetinised ipecacuanha is not so valuable as 
the ordinary ipecacuanha and we do not recommend its use 
The diet is of the greatest importance As a rule it should 
be restricted to milk until the motions have become normal 
Meat appears to be especially harmful and it is a common 
experience to find diarrhoea recurring when a meat diet is 
commenced 
After the acute symptoms have subsided bismuth mor 
phine and astringents are of great value In some cases 
where there has been frequent tenesmus morphine supposi 
tories have apparently saved the patients life 
Pathology 
We have examined microscopically the excreta in numerous 
cases of dysentery and have never discovered amoebae The 
pus removed during life from the hepatic abscess above 
quoted contained no amoebae It contained however a large 
number of bacteria of which some were bacilli belonging to 
the coli group while others were streptococci 
Dr Handson has made postmortem examinations of 9 cases 
of dysentery dying in the hospital In 3 cases death was due 
to peritonitis from perforation in 1 case death was due to 
hepatic abscess  in 2 cases in addition to the dysenteric 
ulcration of the large intestine there was recent typhoid

ulcration in Peyers patches  in the remaining 3 the patients 
had recently suffered from enteric though there was no ulcra 
tion of Peyers patches obvious at the necropsy The lesions 
in the large intestine were such as are usually described in 
dysentery thickening of the wall with in all cases consider 
able ulcration In some cases the whole of the large intestine 
was affected In all cases the rectum was the part most 
severely ulcerated and next to that the caecum 
Remarks 
In the above description we have distinguished four clinical 
types of dysentery And the question arises whether these 
types are simply clinical varieties of the same disease or 
whether they are distinct diseases due to different causes 
The first type Class A appear to be simply mild forms 
without much constitutional disturbance The second type 
Class B seem to be a distinct clinical entity with a 
definite pyrexial stage like that of a specific fever In the 
cases which died the fatal event appear to have been due to 
the lowering of resistance caused by recent enteric Except 
for the result the clinical course was similar in the whole of 
the cases forming this class This view is supported by the 
fact that of the 9 nonfatal cases the 3 most severe occurred in 
patients convalescent from enteric 
The single case in Class D ran a very different course to that 
of Class B The symptoms were so similar to those of enteric 
fever that a mistake in the diagnosis was made The usual 
dysenteric symptomstenesmus and the passage of blood 
and mucuswere absent The patient had not been inoculated 
nor had he a previous attack of enteric His blood never 
theless gave the typhoid reaction Unfortunately the highest 
dilution used was 1 in 20 and we know that with diseases 
other than enteric the reaction is sometimes obtained with 
this low diluiion There was no evidence of enteric at the 
post mortem examination and the Peyers patches except for 
 slight discoloration appeared to be normal  the mesenteric 
glands and spleen were not enlarged As the patient belonged 
to our detachment we knew that there was no recent history 
ot enteric We have seen sporadic cases of ulcerative colitis 
in England running a precisely similar course 
The cases in Class C while under observation ran a some 
what similar course to the above case and indeed in all of 
them the question of enteric was raised The history of 
these cases however showed that they began with the usual 
dysenteric symptoms and viewed from a purely clinical 
standpoint thpy would appear to form a link between 
Classes C and D Without actual pathological evidence of 
the causation of dysentery it is impossible to assert whether 
these different clinical types belong to the sime disease 
Nevertheless we have thought that an attempt to dis 
tinguish between cliuical types may be of some assistance 
when the true pathology of this disease is mord thoroughly 
investigated  
A CASE OF ENTERIC FEVER ASSOCIATED WITH 
MALARIA 
By Major M T Yarr FRCSf RMC 
No 9 General Hospital Bloemfontein 
The following case should prove of iuterest more especially 
to students of tropical medicine So far as I knowI have no 
opportunity of consulting works of reference hereno case 
has previously been recorded of the discovery of the malarial 
plasmodium in the blood of a patient suffering from typhoid 
fever Dr Osier in the chapter on typhoid fever in his work 
on The Principles and Practice of Medicines chapter so 
exhaustive that it amounts to a monograph on the subject 
writes as follows page 33 1898 edition 
 
Malarial and 
typhoid fevers may be associated but a majority of the 
cases of socalled typhomalarial fever are either remittent 
malarial fever or true typhoid It is interesting to note that 
among my 685 cases of typhoid fever in not a single instance were 
the plasmodia found in the blood during the cow se of the dnease 
Many of our typhoid fever cases came from malarious regions 
Again page 39 he adds   
Typhoid fever and malarial fever 
in rare instances may coexist in the same patient Of 685 
cases of typhoid fever almost all with blood examinations 
and a majority of them coming from malarious regions in not 
a single instance were the malarial parasites found in the 
blood during the fever There is now no excuse whatever for 
the continued use by practitioners of the term 
 
typhoma 
arial 
 
fever and still less for the falsification of vital statistics 
by death certificates signed with this diagnosis The prin 
ciple is bad and the practice worse since it gives a false sense 
of security and may prevent proper measures of prophy 
laxis The italics are mine On the other hand Dr 
Manson Tropical Diseases page 109 remarks 
 
Well 
marked fluctuations of temperature and the appearance of 
the plasmodium in the blood in the course of a continued fever 
do not exclude typhoid These cases are typhomalarial and 
have to be treated as suchas tvphoid with a malarial com 
plication I have had many conversations with Dr Manson 
on malaria  in fact the knowledge I have of the subject is 
mainly due to his teaching and direction  but I have no 
recollection of his ever alluding to a specific instance of 
plasmodia in the blood of a typhoid patient Kelsch and

Kiener have described a modification of bilious remittent

nation is somewhat unfortunate as the disease called by this 
name is remittent fever associated with the socalled 
 
typhoid 
state and characterised by a low delirium brown tongue 
prostration etc  it is undoubtedly a convenient term but 
is wanting in scientific accuracy and liable to convey a false 
impression 
1 am bound to add that in the following case I was unfortu 
nately unable to employ Widals serum test and that I am 
well aware that it is occasionally difficult to diagnose typhoid 
from malarial fever The class of cases of malarial fever how 
ever which sometimes presents difficulties as regards dia 
gnosis belong to the category of Kelsch and Kieners   
typhoid remittents 
 
 at least such is my experience and 
do not present any points of resemblance to the compara 
tively mild case of typhoid fever which I am about to relate 
Lieutenant H aged 23 who arrived in South Africa from Burmah last 
February was admitted to this hospital from the Vaal River on June 7th 
suffering from enteric fever He was very thin and weak and stated he 
had been suffering from  diarrhoea and weakness 
 
for the previous ten 
days He had not been inoculated During the year in which he had 
been stationed in Burmah he had had three attacks of malarial fever 
which confined him to bed for periods varying from four to seven days 
A month after his arrival in Africain March lasthe had another 
attack but only stayed in bed one day In each instance the illness came 
on suddenly with a violent rigor followed by fever and profuse sweating 
His present illness began so insidiously that he could not fix the day of 
onset but thought that roughly speaking he had been  
seedy 
 
for at 
least ten days  he had had no shivering no sweating and was not awaie 
that he was leverish He said he just felt tired and annoyed by the 
persistent diarrhoea 
The disease ran the usual course of a mild attack of enteric fever vide 
chart on p 672  diarrhoea with claycoloured stools continued fever rose 
spots enlarged spleen brown fissured tonguesordesin fact all the charac 
teristic signsbeing present Within a week of admission the tempera 
ture began to fall ana on June 18theleven days after admission and 
probably about the twentyfirst day of the diseaseit had reached normal 
On June 15th I began examining the blood of enteric fever patients who 
had previously had malaria they were very few in number and prepared 
six slides two from him and one each from four others In five of the 
slides I could find nothing but in the sixth taken from Lieutenant Ht 
there were unmistakeable crescent bodies although very small numbers  
I could only find three in the whole slide This was three days before the 
temperature fell to normal On June 20th I again examined his blood 
this time finding only two crescents Early on tne morning of the 22nd 
he had slight shivering followed by heat and sweating  and again in the 
evening the temperature at 10 pm being ioo  next day his temperature 
was subnormal in the morning and normal in the evening Next day 
and the two following days it showed the fluctuations traced in the chart 
each rise being preceded by rigors and followed by very profuse sweat 
ing I suspected malaria and again examined the blood on June 27th 
when the temperature was subnormal morning and evening and was 
rewarded by finding numerous pigmented parasites of the kind figured 
by Marchiafava and Bignami as  
pigmented malignant quotidian ntra 
corpuscular pigmented parasites occupying from one to twothirds of the 
area of the corpuscles  there were also a few pigmented leucocytes 
Next day the parasites were much fewer but the number of pigmented 
leucocytes had increased Since then I have been unable to detect any 
thing abnormal in the blood with the exception of a few crescents on 
July 4th The patients temperature remained subnormal till July 7th 
when it became normal and has since remained so He is now July 
14th convalescent taking chicken and fish diet is allowed up half the 
day and is only waiting the arrival of a hospital train to be invalided to 
England His spleen continues enlarged and there is a certain amount 
of melan mia but all enteric symptoms have disappeared and he is 
gaining flesh and colour daily I did not give quinine until June 27th 
since which date he has taken 5 grs morning and evening After each 
sweating the temperature fell from one to three degrees  these falls are 
not shown on the chart as the nursing sister only took temperatures 
twice daily morning and evening The malarial fever appears to have 
been of a  double quotidian type as there were two distinct paroxysms 
daily on June 26th 28th and 29th 
THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
Mr A D Fripp writing from Deelfontein on July 30th 
says  From accounts of officers just down from Pretoria there 
seems to be very little enteric there or at Johannesburg and 
the opinion of those who know the climate and place is that 
there will not be any increase in that disease until the spring 
weather sets in at the end of September when they say we 
ought to anticipate an even heavier epidemic than the one 
which is just dying out unless ai we all hope the war has 
ceased and the bulk of the army has been got out of the 
country by that time Dr Washbourn has been con 
fined to his bed for a good many days but is about again now 
Mr Parker has been back at work some time and Mr 
Blathwayt has just returned after several weeks imprison 
ment in the scarlet fever camp but Dr Elliott and Mr 
Greenfield though quite convalescent have not yet recovered 
sufficient strength to return to work As mart epidemic 
of what has now become known as  
karrooitis has been 
going the round of the newcomers from England with just 
the same symptoms as were presented by those of our own 
staff who were attacked when we first came One at least of 
the many reputed causes of this complaint has disappeared 
since then namely the hot weather and if a similar process 
of exclusion can by comparing notes with other placesfor 
the disease has affected a very wide area be applied to some 
of the other theories we shall perhaps arrive at a true explana 
tion of its cause and then I hope we shall know how to 
prevent these distressing symptoms  at present we certainly 
do not know 
Writing again on August 6th Mr Fripp says  This is really 
little more now than a large convalescent camp It is extra 
ordinary what a tremendous change has come over the place 
since a fortnight ago when we were still very busy We have 
i had no deaths for two whole weeks and we have not taken in 
an ambulance trainload for three weeks Very nearly a 
hundred Yeomen have been admitted during the week but 
they arc almost without exception convalescents from other 
hospitals For instance all the wounded consisting of War 
wicks Gloucesters and Lancashires from the action nine 
weeks ago at Kheis have come on here from the Orange 
 
River Hospital Just over six hundred officers and men of the 
Yeomanry have been passed through the hospital since it was  
opened Of course a very large number of Yeomanry have  
been laid up in other hospitals it having been found impos 
sible from one cause and another to have them sent here 
Thus many in the acute stages of illness it would not be safe  
to move Others are laid up in parts of the Free State almost 
inaccessible to proper hospital transport  but the facilities of 
collecting in this hospital all those Yeomen who are in a lit 
condition to travel have been progressively increased daily 
and the arrangements to that end are now I believe as nearly 
perfect as the complicated conditions of the case permit 
There is for instance a standing order at De Aar which is 
the next station north of us and through which all patients 
going down country must pass ensuring that every train is 
warned to stop at Deelfontein and discharge any Yeomanry it 
may contain Also directly we hear there are any Yeomanry 
in a hospital upcountry we telegraph to the commandant of 
that hospital and ask him to send them to us as soon as they 
are fit to travel But if we are right in supposing that the 
number of Yeomanry in South Africa is about ten thousand 
we have already had through our hands not less than 6 pet 
cent of them a heavy proportion when you consider that none 
of that limb of the service have been out here for moro than 
ve months 
Out of this 600 already treated here there have only been 4  
deaths while out of the total number of admissions to the 
hospital of 2515 there have been in all 59 deaths a mortality 
of i per cent which is attributable almost entirely to 
enteric    
I was very glad indeed to see that Dr Oonan Doyle had 
been calling attention in the London press to the arduous and 
dangerous nature of the work doneand done cheerfully 
throughout this war by the hospital orderlies Among all the 
brave deeds and hard work done by the various branches of 
the army during the last ten months I do not believe that 
anybody of men in Her Majestys service has excelled even 
if it has equalled in bravery and pluck and continuous even  
monotonous laboriousness the behaviour of thousands of 
men who have been employed in the hospitals They have 
been called upon to do in addition to a full days work every 
day a full nights work every fourth or third or even at times 
of stress every second night Their work has gone on months 
after month quietly and unostentatiously without any of the 
glamour attaching to deeds which catch the public eye Many 
of them have died at their work but very few indeed have 
grumbled The service they have rendered to their country 
has indeed in the fullest sense of the word been splendids 
Several people have been asking what is co become of this 
hospital when the war is over We have not yet heard that 
any decision has been arrived at but as I told you many 
weeks ago my own hope is that it will betaken over as a going 
concern by the military authorities for the permanent use of 
the army of occupation or failing that by the civil 
authorities in which case it might be worked as a sanatorium

THE EXEMPTION OF HOSPITALS FROM RATING 
The Report of the rtelect Committee appointed to consider 
the operation of the law by which hospitals and other insti 
tutions for the care and treatment of the sick or of those 
afflicted in mind or body are liable to local rates has been 
issued with the proceedings of the Committee the minutes 
of evidence and appendices as a Bluebook1 
The Legal View 
It is pointed out that generally exemption was the rule until 
1865 when the House of Lords by a decision in the case of 
Jones and others v The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board 
held that properties producing no profit to the owners were 
under the Statute 43 Elizabeth c 2 rateable to the relief of 
the poor A decision relating to St Thomass Hospital estab 
lished that the principles upon which the Mersey Dock case 
had been decided applied to the hospital Hospitals and 
other charitable institutions thus became in point of law 
rateable to the poor Up to the time of the decision in the 
Mersey Dock case it had always been assumed that hospitals 
and other similar institutions were exempt 
Since the decision of the House of Lords although in many 
cases the rating authorities have acted with great considera 
tion going so far in some cases as to leave hospitals off the 
rating book entirely yet these institutions have been rated 
for the relief of the poor for school rates and also for general 
purposes In some instances such as the London Hospital 
and in certain localities such as Birmingham Shrewsbury 
and Halifax hospitals are exempted from rates by local 
statutes and the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh is exempt 
from municipal rates by statute In Ireland all hospitals and 
other charitable institutions are exempt It thus appears 
that numerous anomalies exist in the rating of hospitals and 
that in different localities the various rating authorities take 
diametrically different views as to the obligation of hospitals 
to pay rates 
The Argument for Exemption 
The Committee is of opinion that there can be no dou6t as 
to the force of the claim for exemption set up by the hospital 
authorities when viewed from a philanthropic standpoint 
Hospitals are everywhere doing a great work in relief of human 
suffering They are almost always hard pressed for funds 
They to a great extent relieve the rates and it was established 
by evidence that were the exemption from rates granted in 
London several hundred additional beds could be provided 
while the increase thrown upon the ratepayer would be merely 
nominal Evidence to this effect was also given from 
Liverpool 
It has been suggested that if relief were granted to hospitals 
and similar institutions it would be impossible to resist 
the claims of other charitable institutions of a different 
kind and that consequently there would be no logical 
stopping place short of the principle adopted by the Legis 
lature in Ireland by which relief is granted to all charitable 
institutions as well as hospitals With regard to this the 
Committee points out that there are considerations which 
distinguish voluntary medical hospitals from all other 
charitable institutions  they are absolutely necessary every 
where  they assist all classes  they are generally open at all 
hours for the admission of the suffering without inquiry or 
recommendation they prevent the spread of disease they 
advance the cause of education and science Hence the Com 
mittee has been led to regard this difficulty as not of itself 
sufficient to prevent it from recommending that exemption 
should be granted 
Recommendations 
The Committee recommends that the principle of exemption 
from rates should be applied to all medical hospitals infirm 
aries or other institutions for the care and treatment of 
persons suffering from sickness or injury or afflicted in mind 
or body not carried on for profit or gain and supported 
wholly or in part by voluntary contributions or endowments and 
directly benefiting the rates in the county or district in 
which they are located to a greater extent than they pay 
rates It is further recommended that any Bill introduced to 
give effect to this principle should confer power upon the 
rating authorities to deal with the question either wholly or in 
part and that where the rating authority does not act under 
this provision such institutions may appeal to the County 
Council or such body as is the central rating authority and 
that these bodies should exempt such hospitals or hospital 
from rates provided that they come within the abovenamed 
definition 
It is also recommended that the central rating authority 
should be empowered to arrange for the distribution of the 
loss inflicted by exemption in any one rating area over those 
areas which are directly benefited by the hospital or other 
institution or to make good the loss out of the county fund 
and should be allowed to make any grant out of the county 
fund to relieve the rates assessed upon hospitals or other 
institutions which in their discretion they may think proper 
At the midsummer meeting of the AustinFlint Medical 
Association at Clear Lake Iowa USA a vote of thanks was 
passed to Dr C Y Pearson of Cork for his services to the 
son of a member of the Association Dr Pearson was at the 
same time elected an honorary member of the Association 
Prince of Waless Hospital FundAmong the latest 
contributions received at the Bank of England for the Prince 
of Waless Hospital Fund for London is the annual subscrip 
tion of iooo from the Drapers Company The clerk to the 
company Mr W P Sawyer when forwarding the cheque 
wrote that 
 
the Company learnt with much satisfaction from 
the last report of the Prince of Waless Hospital Fund that 
the committee have appointed visiting subcommittees con 
sisting of persons practically acquainted with hospital 
management with the object of obtaining information as to 
the merits and needs of the various institutions The Com 
pany regard this as a most important step towards promoting 
the wellbeing of metropolitan medical charities and 
strengthening their claims on public benevolence
