fact he did not know where they would have been without 
them He recalled that the Secretary of State had recently 
recognized the services of the Volunteer Medical Corps at the 
front by incorporating them with the RAMC Vol and 
abolishing the compound titles a concession that had made 
the Brigade Bearer Companies a little jealous Some of the 
speakers had referred to the want of discipline in the St John 
Ambulance Brigade he thought they were mixing up the 
Association with the Brigade as there was strict discipline in 
the latter the men being turned out at the end of the year if 
they did not make themselves efficient 
SurgeonMajor Hutton in reply said he was glad the paper 
had led to such an ample discussion With regard to the 
division of orderly duties it was not such an easy question as 
some of the speakers had thought No doubt it was desirable 
especially in war time and he felt that everything would be 
done to effect this The main object of his paper was 
obtaining good recruits for the Royal Army Medical Corps as 
hospital orderlies and in doing so to select men of good 
character with a sense of duty and thought the St John 
Ambulance Association might be the means of supplying 
through its classes all over the country good recruits if 
encouraged by the authorities No doubt the hospitals in 
London and in the towns throughout the country would be 
willing to afford assistance for St John Ambulance men 
receiving some training in nursing duties to those men who 
wish it and that would be a further inducement for the 
Royal Army Medical Corps to support and encourage the work 
of the St John Ambulance Association 
THE TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL WOUNDS 
IN WAR 
By CharlesRoberts MB BS FRCS 
Resident Surgicar Officer Manchester RoyalCnrmary late Civil 
Surgeon So nth African FielaForce 
In discussing the treatment of abdominal wounds in war we 
have to consider i the nature of the injury 2 the cases in 
which operative interference is indicated and 3 to what 
extent the prospectof success of abdominal operations is 
diminished by the difficulties inseparable from campaigning 
When the wound is caused by a highvelocity and mantled 
bullet of small calibreas the Mauser and LeeMetfordthe 
extent of the visceral injury depends little if at all upon 
the range at which the bullet is fired except in some instances 
in which the wound is complicated by injury to bone At 
very long ranges when the force is spent and in ricochet 
wounds the bullet may be retained The course it takes 
within the abdomen is then lost and the internal injuries 
maybe widespread and with difficulty made out Where 
both wounds of entry and exit are present the track is 
always that of a straight line drawn between these two 
points and from anatomical knowledge we are able to say 
what viscera may have been injured Transverse wounds 
are more fatal than those passing in an anteroposterior direc 
tion Wounds above the umbilicus are more favourable than 
those below Direct anteroposterior wounds in the small in 
testine area are very unfavourable Complete transverse 
wounds above the umbilicus are very unfavourable That 
the small intestine area may be crossed without perforation 
occurring has been demonstrated  
1 By examination after death In the published record 
of the work of the Portland Hospital in South Africa written 
by the professional staff a case is described the details of 
which were supplied by Mr Cheatle Two perforations were 
found in the caecum and sigmoid flexure of the colon and 
though the bullet had undoubtedly crossed the area occupied 
by the small intestine no wound of the bowel had occurred 
2 By examination during lap aro to my Mr Makins in his 
work on his Surgical Experiences in South Africa gives an 
account of an operation in which two linear rents were found 
in the jejunum involving the peritoneal and muscular coats 
only He also noted in other instances linear ecchymoses 
and wounds of the peritoneal and muscular coats alone associ 
ated with complete perforations The view that the intestine 
escapes perforation in many of the cases that recover is sup 
ported by the fact that frequently so few abdominal symptoms 
arepresert 
It is difficult to believe however that in all cases no per 
foration is present for in many shock is severe frequent 
vomiting persists for two or three days the temperature rises 
and the abdomen becomes rigid and painful these symptoms 
being readily attributable to the shock of perforation and 
slight local peritoneal infection the necropsy in Mr Cheatles 
case previously mentioned showed that no extravasation of 
faeces had occurred from a perforation of the caecum and in 
cases operated upon no free escape of faeces has been found 
before manipulation Sometimes thepresence of melaena has 
formed strong evidence of perforation There is little doubt 
that a perforation may heal primarily or become shut off by 
 adhesion to a neighbouring coil within a few hours 
In considering the cases in which operative interference is 
required we must first exclude those wounded who will die in 
the first twentyfour hours from intraperitoneal haemorrhage 
or from the shock of the extensive internal injuries and who 
are not amenable to surgical treatment Their number is 
always considerable probably from 20 per cent to 30 per cent 
of those wounded Where increasing peritoneal haemorrhage 
is threatening life and the surroundings and general condi 
tion of the patient allow of it laparotomy must always be 
performed and the bleeding arrested whether from torn 
vessels in the omentum or mesentery or from laceration of 
the liver or spleen Only too often however extensive 
visceral injuries will also be found and a favourable result 
will not be obtained Wounds of the liver kidney and 
spleen as a rule heal well and when haemorrhage is not 
dangerous require no operative treatment except for 
secondary complications such as biliary fistula nydro 
nephrosis or perinephric abscess Laparotomy may be 
required when perforation of the stomach or bowel may have 
taken place 
If we exclude those who die in the first twentyfour hours 
we may estimate that of the cases of penetrating abdominal 
wounds amenable to surgical treatment about 60 per cent 
will recover The recoveries however are chiefly amongst 
those cases in which the area of the small intestine is not 
crossed and when this area is involved the mortality is pro 
bably very great Too often without exploration we cannot 
be sure whether perforation exists or not and whilst a routine 
laparotomy is not justifiable in every case it should be per 
 formed at the first evidence that perforation exists Such 
evidence may be found in the persistence of shock a steady 
increase in the rate of the pulse and in the abdomen becom 
ing increasingly rigid and tender and especially is it probable 
if vomiting has persisted and the passage of flatus is arrested 
Under these circumstances and when the surroundings are 
such as not to expose the patient to fresh dangers the opera 
tions should not be delayed andthe apertures may be dealt 
with by suturing or the area of the wound may be resected 
according to the condition found Especially is the operation 
likely to be successful whn the injury is localized the patient 
is seen within six hours of being wounded and transport has 
not been difgcult When the bullet is retained or tne track 
is a complete transverse one the prognosis is far less favour 
able K 
The results of laparotomy for gunshot wounds in war have 
been most unfavourable In the SpanishAmerican war Senn 
reported that all cases he knew of that were operated on died 
In the Tirah campaign of 8 cases of penetrating wounds of 
the abdomen 5 were operated on and all died In the Boer 
war I only knew of 2 successful operations performed for 
wounds of the small intestine In the American war in the 
Philippines Dr Robinson reported that 5 cases were operated 
on and 4 died The unfavourable results are attributable to 
various causes The severity of the injuries the delay in 
bringing in the wounded difficult transport and the unfavour 
able surroundings render abdominal operations at the front in 
mosteases unpermissible We are led to the following con 
clusions 
1 That as a rule the conditions in a field hospital are not 
suitable for performing laparotomy Moreovermany patients 
with penetrating abdominal wounds recover without opera 
tion and in the majority of those who die the nature of the 
injury is such that death must result whatever be the condi 
tions of operation and an exploratory laparotomy may add a 
fresh danger to the patient 
2 Wh n occasions arise in which the conditions of operation

approximate to those in civil practice laparotomy should be 
undertaken for increasing intraperitpneal haemorrhage en 
dangering life and when there is evidence that perforation of 
the stomach or bowel probably exists provided that the 
patient is seen early enough 
Dr Forbes Ross said that he had listened with great 
pleasure to Dr Robertss paper which went to prove that the 
smallbore bullet was the most humane implement yet 
invented for war The axiom in abdominal smallbore 
bullet wounds do not operate had now become a military 
medical actuality In fact the surgeon in these cases was 
more deadly than the enemy armed with the smallbore 
bullet Mr Clinton Dent at Ipswich and Sir Frederick Trves 
had foreshadowed this result which was now fairly accurately 
settled 
A FEW OBSERVATIONS MAINLY  CONCERNING 
THE REDCROSS BADGE 
By Deputy InspectorGeneral Porter CB RN 
In the late war in South Africa regrettable recriminations 
took place on both sides regarding alleged abuses of the 
Geneva Cross These appear to have in a great measure 
originated in misunderstanding due to preventable causes as 
well as in the changed conditions of modern warfare Smoke 
less powder the increased range of weapons and the possi 
bility of using artillery with precision against unseen adver 
saries have all combined to widen the modern battlefield In 
this way not only the combatants but the necessary adjuncts 
of armies medical and other are brought under fire At 
Magersfontein and at Paardeberg to quote from personal 
experience our field hospitals marked by Red Cros flags and 
pitched on sites selected with a view to nphexposure were 
shelled by the enemy In the former case even had the 
enemy distinguished the flags he could not be charged with 
deliberately firing upon them as he was shooting at extreme 
ranges of several thousand yards and could not possibly 
locate his objective within a hundred yards less or more In 
the latter case the formation of the ground precluded him 
from seeing his objectivea ridge intervened 
Consequently in these days when an engagement is pro 
ceeding the Cross is of value rather as a means of showing 
where aid can be obtained than as affording any specific pro 
tection to the wounded Of course when the fight is over the 
matter is different and the wearers of the Cross have their 
definite protective rights and limits in their own sphere of 
action These are fairly well understood by all men 
although very few even amongst medical officers have ever 
read the official conditions laid down by the Geneva Con 
ventions 
After making all possible allowances cases of deliberate 
abuse of the Cross occurred during the late war Perhaps 
the wonder is they were not more numerous when one 
remembers the lax discipline and the character of many of 
the mercenaries in the enemys ranks Besides the badge 
being of no particular size or material any one could fashion 
it and wear or hide it away at will  for example it enabled 
recruits for the Boers to cross the Portuguese frontier at 
Komati Poort Again the enemy when hard pressed by us 
as at Jacobsdal hid their Mausers donned Red Cross badges 
and so evading capture were able once more to fight 
against us 
What appears to be wanted is a uniform badge of strictly 
regulation pattern and materials  simple and at the 
same time not capable of being easily counterfeited 
This should be issued under proper authority to accredited 
wearers who should at the same time be supplied with 
regitered identification cards to be invariably carried on the 
person This card might also have printed on it the few 
more important laws regulating the Cross and the penalties 
of disobedience In like manner all Red Cross equipment 
such as ambulances cases of medical and surgical appliances 
comforts and so forth should be marked by authority and 
limited to their proper use In South Africa the enemy had 
all manner of vehicles adorned with red crosses A curious 
assortment fell into our hands after the fight at Modder and 
were magnanimously restored to Cronj although it was 
generally asserted they had been used for many purposes 
legitimate or otherwise accordingto the urgent needs of the 
moment So long as there is no punishment for painting a 
red cross on a case here and there even amongst friends the 
temptation to wrongdoing is great for example when the forced 
march is imminent and personal baggage is reduced almost 
to the vanishing point In the early days of our occupation 
of Bloemfontein certain ladies in virtue of wearing red cross 
badges they had fashioned for themselves managed to get up 
by train all 
theway 
from Cape Town at a time when the 
necessities of the military situation were extreme and the 
meagre railway transport was being taxed to its utmost 
These ladies were not nurses but all that befell them was to 
be returned whence they came Probably to this day they 
think they did a smart thing and are in no way conscious 
of being guilty of a discreditable action 
In the next naval war the care of the wounded will fall 
mainly upon hospital ships and their ambulance steam 
launches serving under the flag of the Geneva Convention 
Your modern ship of war is first and foremost a fighting 
machine and so while the best possible provision that the 
limited circumstances will admit of is made for the wounded 
yet military necessity must remain paramount and extensive 
space cannot be spared for hospital purposes In the brutal 
business of war methods which often appear harsh in the 
outset turn out to be really the most humane in the end 
During an action there must be suffering  probably little more 
can be done for the wounded than to promptly get them out 
of the way of the men fighting the guns relieve their pain 
8to bleeding and generally put them in the most favourable 
position for removal to the hospital ship after the engagement 
is over Special ambulance boats will then steam alongside 
and the wounded be promptly hoisted into them by such 
eminently suitable contrivances as the Kirker ambulance 
sleigh Here I would call attention to an obvious defect in 
the Red Cross flag  When flying in the bows of a hospital 
boat and at only a short distance off it closely resembles the 
St Georges Cross that is the official badge of a British 
Admiral It is quite conceivable in war time that the one 
might be mistaken for the other and disastrous results ensue 
say to a boat loaded with wounded The badge of the Geneva 
Convention afloat should be clearly outside the pale of pos 
sible confusion with any combatant device whatsoever and 
least of all an admirals flag 
The Geneva Convention has laid down certain regulations 
regarding hospital ships fitted out by private enterprise for 
the aid of belligerents irrespective of side  but it is I believe 
silent regarding the rights of Government hospital ships 
Are they liable to be made prizes of war If so will they 
first be permitted to convey their sick and wounded to their 
destination 
It would be well if some authoritative ruling could be 
arrived at as to what extent benevolent neutrality may go in 
the supply of aid to either belligerent Our Continental 
neighbours recently decried us for being so cruel as to refuse 
them permission to send ambulances through our lines to the 
enemy This at the time was specious  but we now know in 
the light of afterevents the gift of ambulances would have 
been the reverse of humane and would have served to pro 
long a useless struggle with the 
 
certain consequence of 
increased bloodshed 
To sum up finally regarding the badge  
i While easily recognizable it should not be easily counter 
feited or be capable of confusion with any combatant device 
in use afloat or ashore 
2 It should be issued under authority only When issued 
to individuals they also should be provided with means of 
proving their identity to friend or foe 
3 Abuses of the badge should entail definite penalties 
and as a rule these should be swift and severe 
In the last number of the Official Blue Bookthe Health of 
the Navy for 1900I dwelt at some length on the subject now 
discussed As however Blue Books are to most men sealed 
books and the matter is of importance I have therefore taken 
the liberty of bringing it before you and trust I have suc 
ceeded in making myself clear
