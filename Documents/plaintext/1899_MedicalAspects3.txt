REPORTS AND ANALYSES 
AND 
DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW INVENTIONS 
MEDICINAL AND DIETETIC PREPARATIONS 
Spolette PowderWe bave examirned a sample of this pre 
paration which is made by Messra Wyleys of Coventry It 
is described as a  nonalkaline antiseptic soap powder 
which lathers very freely in cold and hard water the active 
antiseptic substance being thymol and it is suggested that it 
is specially adapted for the use of medical menw nurses and 
the travelling public The results of our analysis show that 
the preparation is a wellmanufactured dry soap powder 
devoid of free caustic alkali and containing thymol A small 
percentage of insoluble silicious matter is present and this 
has no doubt been added for the purpose of enhancing the 
detergent properties of the powder It is suggested by the 
makers that the preparation is a convenient one for medical 
men to carry in their instrument cases The powder is used 
by placing it on the hands previously wetted and when this 
is properly done an abundant lather is produced The use of 
thymol instead of carbolic acid may be regarded as a distinct 
advantage in many respects as it is a powerful antiseptic and 
does not affect the skin in the same way as phenol We think 
that the preparation deserves the attention of the profeesion 
Alknburys Toilet SoapIt is claimed that this soap which 
is manufactured by Messrs Allen and Hanburys is a super 
fatted soap made from pure fats and that it is specially suited 
for tender and sensitive skins The results of our analysis of 
asample of the soap show that it is a wellmanufactured toilet 
soap of very good quality It is devoid of free caustic alkali 
and of any mineral or other substances which could be re 
garded as adulterants The soap is  superfatted and isapure 
and high class preparation

THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGN2ER 
III 
IT is cheering news when all news is so scarce from South 
Africa to learn that our forward movement has at length 
begun and has been celebrated by victories under Lord 
Methuen north of the Orange River and well on the way to 
Kimberley The main feature of the engagements at Belmont 
and Enslin was the steady advance of our infantry under a 
heavy fire until they were actually within bayonet thrust of 
the enemy This method of charging at close quarters com 
pletely demoralised the Boers and when adopted has in 
variably led if not to their actual rout at least to their 
retreat At the same time the p rice paid for this mode of 
attack is necessarily dear althouRh looking to the number of 
men engaged on both sides at Belmont the number of killed 
and wounded on our side cannot be regarded as exceseive 
KILLED AND WOUNDED AT BELMONT 
Lord Methuens returns to date are 4 officers killed and I9 
wounded and 55 rank and file killed and 128 wounded In a 
previous letter when discussing the proportion of killed to 
wounded I commented on the fact that the latter bore an 
unusually large proportion to the former unfortunately the 
same cannot be said of the casualties sustained in the Belmont 
engagement We must infer that the large number of propor 
tion of killed in this engagement was due to the close character 
of the fighting and the short range of the rifle shooting At 
long ranges it is evident that the wound of the Mauser rifle 
may frequently be a comparatively trifling affair It is pro 
bable that even at short ranges the wound inflicted by this 
bullet in the limb is not a severe one but the chances of 
shooting men in a vital part are of course increased as the 
range diminishes and we must infer that the short range of 
this engangement probably enabled the Boers to take more 
accurate aim and that the increased mortality was not due to 
any change in the character of the missile but to the faet that 
the shooting was of a much more accurate character It will 
however be of interest to learn whether the Free State Boers 


DEC 2 18991 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF TEE BOER WAR DAZAL 1557 
and especially those fighting in this engagement were all so 
universally armed with the Mauser rifle as the Boers of the 
Transvaal I have known the Free State for many years and 
during my acquaintance down to quite a recent time the 
majority of the Boers were in the habit of using the Martini 
Henry It is possible that they used this arm to some extent 
at Belmont As already stated the MartiniHenry bullet is 
much more deadly than the Mauser and at close quarters the 
shooting may easily be quite as accurate The Times corre 
spondent states that the Boers used some Dumdum bullets 
From this we are led to suppose that some of the Boers must 
have been armed with the Lee Metford rifle as it was for that 
arm that the Dumdum bullet was originally prepared 
although it is possible that the reference may be to a Mauser 
bullet prepared on the Dumdum pattern 
DIsPOSITION OF THE WOUNDED 
The railway is open to Belmont and the wounded at 
Belmont both Boer and British have been sent to Orange 
River and from there to Beaufort West and Capetown 
Beaufort West is a picturesque town in the heart of the 
Karroo with a good though small hospital of its own Should 
a further engagement as is anticipated cccur at Modder river 
and be followed by the same successful result it is probable 
that any wounded there may be at that point will be carried 
forward to Kimberley itself where the accommodation for 
treating both sick and wounded will be ample and complete 
Kimberley has an excellent hospital with 3oo beds and is a 
town containing many buildings which might be used for the 
reception of wounded if necessary 
HEALTH OF TROOPS IN NATAL 
From Natal the information to hand is somewhat confusing 
but there is no indication of any considerable outbreak of 
either typhoid or dysentery among our troops While food 
supplies and water are available for the different garrisons as 
there is every reason to suppose they will continue to be there 
is no reason to anticipate any great degree of sickness The 
climate is a healthy one and unless exceptionally unfavour 
able conditions arise the health of the troops should remain 
good and their vigour unimpaired 
MAFEKING 
Reports from MafekiDg state that the continued shelter 
which the garrison are compelled to take in the underground 
holes together with a short and indifferent water supply are 
producing a certain amount of dysentery among the garrison 
This will probably only be of a sporadic character but at the 
same time it is devoutly to be hoped that this plucky little 
garrison will be relieved before many days have gone by It 
is quite possible that the bold policy of striking directly at 
the heart of the Free State Bloemfontein would more effect 
ually relieve the various besieged garrisons by necessitating 
the withdrawal of the enemy surrounding them than would 
separate expeditions to each garrison in turn Typhoid has 
not been referred to in any of the despatches made public and 
there is every reason to hope that it will not prevail to any 
extent 
ANTITYPHOID INOCULATION 
Whatever risk there may be in store from typhoid fever 
it is to be hoped that it has been minimised by the extensive 
use of antityphoid inoculation among our troops previous to 
embarkation or after their arrival in South Africa It is 
stated that as many as 70 per cent of the troops sent to the 
seat of war have been inoculated voluntarily This speaks well 
for the intelligence of the men and the persuasive power of the 
medical officers  it further shows the confidence which the 
men feel in the Army Medical Corps and the good relation 
ship that exists between that branch of the service and the 
fighting arm 
The statistics with regard to the efficiency of this prevent 
ive treatment of typhoid are not entirely conclusive at the 
same time they are sufficiently encouraging to warrant the 
further application of the remedy and in any case no evil 
results appear to follow its application although some days of 
malaise are usually suffered by the person inoculated There 
are two features about typhoid fever which render it specially 
desirable that this remedy should be found efficient for the 
protection of our soldiers In the first place the average 
British soldier leaving our shores is of the age most suscept 
ible to the disease in the second place having lived under 
more or less perfect sanitary conditions at home he has not 
been subjected to those immunising influences which an 
insanitary environment appear to induce It is notorious 
for instance that the native can tolerate conditions of insani 
tation with impunity which inevitably produces a high 
typhoid mortality among Europeans newly introduced to 
such conditions 
HOSPITAL SHIPS 
According to the statement of the DirectorGeneral at the 
dinner of the British Gynaecological Society the hospital 
ship Princess of Wales is intended to ply between the Cape 
and England and that the ship now being fitted by the Com 
mittee of American Ladies will also be employed in this way 
and not as floating hospitals to be moored either in Simons 
Bay or Table Bay 
They are a most interesting element in the preparations 
for the campaign and serve to illustrate perhaps as fully as 
anything could the close touch which is being maintained 
between the mother country and her eons fighting her battles 
in the southern hemisphere It is no exaggeration to say 
that the wounded in the present campaign will be more 
directly under control from home and infinitely better pro 
vided with both surgical and medical aid than were our 
forces at Waterloo The world has never yet had a more 
striking object lesson in the significance of modern ocean 
transport facilities than is offered by the whole of the present 
campaign 
HORSE SICKNESS 
One of the worst enemies to be dreaded during the approach 
ing summer after the Boers and possibly typhoid is what 
locally goes by the name of  dik kop  black tongue or 
horse sickness It is said to be allied to anthrax and re 
sembles Loodiana fever which attacks horses in India The 
microorganism responsible for it is said to be derived from 
the soil and the disease is most rife from about November to 
March Fortunately it is less prevalent on the plains than in 
the low country or on the coast This sickness occurs at 
times among horses in the form of an epidemic and kills 
them wholesale Colonial farmers believe the poison comes 
down with the dew at night and in the early morning It at 
any rate seems certain that the attacks are associated with 
the exposure to the night and early morning mists and horses 
kept in the stable or even in a  kraal  cattle yard from 
sundown until the sun is well up and has dried the grass do 
not contract it Many devices have been used to protect 
horses while campaigning or travelling in the open During 
the Zulu war nosebags of flannel were issued to protect horses 
from the night air to some of the cavalry These were kept 
on all night and only taken off when the dew had evaporated 
Very few horses protected in this way were lost during that 
campaign and it is to be hoped that similar precautions 
will be adopted with the cavalry in Natal at the present 
time 
BOER COMMISSARIAT AND MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS 
The Germans who left the Boer force in Natal and gave 
themselves up to the British stated that many of the Boers 
are starving and although we may venture to doubt that 
statement it is quite probable that the Boer commissariat is 
very much disorganised The system of supplies is of the 
most free and easy description many of the Boers bringing 
their own waggons and others having little or no pro 
vision for food Each burgher is a law and as far as may be 
a larder unto himself There is no systematic distribution 
of rations which ensures every man getting his share so that 
it is quite probable that some men have to go very short when 
the commando has been absent some weeks in the field What 
cattle are to the kaffir waggons are to the Boer The loss 
of 64 of these huge land transports each one drawn by i6 bul 
locks must have been felt very keenly by the Free State 
Boers at Belmont The Boer medical department is un 
doubtedly of a very primitive character Both at Ladysmith 
and at Belmont they appealed for assistance from our com 
manders in addition to leaving a number of their wounded in 
our hands At Elandslaagte many of the Boer wounded 
begged to be taken over by our medical men in preference to 
being left to their own At Pretoria they are better provided 
with surgeons but in the field the number of Boer surgeons 
must be very small
