THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE PORTLAND HOSPITAL IN SOUTH 
AFBICA 
By Anthony A Bowlby FRCS 
Senior Surgeon to the Hospital  AssistantSurgeon to St Bartholomews 
Hospital London 
Bloemfontein May Slst 1900 
Site of the Hospital 
The Portland Hospital arrived here six weeks ago having 
been sent up from Kondebosch as soon as the line was clear 
enough to allow it to get through these difficulties of transit 
being due to the destruction of the Orange River bridges and 
the urgent necessity of sending supplies of food and clothing 
for the army 
We found an admirable camping ground about a mile to the 
southwest of the town on the slope of a hill and near to 
excellent wells the water supply being indeed the chief 
attraction for much of the drinking water in the town itself 
was bad and it had to be carted to very considerable distances 
owing to the occupation of the waterworksby the enemy and 
the cutting off of the regular supply 
Enteric Fever 
The health of the troops was bad They had been without 
proper tents or shelter and the nights had often been pouring 
wet  the ground in many places was a swamp and much of 
it had been fouled Owing to the forced march from Kim 
berley many regiments were short of boots and clothing and 
food had been scanty and men had frequently been on short 
rations There was therefore plenty of reason for sickness 
and diarrhoea and dysentery were common There was unfor 
tunately a worse enemy to come and within a few days of 
their occupation of Bloemfontein enteric fever broke out 
in many camps and spread rapidly It appeared to have been 
brought in by the men in many cases but it is certain that in 
many other cases it was acquired through bad water or other 
local insanitary conditions and various localities such as 
ThabaNchu acquired a bad reputation which was very well 
deserved At this time there were no general hospitals at 
Bloemfontein and in spite of utilising many public buildings 
in the town the field hospitals rapidly became overcrowded so 
that they had to accommodate three or four times the num 
bers for which they were equipped and it became impossible 
to nurse or treat the patients satisfactorily 
As soon therefore as we were ready to take the patients the 
tents were filled with cases of enteric fever from field hospitals 
and it became necessary to increase the hospital accommoda 
tion by the addition of more tents so that we soon had 160 
beds instead of ioo We put aside two large tents holding 18 
beds each for the treatment of enteric alone but unfortunately 
these were quite insufficient for all our cases of this class 
which at one time reached nearly ioo 
The Wounded 
The opening of Nos 8 and 9 General Hospitals now enabled 
the field hospitals to empty in part at least and to join in the 
general advance and a few days after we arrived our first 
wounded were sent to us whilst within the next fortnight 
some 60 or 70 of them came into hospital They were chiefly 
men of the cavalry and mounted infantry and almost all were 
wounded by Mauser bullets though one at least had been hit 
by an expanding bullet 
Among the first thirtyfive men who arrived no fewer than six 
had been wounded in the kneejoint In two of these the lower 
end of the femur was broken across and comminuted and in 
two others it had been simply bored through without any 
transverse fracture In another case the upper end of the 
tibia had been similarly perforated and in the sixth patient 
the bullet had passed through the left thigh and lodged in 
the right knee This man was also the subject of enteric 
fever at the time he was shot but this made no difference to 
his wounds which healed well on the left side at once though 
the entry wound over the right knee did not close till the 
bullet was extracted after he had passed through a very severe 
attack of enteric fever In the case of the patient shot 
through the tibia the joint remained painful and swollen for 
several weeks and showed a decided tendency to contraction 
and ankylosis though there was no tendency at all to suppura 
tion and no pyrexia 
Another interesting case was that of an officer shot in the 
gluteal region two days before admission  the bullet had not 
perforated and there was much stiffness of the hipjoint The 
x rays showed the bullet lying close to the articulation and 
an exploratory operation disclosed it embedded in the bone 
forming the upper part of the acetabulum a position from 
which it required a good deal of force to extract it This 
officer had previously been in the Portland Hospital for a 
wound through the right side and he again returned to his 
regiment a fortnight after the bullet was removed from the 
neighbourhood of his hip joint 
At one of the numerous fights near the waterworks the regi 
ment known as Marshalls Horse suffered severely 
especially in officers Of these one was killed the major 
himself was shot through the left lung and three of his juniors 
were also hit One of these had a slight flesh wound of the 
arm but the other two were both severely wounded In one 
of these the bullet had entered the middle of the third sacral 
vertebra and had emerged through the abdomen two inches 
above the spine of the pubes and two inches to the left of the 
middle line There wasno symptom of peritonitis so no opera 
tion was performed Recovery was uninterrupted save for a 
curious attack of localised pain with rapid pulse and pyrexia 
three weeks later which however passed away in a day or 
two A temporary incontinence of faeces suggested injury of 
the sacral nerves where the bullet hadtraversed the spine but 
this trouble lasted only a few days 
Boer Bullets 
As to the bullets used by the Boers the majority are certainly 
Mauser though not only have we seen several wounds caused 
by expanding bullets but Mr CuthbertWallace found at 
Winberg a large number of expanding bullets of many varie 
ties and it is curious that in some commandoes at least the 
use of them is increasingly common Shell wounds are very 
few 
Wounded Boers 
We have had six wounded Boers amongst our patients all of 
them Free Staters from the De Wets Dorp commandolarge 
limbed wellbuilt men One of them had a fractured femur 
and another a bullet through the knee with partial paralysis 
j of the parts supplied by the external popliteal nerve but there 
was no appreciable difference between the wounds inflicted by 
the LeeMetford bullets and the Mauser Four or five men have 
had typhoid fever as a complication of their wounds but the 
latter have done quite well in spite of this 
The Climate 
The climate at present is excellent The days are bright 
clear and sunny and the air is dry The temperature falls 
suddenly directly after sunset which is now at about 5 pm 
and the nights are cold and often frostywe had half an inch 
of ice in our buckets last week It is said by the people here 
Athat enteric fever always stops when the frost begins so it is 
to be hoped that this will be the case again 
MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
Mr BurdettCouttss Allegations 
The Times on the June 27th published a letter dated Cape 
town May 29th from Mr W BurdettCoutts in which he 
alleges that the medical arrangements in South Africa have 
failed to keep pace with the epidemic of typhoid fever which 
has caused a very large number of cases of illness especially 
among the troops in and about Bloemfontein He gives a 
graphic and very distressing account of the overcrowded con 
dition of a field hospital used as a stationary hospital in 
Bloemfontein 
The letter as it stands would certainly convey the impres 
sion and as a matter of fact has conveyed the impression 
that the deplorable condition under which Mr BurdettCoutts 
described cases of typhoid fever to have been treated in this 
field hospital were typical of those to which the majority of the 
patients who have been treated at Bloemfontein have been 
subjected Mr BurdettCouttss allegations the gravity of 
which he states he fully apprc cates undoubtedly demand the 
mesv sean hng eximinato With no desire to condone or

excuse such deficiencies as he alleges to have existed we may 
point out that Mr BardettCouttss statements are in some re 
spects contrary to information in our possession He makes 
no mention though his letter is dated May 29th of the three 
large military general hospitals which as we stated last week 
were in full working order early in May and had apparently 
been taken into use some time during the previous month if 
not earlier 
There is no doubt that there has been a great deal of typhoid 
fever in the army especially among the forces engaged north 
of the Orange River Mr Fripp the Chief Surgeon of the Im 
perial Yeomanry Hospital in a letter dated June 4th informs 
us that he had shortly before visited Bloemfontein and 
Kroonstad In Bloemfontein there were at that time over 
5000 sick most of whom were suffering from enteric fever  
while in Kroonstad the three hotels the Town Hall and the 
church had been converted into hospitals even the billiard 
tables being requisitioned to accommodate cases of enteric 
fever He adds that as the railway had been opened the 
SurgeonGeneral was engaged in rapidly pushing up adequate 
hospital accommodation The train in which Mr Fripp re 
turned brought down 241 sick to Bloemfontein where they 
were admitted into one of the general hospitals bringing the 
number of sick it contained 
 
to the huge total of 1800 Mr 
Fripp describes the water supply all over the country as ex 
tremely bad 
 
Water he says 
 
in the small streams at 
the bottom of the river beds is often very muddy Dead 
horses are generally to be seen in the streams and they are 
never above the strong suspicion of being typhoid infected 
It is impossible for all water that is required for drinking pur 
poses to be boiled  there is not fuel enough 
Sir William Thomson writing from Bloemfontein early in 
May stated in a letter published in the British Medical 
Journal of June 2nd that there were between 3000 and 4000 
sick in the town and that of these 1200 were cases of enteric 
fever He stated that the three general hospitals were 
crowded that several of the public buildings were utilised for 
the accommodation of the sick and that there were in the 
town in addition the Irish the Portland and the Langman 
Hospitals

 These figures are for the fortnight April 7th to 21st and May 26th to 
June 9th They were published as figures for the fortnight no tables 
having been published for the weeks ending April 14th and June 2nd 
The amount of sicknes3 in the forces in South Africa has 
been large about 7 per cent but this is less than in previous 
campaigns The exact figures are not available but the 
above table compiled from the official returns issued by 
the War Office shows the number of officers and men who 
have died of disease in South Africa from the middle of 
February to June 23rd The number of deaths attributed to 
enteric fever is not distinguished but there can be no doubt 
that a very large proportion have been due to enteric fever 
and a large number also to dysentery It will be remembered 
that Cronje surrendered on February 27th and it will be seen 
that a sudden rise in the number of deaths from disease 
occurred between three and four weeks later Mr Watson 
Cheyne attributed the great amount of typhoid fever preva 
lent in Bloemfontein at the end of March and the beginning 
of April to infection by the polluted water of the Modder 
river which the troops were compelled to drink during the 
time for which Cronje remained in his laager and Mr Bowlby 
whose letter is printed above appears to entertain a similar 
opinion though he speaks also of other infected places It 
will be seen also that there was another sudden rise in the 
number of deaths from disease in the weeks ending May 19th 
and 26th  this was some seven or eight weeks after the water 
works of Bloemfontein were occupied by the enemy and 
the water supply cut off Whether these two circumstances 
are to be connected or not it will be as yet premature to con 
jecture  
Letter from Mr Treyes 
We are indebted to Mr Trves for the following letter which 
he has written in response to our request for his opinion  
SirI have read Mr BurdettCouttss letter in the Times 
of to day and am shocked and surprised at the report he fur 
nishes 
I left Natal in March some time after the relief of Lady 
smith and the account I gave on my return to England of 
the work of the Army Medical Service in Natal was based  
upon my experience up to the period of my departure 
Mr BurdettCoutts comments upon this account as if it  
dealt with events which were to be in the future rather than 
with events which have happened in the past 
To every word I have said as to the excellence of the army 
medical arrangements in Natal I adhere most absolutely 
It is difficult to believe that a department which stood with 
such credit the exceptional strain of the Naial campaign can 
have suddenly exhibited the alarming collapse depicted by 
the writer of the letter in question My experience had in 
duced me to think that the organisation of the Army Medical 
Service was sound and good that the general scheme of work 
and of administration was efficient and that the lavish 
arrangements planned by the DirectorGeneral were carried 
out by his subordinates in a liberal thorough and business 
like manner 
There was no evidence of the intervention of red tape nor of 
hindrance by petty formalities and the hospital work was 
not only not hampered by other departments but was helped 
in every way with the heartiest readiness 
I cannot think that our sick have been treated with 
 
neg 
lect and 
 
inhumanity as Mr BurdettCoutts asserts 
Instead of neglecting their patients the surgeons I met 
worked with heart and soul sparing themselves in no par 
ticular and of the untiring and unselfish devotion of the 
nurses I have already spoken 
This war has been a war of surprises The casualties have 
been higher than the gloomiest ever dreamt of and there was 
no reason to anticipate that the outbreak of enteric fever would 
assume the enormous proportions it has assumed 
The circumstances of war unfortunately render an immense 
amount of suffering and distress absolutely unavoidable and 
the difficulties of furnishing adequate supplies from a far 
distant base are extreme 
I left South Africa with the impression that nothing more 
could have been done to mitigate the sufferings of the sickt 
and wounded than had been done when a temperate regard 
for the circumstances of war was kept in mind 
The Army Medical Service can lay no claim to the gift of 
prophecy nor to the power of anticipating the future but so 
far as any reasonable foresight can go the department seems 
to have done all that in fairness could have been expected of 
it Mr BurdettCoutts will no doubt substantiate the points 
detailed in his report but his preliminary account is conveyed 
in language which so savours of the theatrical that it fails to 
carry with it an overwhelming conviction 
Mobile field hospitals if they have to do the work they are 
intended to do cannot take beds with them It is better for 
a typhoid patient to lie upon a blanket and waterproof sheet 
on the groundas Mr BurdettCoutts describesthan to be 
hurried helterskelter to the base 
No human being can tell how the progress of an epidemic 
may proceed nor how the numbers of the sick will be distri 
buted Preparations may be made for 1000 and the admis 
sions may not reach 10 It is impossible to avoid overcrowd 
ing at times and equally impossible to provide in every

detail for emergencies which no reasonable foresight could 
anticipate 
That our gallant soldiers should suffer is deplorable indeed 
but the blame must fall rather upon the miserable fortunes of 
war than upon a department which has spared neither men 
nor money nor care nor devotion in a work which has assumed 
dimensions out of all proportion to that anticipated at the 
outset 
The seat of war is at least three weeks distant from theseat 
of supplies and in those three weeks a region free from disease 
may become the seat of a desperate epidemic The move 
ments of the troops cannot be exactly foretold It would be 
tetter for the country to be flooded with doctors and nurses 
rather than that the soldiers should suffer but it is quite im 
possible that the medical arrangements can at a time of war 
overthrow all those circumstances of transport and supply 
upon which the conduct of the campaign depends 
Unfortunately in war the war comes first but I should 
imagine that in no campaign has there ever been such 
solicitous and successful care for the sickYours faithfully
