SouthWestern Railway Companys carriage works the 
exterior is of a lightcoloured polished wood and is 
ornamented at the centres with the naval crown over the St 
John Ambulance badge Altogether this  medical and 
surgical comfort 
 
reflects great credit on the naval medical 
administration the designer and the builder The illustra 
tion Fig i shows the interior arrangements of this am 
bulance railway carriage 
The Royal Naval CotHere the superior advantages of this 
longestablished cot may be described  it consists of a flat 
wood frame of some 7 ft in length and i ft in width  the 
frame is secured in canvas which forms the bottom sides and 
ends  the latter above the cot proper are brought up to an 
apex with suitable arrangements for slinging it to hooks on 
board ship or to a ridge pole for hoisting it in or out of a ship  
by the Arm wooden frame it can be hand carried  the patient 
if necessary can be laced into it by the canvas sides  it would 
apparently be impossible to improve on it for the transport of 
helpless patients and we have known of it being extremely 
valuable if not indispensable in removing a critical case 
from her bed at her residence to a mail steamer at a foreign 
port the naval seamen and midshipmen in charge proving 
themselves perfect bearers in that case 
The Royal Naval Ambulance Steam Launch 
Cotemporary with the provision of a royal naval ambulance 
railway carriage the naval authorities have established at 
Portsmouth two ambulance steam launches for the transfer of 
naval sick cot cases and the more ablebodied from ships and 
transports at Spithead as well as from the harbour ships at 
Portsmouth to Haslar Hospital situated near a creek leading 
out of Portsmouth Harbour and where a pontoon landing 
place is provided with a covered way leading to the railway or 
tram carriage fitted to transport these cots and more able 
bodied sick to that hospital distant about aquarter of a mile 
from this landing 
This ambulance twinscrew steam launch was designed 
under the late naval medical administration the arrange 
ments were arrived at by the medical authorities at Haslar 
and the constructors department Portsmouth Dockyard who 
have achieved a longdesired reform in this matter 
Previously each ship sent its sick including cot cases to 
hospital in their own steam launches or larger boats with no 
special provision for the purpose  this entailed a large expen 
diture of labour and but little comfort to the sick Now by 
the provision of two of these ambulance twinscrew steam 
launches the sick can be collected from all ships at suitable 
hours and time of tide and conveyed in comfort to Haslar 
These ambulance launches work on alternate days and thus 
secure a continuous system of efficiency 
The arrangement on board the ambulance steam launches 
will be readily seen from the sketches given Figs 2 and 3 
They are 72 feet in length and have 15 feet beam amidship 
with a draught of about 3 feet Owing to a comparatively flat 
bottom they roll somewhat in a seaway or in the wash of 
steamers in the harbour  their length entails great care in 
piloting them up Haslar Creek which might be advan 
tageously dredged to render the hospital more accessible by 
the launches at all states of the tide 
 
In the fore part of the launch on battened shelving is  
accommodation for 12 naval cots in two tiers  the after cot 1 
spaces can be screened on if necessary from the foremost  
ones  the shelves are provided with steadying brass 
 
lugs i 
but the spring framerests for the cots are not provided as in the  
railway ambulance carriage  these would be a desirable fitting i 
The cot compartment is reached by a broad staircase with  
hooded covering  lockers are placed on the sides of the boat 1 
at the foot of the staircase and outside the sliding double 1 
doors enclosing the cot space Abaft this cot compartment 
is the engine room and the twin screw propellers and in c 
the stern sheets space is found for seats for the more able t 
bodied patients and the patients effects bags chests etc I 
The cot compartment has two raised skylights overhead fore s 
and aft of it for ventilation with candle lamps on the sides t 
for artificial light when requisite c 
Eighty thousand dollars have recently been given for the I 
purpose of building a new laboratory of physiology and r 
anatomy in Cornell university t 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
AT BLOEMFONTEIN 
By Sir William Thomson 
SurgeoninChief Irish Hospital Field ForceSouth Africa 
The Move of the Irish Hospital to Bloemfontein 
The troops which entered this town after the series of vic 
tories by Lord Roberts were half starved and the horses were 
mere shadows Before anything could be done in further 
operations it was necessary to get up food and general sup 
lies 
and what it meant to feed 50000 men 
along 
a single 
ine of rail 750 miles from the base may easily be imagined 
At last orders came for our section under Dr Stoker to re 
turn to De Aar and that the portion with myself should march 
to Norvals Pont and having joined there proceed by road to 
Bloemfontein The tents and some of our baggage were con 
veyed by train and this party and myself reached Bloemfon 
tein on the morning of April 1 ith The rest of the corps 
with the exception of two orderlies with a waggon still de 
tained in the Prieska district arrived on April 21st after a 
trying march 
Colonel Stevenson the PMO assigned us a very pleasant 
camping ground on the slope of the principal hill which over 
looks the town and in a short time we were able to take in 
patients A large number of these were suffering from enteric 
fever and some were wounded These unfortunate fellows 
had been lying on the giound in field hospitals and had had 
long distances to travel Two of them were insensible when 
they arrived and in spite of all the care we could give never 
rallied For others the evil day was only postponed and in 
the first week we lost eight men Later on other consign 
ments arrived Some of the wounded had been two days in 
bullock waggons with but little to eat yet bearing their 
distresses with characteristic bravery 
On the afternoon of May 2nd a convoy of wounded arrived 
in bullock waggons after a march of fortyeight hours in 
charge of Dr Enfeelbach civil surgeon They were men of 
the 12th Lancers and other cavalry regiments who had been 
surprised while watering horses after a days engagement 
While they were clumped together in the water some guns 
including a VickersMaxim were turned on by the Boers with 
serious results One man a sergeant of the 12th Lancers was 
struck on the right side of the head by a pompom shell It 
carried away a large portion of the parietal bone and brain 
substance was freely oozing out He was quite insensible  
the wonder was that he lived so long An exploration with 
the finger discovered a cavity about the size of an egg and 
lying near the petrous portion of the temporal a large frag 
ment of bone He lived until next day It was then found 
that the vault was extensively fractured and that it was only 
held in position by the scalp 
Wounds of the Knee 
A fine young fellow of the same regiment was struck in the 
very centre of the popliteal space by a fragment of shell Dr 
Engelbach said the haemorrhage was so severe that he thought 
ihe artery had been ruptured He had securely bandaged the 
part and controlled the vessel with a tourniquet On exposing 
ihe parts I found an extensive penetrating wound occupying 
he popliteal space and a large fragment of shell embedded 
n the soft parts anteriorly The finger passed easily in from 
ehind and I then found fracture of the head of the tibia the 
nner condyle broken off obliquely into the shaft and general 
lisorganisation I accordingly amputated the limb One of 
he large venae comits was open for about an inch The artery 
tad escaped but was thrombosed 
I have had two cases of gunshot wound of the kneejoint 
ne by a Mauser bullet one by a MartiniHenry In the first 
he bullet entered below the base of the inner condyle and 
assed outwards and upwards There was much effusion 
ttended by starting pains A radiograph by Dr Friel showed 
hat a large oval fragment about 3 inches long had been raised 
ff the lower end of the shaft There was a little fever but 
he wounds healed without suppuration and the patient has 
een sent to the Cape In the second case the bullet was 
emoved on the field by cutting down at the inner margin of 
tie patella and a little below The MartiniHenry bullet has

no nickel covering and is composed of lead and in this case 
its extremity had spread and the cupshaped expansion was 
filled with bone Here there is some fever but in spite of the 
severe wound I hope the case will do well 
Wonderful Escapes 
There are other cases of bullet wound of the limbs and 
thorax which are proceeding satisfactorily Of the curiosities 
which one meets here I may mention two Just a week ago 
a man of the ioth Hussars was shot through the nose The 
bullet entered the left ala just above the margin passed 
through the septum and out through the right ala No dress 
ing was required after the fourth day and the wounds are 
represented by two small upright lines 
A sergeant of the 12th Lancers was badly contused over the 
inner condyle of the left humrus A pompom shell entered 
his haversack behind traversed his notebooks and letters 
and escaped in front He had some extravasation of blood 
about the elbow and tingling along the ulnar nerve but he 
was otherwise unharmed Another man was knocked off his 
horse by a glancing blow of a  
pompom 
 
on the right side 
just above the zygomatic arch Beyond an abrasion and much 
headache he is very well 
The Hospitals in Bloemfontein 
The stress and consequent exhaustion of the weeks of 
marching and fighting which culminated in the occupation of 
Bloemfontein have told their tale Today there are between 
3000 and 4000 sick in this town and of these 1200 are enteric 
cases This gives an idea of the amount of work to be done 
The military general hospitals 8 9 and 10 are crowded 
No 9 has already 1500 patients Several of the public build 
ingsthe Raandzaal Grey College and othersare utilised 
for the accommodation of the sick and in addition there are 
the Irish Hospital the Portland and the Langman They are 
by no means too numerous indeed they are not by any 
means sufficient to relieve the strain and one only hopes that 
the cooler weather and the rest which the troops have had may 
help to lessen the streams of sick which flow daily into the 
town 
The Ambulances of the Irish Hospital 
The waggon equipment of the Irish Hospital fifteen ambul 
ances has been found of inestimable advantage to the local 
medical authorities No other hospital here except the 
Australian is supplied with such means of transport We 
have carried hundreds of sick and wounded for the various 
hospitals which have no efficient means of conveyance 
THE SPECIAL HOSPITALS 
Imperial Yeomanry Hospital 
We learn from Mr Alfred Fripp that the site at Deelfontein 
proves on further acquaintance to be very well adapted for the 
purposes of the hospital In the middle of April it contained 
550 beds and it was the intention shortly to raise it to 750  
this would be rendered possible owing to SurgeonGeneral 
Wilson having sent fifteen extra tents In consequence of 
the great number of cases of enteric fever at Bloemfontein 
numbering close upon 2000 all 
surgical 
cases were then being 
sent as soon as possible to the various hospitals south of the 
Orange River  some went to the Scottish Hospital at Norvals 
Pont others to the General Hospital at Naauwpoort others 
to the Stationary Hospital at De Aar which had 300 beds and 
a considerable portion went to Deelfontein The air of the 
place was beneficial to the wounded who as a rule soon 
learnt to do justice to the products of the French cook who 
Eroduced 
admirable dishes from 
unpromising 
material The 
ospital also contained many cases of enteric fever but the 
proportion was tending to diminish The detachments from 
the St John Ambulance and the London Fire Brigade had 
worked well both in establishing the hospital and in tending 
the sick 
The Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital under Major Ston 
ham spent some hours at Deelfontein before resuming the 
journey northward and the staff were in hopes that it would 
be in time to be included in Lord Robertas advance 
The Langman Hospital 
By the request of the Principal Medical Officer at Bloem 
fontein the Langman Hospital of 100 beds has been con 
verted into one of 150 the necessary equipment for which has 
been provided by Mr Langman and despatched to South 
Africa The medical staff has been increased by the appoint 
ment of Mr W W Woolliscroft MRCS late HouseSur 
geon to Charing Cross Hospital 
WITH THE NATAL FIELD FORCE 
From an Occasional Correspondent 
Since the relief of Lady smith the troops have been encamped 
at strategetical points along the Natal Government Railway 
including Colenso Ladysmith Modder Spruit and Elands 
laagte Most of the troops which formed the Ladysmith 
garrison are at present at Modder Spruit and the men are 
rapidly regaining health and strength The rainy season in 
Natal is now over and the weather and climate are all that 
could be desired The days are bright and pleasantly warm 
the nights cool and refreshing Dysentery is still very pre 
valent amongst the troops but simplecontinued and enterie 
fevers are rapidly diminishing 
Rations 
A greater variety in rations is now possible For the time 
being tinned provisions are no longer in use Fresh beef of 
mutton is issued daily and vegetables are obtainable in fair 
quantities Fruit consisting of delicious oranges and pine 
apples can be purchased in practically unlimited quantities 
The only alcoholic drink obtainable by the men at present is 
beer manufactured by the Natal Brewery Company Most of 
the units in Natal have arranged for a supply of this but the 
daily issue is wisely limited to 2 pints a man 
British Red Cross Society 
This Society has now started a branch in Ladysmith and I 
doing excellent work The officials there as elsewhere are 
eminently obliging and are always glad to see officers of any 
branch of the service at their office They have large supplies 
of warm underclothing and medical comforts on which officers 
in command of units are allowed to draw to an almost un 
limited extent 
Field Hospitals 
In one of his interesting letters from Chieveley published 
in the British Medical Journal for March 24th 1900 Mr 
Frederick Trves FRCS describes a visit to one of the 
field hospitalshospitals whose officers have as Mr Trves 
justly observes the heaviest duties the greatest share of 
hardships and I am afraid the least credit for their splendid 
work A brief description of the personnel and work of a 
field hospital will no doubt interest your readers The 
per 
sonnel consists of 4 medical officers a quartermaster and 35 
noncommissioned officers and men Each hospital left 
England with this establishment complete Since taking the 
field however numerous casualties have occurred amongst 
both officers and men until at the present moment many of 
the field hospitals are working with little more than half their 
original establishments 
Each hospital is equipped with its own transport medical 
and surgical panniers and tents calculated for 100 patients 
In sudden emergencies however some at least of the field 
hospitals have treated as many as 300 sick and wounded at a 
time during the present campaign obtaining additional tents 
from the regiments of the brigade to accommodate them 
Under ordinary circumstances a field hospital has 40 tents  
one square operating and 39 circular tents  25 of there are for 
the accommodation of sick the remainder are occupied by 
the personnel surgery office packstore etc The hospital is 
pitched on a regulation plan with mathematical accuracy the 
space occupied being 70 yards by 160 yards 
Afield hospital is essentially a mobile unit as it must 
accompany its brigade wherever and whenever it moves 
When a march is ordered the hospital tents must be struck 
and they and the equipment packed on the waggons by the 
hour appointed The personnel and waggons then move off 
immediately in rear of the troops and in front of the brigade 
baggage waggons On completing the march of say ten to 
fifteen miles or sometimes more the men have to mark out 
a new camp on carefullyselected ground to unpack the 
equipment to pitch the tents and to dig kitchens ashpits 
I and latrines The officers and men have then to commence

HILTJukb j 190a 
their duties of attending to the sick and wounded Leisure 
is an unknown luxury to them and the weekly or biweekly 
holiday enjoyed by other branches of the service is only 
known to them by name If an action is in progress there 
may be a sudden and large influx of wounded As each 
wounded man reaches the hospital he is examined  his name 
with full particulars is entered in the Admission and Dis 
charge Book and in addition on the 
u 
Return of Wounded  
and on the latter his wound is classified according to its 
degree of severity its locality and the projectile which 
caused it Operations of emergency such as removal of 
bullets ligature of bleeding vessels or amputation of badly 
shattred limbs are performed The wound is then dressed 
antiseptically and the patient is ordered whatever nourish 
ment and extras are considered suitable to his case 
The officers 01 the field hospitals are also responsible for the 
selection of cases for transfer to the base and have to be 
careful to exclude all cases which are unfit to travel When 
a large number are pouring into the hospitals this is no light 
duty They also have to prepare the hundred and one re 
turns which are required in the field and must be ready at ail 
times to answer queries about the wounded If the action is 
severe or prolonged they have to snatch food and sleep 
as best they can the latter probably lying on the ground 
in clothes and boots which may not have been changed for 
days 
From this it will be seen that Mr Trevess reference to 
 
the heaviest duties the greatest share of hardships is 
fully justified Let us hope however that the latter part of 
his sentence about the  least credit will not be justified in 
the present instance The officers of the field hospitals have 
worked with the utmost courage skill and devotion and 
they certainly merit a due share of any rewards which may 
be distributed Their work is apt to be overlooked as it is 
not done in the public view It is however of the first im 
pt tance and the splendid results obtained in the stationary 
and general hospitals during the present campaign would 
have been impossible were it not for the care with which the 
field hospitals have carried out their important duties 
The work of a medical officer on field service is no doubt 
arduous and the life is not devoid of hardships Taking the 
rough with the smooth however campaigning in South Africa 
is full of variety interest and excitement which cannot be 
quailed under any other conditions whilst the experience 
gained is quite unique 
The Fifth and Sixth Brigade Field Hospitals which were 
unavoidably left in Natal when their brigades proceeded to 
join Lord Robertas forces in the Orange Free State have now 
been ordered to rejoin their original brigades much to the 
delight of all concerned 
The Victoria Cross 
The announcement that the Victoria Cross had been con 
ferred on Major W Babtie CMG for his heroism at the 
battle of Colenso which reached Ladysmith on April 22nd 
was received with universal satisfaction In his capacity of 
Secretary to the PMO Major Babtie has endeared himself 
to every officer of the corps in Natal It is rumoured that at 
least two other medical officers with the Natal Field Force 
have been recommended for this coveted distinction for 
conspicuous bravery during the attack on Pieters Hill 
namely Captain J H Campbell and Lieutenant E T 
Inkson The case of Captain Campbell has already been 
referred to Lieutenant Inkson has in reality earned the 
Cross on at least three different occasions At the battle of 
Colenso he was in medical charge of the Royal Artillery and 
was conspicuous for his disregard of danger and for the cool 
ness and constancy with which he exposed himself to the 
hottest fire whilst collecting and dressing the wounded H 
was then transferred to the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and 
with them was present at each of the subsequent battles At 
the battle of Spion Kop he dressed the wounded for five 
consecutive days under the hottest fire from the Boer trenches 
At the attack on Pieters Hill he was in charge of the 
Inniskilling Fusiliers and dressed the wounded where 
ever they fell Finally he was left alone in an advanced 
position with a wounded field officer He brought the 
officer back unaided under a murderous fire from the Boer 
trenches 
THE ACTION AT TALANA HILL DUNDEE 
We are indebted to Major J F Donegan RAMC Officer 
Commanding No 18 British Field Hospital for some notes on 
the wounds and injuries treated in that hospital after the 
action on October 20th 1899 The total number of wounded was 
105  of these 6 were dangerous including 1 officer 79 severe 
including 13 officers and 3 hospital bearers and 20 were 
slight Of the slight wounds all had completely healed by 
October 23rd By October 30th 30 of 79 seriously wounded 
men were available for duty their wounds being either healed 
or in the stage of granulation Up to the date of leaving 
Dundee November 3rd 5 patients had died and 1 case likely 
to die a wound of spine was left behind unfit to travel The 
fatal cases were wounds of stomach and intestines vault of 
skull and brain and a severe wound of lung They unfor 
tunately included MajorGeneral Sir William Penn Symons 
KCB who died on October 23rd while the hospital 
was in the hands of the Boers Throughout there 
was only one case where pus formed in the locality 
of wounds  a severe wound of the leg with splin 
tering of bone When the hospital moved only four 
cases were left behind as unfit to travel one officer 
wounded in three places the case of spine and leg wound re 
ferred to and also a wound through the hipjoint They 
were progressing most favourably with the exception of 
the spine case which was considered mortal from the 
first 
One officer was wounded by three distinct bullets 1 officer 
and 18 men were wounded twice with different bullets there 
being an interval of time between the injuries in some cases 
or when the first wound was not in his own estimation suffi 
ciently severe to prevent the man doing his duty This is an 
instance of the bravery and determination of the British 
officer and soldier in the attack on Talana Hill 
One man wounded through the lung and liver with unmis 
takable symptoms was able to sit up in bed ten days after 
injury and on arrival at Ladysmith on November 4th 1899 
he had almost recovered 
Two men were shot through the neck the bullet entering 
the mouth and injuring the soft palate and tongue They 
suffered exceedingly for some days but eventually re 
covered 
Three cases of penetration of the kneejoint did excellently 
recovering without a rise of temperature In two of these 
three stiff joints will undoubtedly result but even this is 
satisfactory when compared with wounds of this locality in 
the NorthWest Frontier campaign where there was hardly a 
recovery on record the injury requiring amputation in almost 
all cases 
In 16 cases the bullets were lodged in the tissues  14 of 
these were removed  2 were left in situ one in the lung ap 
peared to do no harm and the other situated deep in the 
muscles of the buttock could not be located without rray 
examination  only one amputation was performedremoval 
of fingers Major Donegan attributes the favourable results 
to the following causes  
1 To the Mauser bullet itself which is a merciful pro 
jectile at long ranges only followed by fatal results in the 
case of injury to large arteries vital organs and intestines 
2 To the bullet being nickelcoated and therefore aseptic 
3 To its tendency being more to penetrate than to smash 
and destroy tissues at long ranges 
4 To the manner in which the wounded were dressed and 
attended to in the field and also to their rapid removal to 
shelter This necessitated the Indian bearers working under 
tolerably heavy fire but under the supervision of officers 
warrant officers British noncommissioned officers and men 
attached to hospital they carried out their duties in the most 
satisfactory manner and by availing themselves of all cover 
escaped with only 3  casualties At this date no wheeled 
transport had been supplied on this account the removal of 
the wounded from the field had to be commenced the minute 
the infantry advanced otherwise they would have been left 
out all night In all about 241 wounded were removed by the 
dhoolie bearers from the field of action to the field and 
temporary hospitals The battle lasted from 5 am to about 
230 in the afternoon of October 20th 1899 
5 To the excellent and careful manner in which all cases

were attended to at the dressing station by Major Kerin

The Etiology of Malaria 
Dr W S Thayer of Johns Hopkins University read a 
paper on Recent Advances in Knowledge concerning the 
Etiology of Malarial Fever After reviewing the recent work 
of Manson Ross Grassi Bastianelli Bignami and Celli he 
said the conditions in Baltimore appeared to be essentially 
the same as those in Northern Italy In that city they 
observed the main variety of mosquito the Culex pungens 
while in the suburbs they had found numerous examples 
of other Culices especially the C t niorhyncus and the 
C triseriat Repeated feeding experiments with different 
Culices upon human beings and upon birds infected with 
Laverania Danilevskyi were without result At Sparrows 
Point a most malarious district in the suburbs and in a 
number of houses in the neighbourhood  beside the ordinary 
Culices there were found to be great numbers of the Anopheles 
guadrimaculatus Say This Anopheles both in the markings 
upon its wings and in its gross appearance was very similar 
to the Anopheles claviger In several examples of this mosquito 
obtained from the room of a patient suffering with malaria 
there were found in the stomach wall characteristic encapsu 
lated refractive pigmentcontaining bodies corresponding in 
every way to the extracorporeal stages of the tertian parasite 
In two examples of the Anopheles guadrimaculatus fed upon a 
patient whose blood contained fullgrown tertian parasites 
Dooley in their laboratory had been able to obtain similar 
bodies In one A guadrimaculatus fed upon the blood of a 
patient containing crescentic bodies there were found in 
the stomach wall about thirty hours after feeding two 
lanceolate pigmented bodies in every way corresponding 
to the earliest stages of the extracorporeal phase of the sestivo 
autumnal parasite The relation of the distribution of Ano 
pheles to the prevalence of malaria had not yet been carefully 
studied in the United States He concluded by saying that 
it might be considered as proved  t That the malarial 
parasite possesses an extracorporeal cycle which is completed 
in the stomach wall of mosquitos of the genus Anopheles  
2 that members of the genus Anopheles are capable of trans 
mitting malaria from infected to noninfected individuals 
There was reason to believe that if in any given region 1 
proper measures for treating the spring relapses of malaria 
were adopted and 2 efficient measures for destroying the 
dangerous mosquitos in their larval stage could be carried out 
the prevalence of malaria might be materially controlled 
Bacteriology of Dysentery 
Professor Simon Flexner who discoursed extempor 
aneously on this subject said the attempt to establish a 
common etiological factor for all cases of dysentery had thus 
far failed When one recalled the protean nature of other 
infectious diseases among the most common of which were 
tuberculosis and typhoid fever there could be no a priori 
objection to the hypothesis that the causative agency of 
dysentery need not necessarily vary for each of the many 
types cf the disease that had from time to time been distin 
guished That the lines of demarcation between the several 
clinical and pathological types should be inaccurate was not 
a matter of wonder The terms catarrhal tropical 44 
epidemic and 4tdiphtheritic were far from signifying 
sharpcut entities The clinical manifestations and patho 
logical lesions of the catarrhal variety occurred in all kinds of 
dysentery and in all places where the disease prevailed The 
distinction between tropical dysentery which was character 
ised by ulcration and thickening of the intestinesespecially 
the colon the lesions beginning in the submucous coat of the 
gutfrom the epidemic disease in which a false membrane 
existed usually associated with ulcration without any 
primary involvement of the submucosa was far from sharp and constant In the United States diphtheria had not been 
commonly observed in the ulcerativo and amoebic form of 
dysentery while in Egypt the two pathological conditions 
were not infrequently found together 
Sociological Status and Evolution of the Physician 
At the second general meeting Dr William Osiers name 
was down for a paper on Modern Therapeutics but the 
audience was disappointed of the promised treat as the 
popular Baltimore Professor was unavoidably prevented from 
attending the Congress Dr Clarence J Blake delivered 
an address on the Sociological Status of the Physician and 
Dr S Weir Mitchell afterwards read a poem entitled The 
Evolution of the Physician 
The Medical School of the Future 
In the evening an address on this subject was delivered by 
Dr H T Bowditch of Boston He said one of the most 
hopeful signs of the times in the field of medical education 
was the growing tendency of the better schools to ally them 
selves to universities and of universities to establish medical 
departments It might be expected in the near future to 
find a better class of medical schools under the aegis 
of a university and they might reasonably hope that 
this change would be associated with a diminution 
of the total number of medical schools now so 
greatly in excess of the needs of the country It 
seemed to be evident that in arranging a course of medical 
study a distinction must be made between those subjects 
which it was essential that every student should know and 
those subjects which it is desirable that certain students 
should know In other words provision must be made both 
for required and elective studies Anyone familiar with 
existing methods of medical instruction was aware that in 
neary every department many things were taught which were 
subsequently found to be of use to only a fraction 
of those receiving the instruction To indicate better the 
nature of the reform which he advocated he described 
a possible arrangement of a course of study in the 
department of physiology with which he was more 
familiar than any other An experienced lecturer would 
probably find it possible to condense into a course of 
about forty or fifty lectures all the most important facts 
of physiology with which every educated physician must 
necessarily be familiar Attendance upon these lectures 
combined with suitable courses of textbook instruction and 
laboratory work would suffice to guard against gross ignorance 
of physiological principles In addition to this work all of 
which should be required short courses of not more than 
eight or ten lectures each should be provided giving advanced 
instruction in such subjects as the physiology of the special 
senses cerebral localisation nervemuscle physiology the 
internal secretion of glands the physiology of the heart 
circulation and respiration the digestive secretions the 
reproductive organs etc These courses should be elective in 
the sense that no student should be required to take them all 
Each student might however very properly be required to 
choose a certain number of courses which when once chosen 
become for the student choosing them required courses lead 
ing to examinations 
A similar arrangement of instruction could be advantageously 
adopted in the departments of anatomy histology bacteri 
ology medical chemistry pathology surgery and in the 
courses of instruction in the various special diseases such as 
dermatology ophthalmology etc In the existing state of 
medical education the introduction of the elective system in 
some form or other seemed to be an essential condition to any 
further important advance for the curriculum of most schools 
was already so crowded that no considerable amount of in 
struction could possibly be added 
If it were urged that the elective system in medical educa

tion would lead to the production of a class of physicians who 
owing to the early specialisation of their work would be in 
clined to overrate the importance of their speciality it might 
be pointed out that this result was apt to be due not so much 
to early as to imperfect instruction in the work of a specialist 
and that since the elective system tended to encourage 
thoroughness in special instruction the evil might be expected 
to diminish rather than to increase He proceeded to discuss 
how far the didactic and the laboratory methods of instruction 
were each adapted to secure these two objects of medical edu 
cation the distribution of the students work and the ques 
tion of examinations 
In conclusion he said it might be expected that a medical 
school of the first rank would in the immediate future be 
organised and administered somewhat as follows  i It will 
be connected with a university but will be so far independent 
of university control that the faculty will practically decide 
all questions relating to methods of instruction and the 
personnel of the teaching body 2 It will offer advanced 
instruction in every department of medicine and will there 
fore necessarily adopt the elective system of some sort since 
the amount of instruction provided will be far more than any 
one student can follow 3 The laboratory method of instruc 
tion will be greatly extended and students will be trained to 
get their knowledge as far as possible by the direct study of 
Nature but the didactic lecture though reduced in im 
portance will not be displaced from its position as an educa 
tional agency 4 The work of the students will probably 
be so arranged that their attention will be concentrated upon 
one principal subject at a time and these subjects will follow 
each other in a natural order 5 Examinations will be so 
conducted as to afford a test of both the faithfulness with 
which a student performs his daily work and of his per 
manent acquisition of medical knowledge fitting him to 
practise his profession 
The Work of the Component Societies 
The Association of American PhysiciansThe President of 
this Association Dr E G Janeway of New York showed a 
commendable example of selfrestraint by not delivering an 
address or as he himself put it by not consuming such time 
by his introductory remarks as to 
infringe upon what was the 
moral right of the members But for this he said he would 
have been tempted to touch upon the theme Truth in 
Medicine This could have been handled under such heads 
as truth in statistics truth in diagnosis truth in thera 
peutics and truth in pathology Among the papers read were

opinion was expressed that the absence of leucocytosis was an 
indication that a given case was not one of appendicitis but 
it was not pathognomonic Dr Ira van Gieson of New York aid he thought attacks of appendicitis were the result of the

American Gynecological SocietyDr G G Engelmann 
Boston who presided delivered an address in which he 
dealt with menstruation He said many investigators had 
shown that the wealthy and the cityborn were more pre 
cocious than their poorer or their countrybred sisters out 
his own investigations more especially indicated the influ 
ence of mental stimulus Thus out of 2315 patients who 
came under his observation in St Louis dispensaries the 
average age at which menstruation commenced was 1424 
years while Dr Chadwick of Boston had found much the 
same for in his 2500 cases the age was 143 years In 697 
cases from a consulting practice throughout the southwes 
tern States countrybred women the average age was 143 
years The average in 800 cases among Bostons highest 
class working girls was 14 years Among the high and nor 
mal school girls the 750 of whom statistics were collected 
gave the average of 138 years In 1200 college girls the 
average was 135 years Neither birthplace nor parentage 
influenced the development of the girl and the appearance 
of puberty as did the surroundings of childhood and early 
youth which gave a variation of one year as noted in the 
5000 cases which had been under oberservation Among 
other matters discussed the results of conservative opera 
tions on the ovaries and tubes a subject which was intro 
duced by Dr W L Burrage Boston His conclusions 
were that it is advisable to do conservative operations in all 
cases when the ovaries and tubes are not hopelessly diseased 
in all parts of their structure except on patients who are near 
the menopause  on patients who have pronounced gonorrhoea 
of long standing and in cases of malignant disease 
Dr A W Johnston read a paper on the Internal 
Secretion of the Ovary He said there was no proof 
that the ovary had any function other than the manufacture 
of eggs It was in no sense a gland The results produced 
by the administration of ovarian extract could be produced 
equally well by salt and soda as hysterical patients were easily 
influenced He condemned the practice of preserving a part of 
the tubes and ovaries as simply a postponement of trouble

on an experience of 8000 cases The prejudice against the 
use of ether in the presence of acute subacute or even 
chronic bronchitis was largely unfounded provided proper 
conditions were observed in its administration These con 
ditions included proper preparation of the patient that this 
anaesthetic be administered in the operating room the tem 
perature of which must be from 98o to iooF the chest and 
trunk of the patient lower than the pelvis and lower extremi

The test consisted in lifting at each alternate second with the 
middle finger of the right hand a weight equal to 7 per cent 
of the gross weight of the individual and permitting them at 
the next second to return Ninety seconds was the limit of 
the test during which time this weight was lifted fortyfive 
times a metronome being used to beat the seconds The 
ergogram indicated the degree of fatigue exhibited by the 
shild during the ninety seconds The work of the boys was 
better than that of the girls  the endurance of the girls up to 
14 years of age showed a greater percentage than that of the

boys The girls practically reached a maximum at 14 and 
from there on up to 20 years of age the limit of examination 
did not increase The boys however continued to increase 
continuously up to 20 and the ratio of increase was greater 
than it had been previously The amount of energy displayed 
by the girls at 20 amounted to very little more than half of 
that exhibited by the boys at the same age so marked was

THE ROYAL MEDICAL BENEVOLENT COLLEGE 
The annual general meeting of the Royal Medical Benevolent 
College was held on May 25 th Dr Holm an Treasurer in the 
chair The annual report stated that in spite of the war 
appeals the receipts both from annual subscriptions and from 
donations for general purposes were higher in 1899 than in 
1898 Special thanks were due to the Honorary Local Secre 
taries for their efforts in obtaining annual subscriptions Two 
special donations had been receivedone of 500 generously 
given by a governor whose brother had intended to leave that 
sum but had died before signing his will  and the other of 
458 given by 
 A few old friends in memory of the late Miss 
Elizabeth Salmon of Clifton The scrutineers had announced 
the result of the voting as follows  
Pensioners ElectedAnnie Blick John Charles Bonnett Elizabeth M

Vacancies having arisen within the prescribed time three j 
foundation scholars had been admitted by the Council after  
the last electionEdward Chamberlayne Alan H Parson  
and Robert H Shillingford A further sum of money having  
been received out of court for the Da Silva Foundation the i 
Council had awarded another pension so that there were now f 
two pensioners on that foundation The election that day t 
brought the number of ordinary pensioners up to 50 of Pugh j 
pensioners to 9 and of Morgan annuitants to 3 The Council e 
had to regret the loss by death of two vicepresidentsSir t 
James Paget and Mr John T Mouldwhile Sir Edward Sieve c 
king who was the first honorary secretary and had been for c 
many years a member of the council had resigned owing to t 
advancing years and illhealth The Duke of Abercorn had t 
resigned the office of president and the Council proposed the s 
Earl of Rosebery for election in his place The number of t 
boys in the school was 238 and numerous successes had been r 
obtained by boys leaving the school and by old boys during Q 
the year c 
Dr Holman in moving the adoption of the report said  1 
The policy of the Council has been to prepare students for t 
entering the profession of medicine and to give to all pupils a 
whatever the course intended for them a sound allround e 
public school education that they may be fitted to act not s 
only as medical practitioners or otherwise but also to hold p 
their own socially in the neighbourhood in which they live 0 
This is in exact accordance with the wishes and aims of the u 
founder of the College Epsom College is not a class school y 
but offers special advantage to the sons of medical men The n 
days of class schools are practically at an end and it is I 
desired to make Epsom College to all intents and purposes a o 
public school with a medical foundation Years since it was t 
a common complaint by doctors that they were not given any v 
social status either in private practice or in the public ser A 
vices It was evident to anyone looking into the question that n 
one cause was the frequent absence of general culture and t 
tone in those who were complaining The object at Epsom is e 
to turn out welleducated gentlemen and students of good  
tone and high aims and our experience is that by giving our h 
students the widest education possible we are enabled not only g 
to pass a large proportion through the stiffer medical exami ti 
nations but also to ensure their continuing to do well by t 
the avoidance of any sort of cramming We can often ii 
carry them further still and secure University distinc s 
tions I am referring mainly of course to those boys t 
intended for the medical profession Our average number 
of passes in the Matriculation and Preliminary Scientific Ex 
aminations of the University of London on which many 
not all of our valuable hospital scholarships depend will 
compare favourably with those of any other school 
Of late years we have also gained constantly University Open 
Scholarships won straight from Epsom Between Founders 
Day 1896 and Founders Day 1899 ten open scholarships or 
exhibitions at the Universities have been gained The two 
in 1899 were for mathematics In the British Medical 
Journal of this morning May 25th are published the results 
of inquiries by the General Medical Council into the prelimin 
ary examinations in England and Wales by various examin 
ing bodies At the matriculation examination of the 
University of London the percentage of rejections among all 
candidates is given as 522 of candidates from Epsom College 
it was in round numbers 35 per cent At the Oxford and 
Cambridge School examinations for the Higher Certificate the 
rejections are given as 437 per cent  of Epsom candidates it 
was in round numbers 20 per cent For the Lower Certificate 
the rejections are given as 44 3 per cent  of Epsom candidates 
it was in round numbers 25 per cent The general result 
is sufficient to show that our teaching is well up to the mark 
Some little time since my attention was drawn to the fact 
that we could not fill up annually the nine free scholarships 
most generously given us by the Metropolitan hospitals In 
all cases it was formerly a sine qua non that the ftudent 
hould have passed both parts ot the Preliminary Scientific 
Examination of the University of London and in three hos 
pitals the first division was required From our school of 
ander 250 boys not all of whom enter the medical profession 
we could not find 9 students out of some 50 leaving each year 
ibleto gain these valuable and much coveted honours on such 
conditions and it is clearly too much to expect The senior 
brm has sometimes had less than 9 boys This Preliminary 
Examination is composed of three subjects two of which 
nu8t be taken together and one standing by itself The can 
lidates from all parts and from many schools and hospitals 
rary in age from 17 to 25 years and upwards I found that by 
ar the larger portion of these candidates took this examina 
ion in two parts and the proportion passing in all three sub 
ect8 at once was very small indeed and is growing smaller 
ach year It is no part of my duty to a9k why this should be 
he case  whether it be the result of stiffer examinations 
r the poorer mental calibre of the candidates but this 
iscovery gave an ample answer to our position with 
he hospitals  and when the whole question was laid before 
he Deans of the various schools they at once allowed their 
cholarships to be awarded to students who had passed a por 
ion of this examination on the obvious condition that the 
emaining subject or subjects be passed so soon as possible 
hat the Deans thought our application a reasonable one was 
learly shown by their ready acquiescence with our request 
hat every year the candidates going up for certain examina 
ions vary much in quality is the experience of all teachers 
nd that all candidates with the very best intentions and 
very assistance from their masters can be made to pass 
ach examinations is again an assertion opposed to the ex 
erience of all schools The estimation in which a Wranglers 
egree is held by university men varies greatly depending 
pon the class of men who are competing in each particular 
ear That our boys as a rule do succeed in these higher exa 
linations is incontrovertible In 1899 9 lads went up for the 
reliminary Scientific Examination and 6passed in all subjects 
ne in Division 1 whilst the two others passed in one part of 
tie examination and one failed Two forms 25 in number 
ere sent in bodily for the matriculation and 16 passed 
Iter much thought and acting on the advice of our head 
laster and other educational experts well qualified to advise 
tie whole form is usually sent in A large percentage are 
xpected to pass  the remainder get over the stage fright of 
leir first interview with the examination papers and also 
arn what subjects they are weak in and to which they must 
ive more attention It is helpful both to teacher and 
wight and a sure test of general efficiency I wish it to be 
tioroughly understood that every boy intended for medicine 
 given the best possible attention and every chance of 
access by careful preparation and even when necessary 
y extra tuition and I may also assert that boys
