MEDICAL WAR NEWS 
Aamxc  YELLOW FEVER AT SANTIAGO ACeo00 tSa to the most recent intelligence the total number 
of cases of yellow fever in the American force at Santiago 
now exceeds 300 Among the sufferers is General Duffield 
The type of the disease is mild and few new cases occur 
There are very few cases in Santiago itself The total number 
of 4eaths up to July i8th is given as I2 
According to information from Spanish sources the total 
Spanish force in Guantanamo and Caimanera numbers 5000 
men Only about 3000 however are fit for service yellow 
fever being rife among them 
ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE RED CIROSS 
The New York Medical Record referring to reports which 
have been current in the yellow papers as to Spanish 
troops attacking Cuban hospitals and butchering doctors 
nurses and patients says that for a long time these reports 
were thought to be inventVions devised in order to arouse sym 
pathy for the Cubans Now however our contemporary adds 
any lingering doubts as to the truth of these stories and 
of the Spanish nations responsibility have been dispelled by 
the action of the Spaniards in shooting deliberately upon the 
American wounded and their bearers at the battle of Santiago 
de Cuba All accounts bf the battle it says agree in stating 
that the Spaniards paid no respect whatever to the Red Cross 
flag when flying on the American side On the other hand 
they made no scruple of flying the flag over some of their 
own most exposed blockhouses in order to protect them from 
attack One of their batteries it is said was masked by a 
blockhouse over which the Red Cross flag was flying and the 
road leading from General Shafters quarters on the Rio 
Sevilla to the front had for two days been infested at various 
points by sharpshooters who fired deliberately upon the 
American wounded A correspondent of the Sun states that 
while he was crossing a stream leading a mule bearing a 
wounded rough rider five shots were fired at them The mule 
was killed and Dr Danford a surgeon in the cavalry and at 
one time a surgeon underthe Cuban Government was mortally 
wounded by a bullet passing through his head A few 
moments later two other wounded men were shot at the same 
cTossing According to another correspondent one of the 
most horrible features of the war is the dozens of men who 
have been killed as they lay in litters and the surgeons 
alDthough wearing the emblem of the Red Cross Society on 
their arms have been the special object of attack 
Seven Spanish soldiers who are believed to have been in the 
band of sharpshooters who fired upon the American ambu 
lances at Santiago and killed Drs Danford and Troval have 
been taken and it is probable that they will be hanged 
In regard to these charges of deliberate firing on surgeons 
and bearer parties it would be weLI not to accept them 
unreservedly without conclusive evidence Such charges 
were made by both sides in the FrancoGerman War and 
indeed in every war since the Geneva Convention was made 
War as a great American general is reported to have told the 
cadets at West Point is not  all glory but  all hell and 
individual acts of savagery are sure to be committed even 
when it is conducted on the most humane principles

existing circumstances To this end all musicians will here 
after report to a medical officer attached to the regiment to 
which the band belongs for one hour each day for instructions 
until they are pronounced qualified by the medical officer who

numerical force and efficiency of firstaid bearers upon the 
battlefield Practically the instruction that band members 
are receiving consists of exercises in the manual of the litter 
namely marchings with the litter as litter squads composing 
a detachment so as to mobilise at a given point searching for
