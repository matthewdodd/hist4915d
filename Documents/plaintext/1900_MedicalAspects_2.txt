missioned officers and men was 436 136 being in cots 300 in 
hammocks which with 42 beds for officers made 478 or very 
nearly the accommodation of a general hospital at the base 
500 beds 
It was however found that the convalescent wards were a 
mistake as it was difficult to send the proper kind of cases 
for hammocks from the numerous hospitals upcountry It 
was then decided to convert the convalescent wards of all the 
hospitaL ships into wards with fixed cots and to put ad 
ditional cots into the wards previously fitted with cots The 
wards then held the following numbers all in cotsA 30 
B 38 C 50 D 55 E 40 F 39 and G 20 total 272 which with 
42 officers made 314 beds It should be mentioned that the 
beautiful little yacht Golden Eagle owned by Sir S Scott Bt 
was attached to the Nubia and accommodated 3 or 4 officers 
who were kindly looked after by Lady Sophie Scott and her 
maid a trained nurse When Colonel Gallwey CB the 
able Principal Medical Officer of the Natal Army formed the 
idea of fitting up hospital ships he hit on the only way out of 
4he tremendous difficulty which had to be faced by the rapid 
development of what was thought would be a short campaign 
into a very serious and big war There was great difficulty in 
establishing land hospitals not only by reason of the impossi 
bility of getting buildings cooks etc but also the feeding 
and supply which could much more readily be arranged on 
board transports with full establishments than lying idle in 
the roads The rush of wounded and sick was so great at 
times that it was absolutely necessary to find means of 
evacuating the field and base hospitals further up 
The Nubia received wounded direct from the battlefields on 
everal occasionsfrom Spion Kop Potgieters Pieters and 
from the fighting into Ladysmith After relief she received 
many of the sick from that town and took some home She 
was at the Durban base from January 5th to March 31st when 
she left for England with a full load of wounded and sick 
Some idea of the work done can be gathered when it is men 
tioned that during the above period about 1500 noncom 
missioned officers men and officers passed through the ship 
Of these one officer and six or seven men only died chiefly 
from enteric fever and dysentery contracted in the field 
Large numbers of both sick and wounded passed up to the 
front again having recovered rapidly  a considerable number 
were invalided being shattered by the hardships of the cam 
paign Nothing could have exceeded the cleanliness of this 
magnificent ship and it is a pleasure to feel that from first to 
last everyone pulled together with the greatest concord Dr 
Bensusan in addition to a full share of ward work manipu 
lated the rrays apparatus with signal success numerous 
bullets pieces of shell etc having by this means been 
detected and removed 
The following hospital ships were fitted up in Durban 
Lismore Castle Nubia Avoca Orcana Dunera all in a very 
short time The Maine was here the Spartan and Trojan 
and numerous transports have constantly been despatched 
home with invalids more or less convalescent showing the 
importunt part taken in this campaign by hospitals afloat

The Winter Climate op the Transvaal 
The climate of the Transvaal is at the present season cool 
and bracing although on the high veld which our forces 
now occupy the cold at night is often severe That the 
present season is winter and not summer in the Transvaal is 
still more fortunate for the health of the Boer forces and those 
British prisoners whom they have removed into the low 
country north of Pretoria From Pretoria northwards the 
country falls away to the valley of the Limpopo or Crocodile 
which forms the northern boundary of the Transvaal The 
country is broken by spurs of mountain and deep valleys and 
is largely covered by bush of a semitropical character 
Through the winter this district is healthy and the climate 
mild and delightful It is the low veld of the Boers and is 
resorted to every winter by farmers dwelling on the high 
veld who with their flocks and herds their families and 
waggons periodically migrate to the low veld during the 
winter months In moving to this district at the present 
time of the year the Boers are therefore merely following their 
usual practice although the conditions are materially altered 
The Lydenburg District 
In the early days of the settlement of the Transvaal Lyden 
burg was made the headquarters of the emigrant Boers and 
the Lydenburg Republic was one of the first Governments 
which existed in these territories Fastnesses to the north 
end of the Drakensberg in the immediate vicinity of Lyden 
burg offered ideal natural fortresses to which the Boers could 
retire after engagements with the surrounding Bantu tribes 
I once spent a few months in these mountains at the end of 
the winter and the beginning of the summer My tent was 
pitched on high ground and the entire camp of settlers around 
me were healthy but I can well recollect even so early as 
September seeing many virulent cases of malaria among men 
who had been prospecting for gold in the surrounding deep 
valleys on either side of the mountain range As a matter of 
fact during the summer under existing circumstances the 
large portion of the country intervening between Pretoria and 
Lydenburg is unhealthy to Europeans and the amount of 
malaria which occurs is considerable It is the fever of the 
summer months which has made the exploitation of the 
gold fields of the Zoutpansberg a northwestern spur of 
the Drakensberg both hazardous and costly Among 
these mountains is to be found one notorious laager 
known from the earliest days as the Ohrigstadt laager 
This interesting and fertile valley shut in in the mountains 
was described a few weeks ago by a correspondent of the 
Times of Natal who predicts that the old Bechuanaland free 
booters Adrian De la Rey Van Pittin and others will 
eventually retire there to join Abel Erasmus the Transvaal 
native commissioner in that district Here it is anticipated 
by this correspondent the last stand will be made On the 
merits of this programme from a strategical point of view it 
is not our province to comment but it must be borne in mind 
that such situations as these are surrounded during the 
summer months by large belts of terribly unhealthy country 
The Boers will thus be cut off from the outer world unless 
they are prepared to face malaria whenever they sally forth 
Water Supply and Sanitation on the Rand 
Typhoid which has played such havoc among our troops in 
the various camps is unfortunately only too common under 
what have hitherto been normal conditions in Johannesburg 
and at the various mines along the course of the main reef 
As the deep level mines are opened up and the 
population of Johannesburg increases the question of 
an abundant and pure water supply not only for 
Johannesburg but for the whole course of the reef 
will have to be faced One of the commonest causes of 
typhoid fever has hitherto been the continuous use of water 
from wells and other small local supplies as springs liable 
to pollution by surrounding surface drainage and by dust 
There can be little doubt that an abundant water supply from 
one end of the mines to the other would very materially 
reduce the high deathrate from typhoid fever The sanitary 
system in vogue in Johannesburg itself does not differ mate 
rially from that employed in Kimberley and the majority of 
other South African towns It is what is known as the pail 
system and one of the chief objections to it is the nuisance 
of the night service The huge waggons which are driven 
through the streets with an attendant train of natives during 
the small hours of the morning are foul things to encounter 
The other and perhaps the more serious objection is the ques 
tion of the disposal of slops which are too often distributed 
indiscriminately over the back yard if there be one or the 
adjoining street if there be not Theoretically this system is 
held to be safe but it is undoubtedly disagreeable and for 
those who object to a waterborne system of sewage Johannes 
burg and Kimberley offer enterprising communities and new 
scenes for the sanitary experts devices 
Casualties 
Among the deaths from enteric fever reported from Bloemfontein are 
Lieutenant C H B AdamsWylie IMS who died on June 2nd and Civil 
Surgeon H Bryant who died on June 7th Lieutenant AdamsWylie
