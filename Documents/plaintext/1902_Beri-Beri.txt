THE EPIDEMIC OF BERIBERI IN THE BOER 
CAMP AT ST HELENA 
In reference to Dr Patrick Mansons paper on the prophy 
laxis and treatment of beriberi being the opening contribu 
 tion to the discussion on beriberi in the Section of Tropical 
Diseases at the Manchester meeting1 Dr W A Wheeler 
Civil Surgeon in Charge of the Boer Camp in St Helena has 
described his experiences of the epidemic of this disease 
which occurred among the Boers there The facts as he 
jbelieves fully agree with Dr Mansons theory as to the pro 
duction of the disease by place infection 
 At first only a few isolated cases of beriberi occurred in the 
campt Dead Wood Plain but at the time of his arrival 
there in May 1902 the disease had become epidemic and a 
new isolation camp was established of which he had com 
mand and in which he had on an average 75 cases to treat 
In regard to etiology Dr Wheeler believes that all the 
causes ordinarily ascribed might be eliminated As far as 
alcoholism was concerned the Boers were well known to be a 
temperate race and as prisoners of war they had no possible 
means of obtaining alcoholic drinks and every man re 
turning to camp after leave of absence was strictly searched 
Rice was at no time issued as partof the rations Arsenic 
was carefully tested for in the drinking water with a negative 
result and if any had been present in tinned foods the home 
troops would have suffered equally as the rations for 
soldiers and Boers were identical Malaria was ordinarily 
unknown in St Helena and although it was common in 
someparts of South Africavet careful questioning of each 
patient in no case elicited a history of this disease 
On the other hand the conditions existing among the Boers 
would lend great countenance to the theory of place infec 
tion resulting in the development of a toxin outside 
the body The Boers had been confined to one camp 
of 3000 men for over two years The greatest care was 
taken as regards drainsge latrines removal of night soil 
etc but even so the grouud could not possibly have 
escaped being fouled during this long time Again the 
large majority of those attacked were old men so to 70 
men who in their own country had been accustomed to 
a free active life but who now as prisoners moped took no 
exercise ate and slept too much and stayed mostly day and 
night in small huts with every aperture closed They never 
washed their bodies and never changed their clothes Conr 
ditions such as these in conjunction with fouled ground 
would naturally bring about a state of affairs favourable to 
the production of a toxin The mosquito could be eliminated 
in this case for the camp was at an elevation of 2000 ft 
and a strong sea breeze was constantly blowing Dr Wheeler 
had never seen a mosquito there but vermin of other kinds 
were there in plenty 
The theory of place infection was also strongly borne out 
by the fact that on moving the invalids to a site hitherto 
unoccupied a most rapid and marvellous improvement took 
place The earlier cases had been sent to Jamestown Station 
Hospital at sea level and a fair number of these died  but 
41ter the establishment of the isolation camp at Dead Wood 
Plain there was not a single death every man recovered 
cjinpletely some in a weekor so others more slowly 
The treatment consisted solely in this change of location 
and in giving extra diet 1 tin of milk 2 oz of oatmeal and 
3 oz of whisky to each man 
As regards the ordinary diet it was at no time deficient 
 
and was identical with that of the home troops encamped 
on the same groundnamely fresh meat four days a week 
tinned meat two days vegetables and potatoes on alternate 
daysbread sugar and coffee It is true the vegetables were 
compressed and the potatoes were often not too good 
With regard to the water supply  on careful analysis this  
was found to be rather suspicious  both free and albuminoid  
ammonia were too high and there was too much chlorides  it 
was however passable However after the outbreak of beri  
beri among the Boers and of enteric among our troops only 
distilled water was 
supplied 
 With regard to the clinical symptoms  every case with two 
exceptions was of the dropsical variety and in many cases 
there was rapid oedema of the scrotum and penis The scrotum 
often swelled so enormously as to require punctures There 
was no retention no albuminuria no marked anaemia no 
marked paralysis except in two cases mentioned above  but 
always numbness and often complete anaesthesia of the legs 
great pain over the tibiae and the sternum and in the worst 
cases dyspnoea Appetite was good and the bowel functions 
normal The spleen was not enlarged 
In about 30 per cent of the cases the gums were spongy 
and the calves of the legs hard The two exceptional cases 
showed marked ataxic symptoms rapid emaciation and a 
lemon tint of the skin like that of pernicious anaemia But 
these also recovered entirely 
The following points were of most importance as bearing on 
the question of place infection 1 Nearly all the patients 
were old men 50 to 70 worn out by hardships and mental 
anxiety  2 the proverbial dislike of ordinary Boer to clean 
liness and ventilation 3 the prolonged residence on the 
same camping ground though the sanitation and food and 
water supply were carefully looked after  4 the total absence 
of any similar disease among the home troops encamped on 
adjacent land equally crowded sleeping on bare ground but 
accustomed to bathing parades and by nature cleanly  5 the 
epidemic of enteric among the troops at the same time as the 
outbreak of beriberi occurred among the Boers  6 the 
marked recovery of even the most acute cases after their re 
moval to fresh ground and the addition to the ordinary diet 
as compared with the considerable mortality among those at 
first sent to Jamestown 
 
 Colonel Williamson PMO Capetown laid considerable 
stress on the fact that 26 out of 78 cases then in the beriberi 
camp had come from the Potchefstrom district of the Trans 
vaal where a mild form of beriberi was supposed to be 
endemic But it is hardly likely that a man could carry a 
latent disease for three years 
In regard to Dr Mansons observations on the relation 
between beriberi sleeping sickness and malaria Dr Wheeler 
writes After having been in constant attendance on the 
beriberi camp for two months I went down to Jamestown 
one day when I was not feeling very well having had sub 
acute malaria for a few days In Jamestown I remarked to 
another medical man that I had a severe pain in the 
calf of my right leg and jokingly said I believe I 
have got beri beri myself I did not feel inclined for lunch 
and walked back to camp a distance of six miles up an ascent 
of 2000 ft When I arrived home I collapsed completely 
went straight to bed and did not waken for twentyfour hours  
then I slept again for three whole days without food or drink 
On the fourth day I wakened in hospital perfectly well except 
for slight numbness in the right arm and leg and pain in the 
wrists Drugs or alcoholism could be entirely excludedj I 
have always been strictly temperate and the causation 
puzzled everyone For myself I put it down to sheer exhaus 
tion but the paper referred to has suggested a possible con 
nection with beriberi I was never unconscious  only always 
wanted to sleep Three days of constant feeding made me 
absolutely well again in fact in better form than I had been 
for a long time 
 
During a residence of six years in tea districts in India I 
have naturally seen a large number of cases of the disease 
known there as beriberi and of malaria in all its forms I 
have also as a visitor seen the form of beriberi common in 
Singapore but this epidemic in St Helena has exhibited 
features very different from those in the other countries The 
icutenees of the cases the rapid recovery on removal to fresh 
ground the absence of all factors hitherto considered causa 
uve with the notable exception of that of fouled ground and 
personal uncleanliness is most remarkable
