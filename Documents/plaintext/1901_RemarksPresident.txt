INTRODUCTORY REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT 
ON THE WORK OF THE SECTION 
The Section over which I have the honour to preside was 
inaugurated last year under auspicious circumstances and 
this its second meeting promises to be equally successful 
The President of last year InspectorGeneral innis RN 
in his opening address said that he deemed it a happy omen 
that the new Section of the Association was inaugurated while 
the great war which he hoped was near an end had con 
centrated public attention on the medical services His 
anticipation of the early end of the war has unfortunately 
not been realised  it has gone on and afforded still further 
object lessons in all our military departments including the 
medical  while the reforms suggested in various directions 
have yet to be worked out and practically applied 
The objects and scope of this Section are wide and compre 
hensively expressed in its title  it may be taken to embrace 
matters relating to the personnel organisation and equipment 
and to the hygiene and surgery of our naval and military ser 
vices both in peace and war  while on the civil side it in 
cludes such problems as the provision of ambulances and 
emergent aid to sick and injured persons especially in our 
populous urban centres 
To facilitate procedure during the three days at our dis 
posal we propose to discuss  first naval  secondly military  
and thirdly civil matters so far as can be arranged 
On naval questions we are prom i sed papers by naval medical 
officers on most important subjects  namely the disposal of 
wounded in naval actions and the relative healthfulness of 
modern warships to which attention has lately been called 
 will not venture to anticipate what may be said on these 
matters further than to remark that while we probably have 
data sufficient for arriving at some definite conclusions as to 
the healthfulness of ironclads our experience is as yet very 
limited regarding the disposal of the wounded in modern sea 
fights The subject is complicated on account of the many 
different structural types of our warships each requiring 
special contrivances of their own I may be allowed to express 
much personal interest in such naval problems because of 
lasting early experiences  for it was my fortune to learn some 
thing of the interior economy of our wooden walls of fifty years 
ago having served for six months as a medical volunteer in 
HMS Duke of Wellington flagship of the Baltic Fleet of 1855 
and taken part in the three days bombardment at Sweaborg 
Such a reminiscence brings the obvious reflection how mar 
vellously and completely have naval life and warfare changed 
within my own limited recollection  
With the military medical problems which may engage our 
attention I am after fortyfour years consecutive and con 
tinuous service in the army naturally very fairly conversant 
I confess I regard these problems after the experience of 
many mutations both in the home and Indian services as 
still presenting grave difficulties and even dangers unless 
warily and judiciously handled Major Dick RAMC 
Assistant Professor of Military Surgery Netley was to have 
recounted some aspects of smallbore wounds as inflicted 
during the war which have come under his direct ob 
servation but we regret his inability to do so But Sir 
William MacCormac has promised some observations on 
War SurgeryOld and New to which his great experience 
4 
and authority will lend the highest interest We already 
know sufficient of such wounds to warrant the antici 
pation that when the full surgery of the war is made known 
we shall have some startling revelations especially in regard 
to penetration of viscera by smallbore bullets I lately saw 
a wounded soldier on sick furlough who while lying down 
was hit by a Mauser bullet the missile entered the right 
chest below the armpit and passing in a slanting direction 
emerged in the region of the left kidney From its course 
and the resulting symptoms several of the important viscera 
could not have escaped penetration  yet months afterwards 
when I saw him the only inconvenience experienced was 
occasional spasm of the diaphragm on sudden exertion 
When we meet with such cases and can recall the terrible 
visceral wounds inflicted by the expanding Mini bullet of 
forty years ago or even by the still more recent Snider or 
Martini the pencillike missiles of the latterday magazine 
rifles seem comparatively almost harmless 
Field transport for sick and wounded on which Captain 
Ward RAMC promises to give his recent war experiences is 
a subject of great importance and some difficulty  for it is part 
of the bigger question of army field transport at large which 
cannot or ought not to be fixed and fettered by inelastic 
rules  because it must vary widely according with three factors 
which may operate in any given campaign These are  the 
physical nature of the country in which military operations 
are conducted  the length of the lines of communication  
and the required mobility of the fighting force It is an open 
question whether the medical service should not have com 
plete autonomy in its field transport of whatever kind  but I 
am not inclined to lay much stress on the point further than 
that it should be autonomous subject alone to the express 
disposition of the general officer in command For necessity 
and especially military necessitycan have no law beyond 
or overriding that of preservation of the fighting force  and 
consequently however autonomous in theory the medical or 
other branches of transport may be there is always the risk 
even the probability that under the pressure of military 
exigency as after Paardeberg it may be appropriated for 
the supreme transport of food and ammunition 
Intimately bound up with the kind and amount of field medi 
cal transport is the question of its use under new conditions 
in affording first aid to the wounded in an action The enor 
mous widening of the zone of fire from modern weapons 
makes all active duties connected with stretchers and ambu 
lances increasingly difficult and dangerous It is now next to 
impossible with any safety for bearers to keep in touch with 
an advancing fighting line while the distances between the 
combatants may be so great as to render the distinguishing of 
red crosses and Geneva badges impossible  hence probably the 
complaints that the ambulances have been deliberately fired on 
Not only does the range of fire exceed that of unaided 
vision but the use of smokeless power makes location of a 
firing line more a matter of the ear than the eye  there is 
plenty of noise but little to be seen A wounded cavalry 
soldier told me he had been six times under fire but never 
once saw a living fighting Boer while engaged 
In means for affording civil first aid to sick and injured 
persons 
in our great urban centres we seem lamentably be 
hind many Continental and American cities We all trust this 
reproach may before long be removed It is a question 
whether motor might not be substituted for horse ambu 
lances for all emergent purposes Important questions con 
nected with enteric fever will be brought to your notice 
I have now the pleasure to invite you to proceed with the 
various matters that may come before us 
THE TREATMENT OF WOUNDED IN NAVAL 
ACTIONS 
By FleetSurgeon Gilbert Kirker RN MD MCh 
MRCS 
This subject may be conveniently dealt with under the three 
following heads  
i The surgeons station or the place where the wounded 
are treated 
2 The time of treatment 
3 The conveyance of the wounded
