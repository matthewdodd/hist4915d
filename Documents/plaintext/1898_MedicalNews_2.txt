RECORDS OF SICK AND WOUNDED IN TIME OF WAR 
The Act of the United States Congress approved April 
22nd1 1898 authorising the organisation of the volunteer army 
requires all regimental and other medical officers serving with 
volunteertroops in the field or elsewhere to keep a daily 
record of all soldiers reported sick or wounded as shown by 
the morning calls or reports which records at the disband 
ment of the organisations will be filed in the record and pen 
sion division of the War Department To permit of this ulti 
mate disposition of the medical records of the volunteers 
without interfering with the medical histories of men belong 
ing to the regular army medical officers who may have under 
their care patients belonging to both organisations will have 
to keep a separate set of records for each organisation The 
SurgeonGeneral of the army has therefore called upon the 
surgeons in charge of general hospitals to have separate 
registers of patients and monthly reports of sick and wounded 
made for regular and volunteer troops Similar instructions 
have been issued to surgeons in charge of hospitals in the 
field in which regulars and volunteers are likely to be treated 
side by side In time of peace monthly reports of sick and 
wounded are required to be forwarded in duplicate one copy 
to the Chief Surgeon and the other direct to the Surgeon 
General but during the war only one copy is called for to be 
forwarded from general hospitals direct to the Surgeon 
General and from field hospitals to the SurgeonGeneral 
through chief surgeons

resolution was passed onfering to the General Citizens Relief 
Committee the free services of medical practitioners to such

gratuitous medical attention 
BAKING OF BREAD IN THE FIELD 
The special correspondent of the Medical Newvs June I Ith 
at Tampa Captain and AssistantSurgeon H T Raymond 
gives an interesting account of the baking of bread in the field 
with the portable ovens described in the Manual for Army 
Cook8 issued by the United States War Department Brigade 
Commissary First Lieutenant Arthur Johnson 17th Infantry 
finding thathis regiment was taxed IOO lbs of bread for thebak 
ing of I96 lbs of flour by a civilian baker purchased two small 
portable ovens of a capacity of 96 loaves each andsufficient when 
worked by two soldiers to supply a regiment with its bread 
ration These ovens were manufactured at Tampa at 24 hours 
notice and were readily  set up underground in the field 
The following is the description of the ovens and the method 
of using them as given in the Manual referred to 
The body of each oven is made of two pieces of A inch sheet iron sheet 
steel These sheets are 3 feet long by 2 feet 6 inches wide and so curved 
tiat when their upper edges are connected and the lower edges fixed in 
e ground they form an arch the span of which is 3 feet 9 inches and 
the rise I foot 4 inches The lower edge of each sheet is bent outwards 
into a flange so as to secure a flrm rest on the ground On the inside of 
each sheet are riveted three longitudinal bars I inch wide and h iiAh 
thick and on the outside five transverse ribs It inch wide by 1 in 
thick The upper ends of the transverse ribs on one of the sheets are 
formed into hooks and those other sheets into eyes by means of which 
the sheets are securely attached to each other along the ridge of the oven 
when erected The front of the oven is closed by a sheet iron or steel 
door with a handle When the soil is of clay or of other favourable 
quality the rear end of the oven may be closed by the natural earth but 
if it is sandy or loose a sheetiron plate will be required to close it No 
chimney is necessary When set up the whole excepting the door is 
covered with a mass of earth 8 inches in thickness 
The depth of the earth is named for the reason that a larger quantity 
would be liable from its weight to bend the iron when heated and a 
smaller quantity would allow too much heat to escape An excavation 
3 or 4 feet in depth should be made a foot or two from the dodr for the 
convenience of the baker Two hours are required for heating the oven 
at first starting but for each heating immediately followingf one hour will 
be sufficient A small quantity of wood is placed in the oven at the 
extreme rear and igmted the door being kept open to afford a 
draught and a vent for the smoke Small quantities of wood 
shouid then be added as combustion progresses In this was 
the fuel will burn more freelyand the oven be heated quickerthan if 
all the fuel necessary for the heating were put in at once As soon as the 
oven is at a white heat the ashes should be raked out the floor swept 
clean or the sheetiron floor put in and the dough in pans introduced 
The time required for each baking is about fortyfive minutes The oven 
can be erected and prepared for use in fifteen minutes and if kept in con 
stant opemtion for twentyfour hours can bake sufficient bread for Iooo 
men By the use of two of these ovens therefore a regiment of Iooo 
men if it make a halt of fourteen hours hours each day can be supplied 
with fresh bread daily on the line of march Ordinary kneading troughs 
can be made and placed on trestles or they may be fixed on the ground 
and trenches excavated near them for the kneaders to stand in 
Compressed yeast may be used under ordinary circum 
stances but it should be kept on ice The rising with this 
yeast will take from four to six hours It is more practicable 
however for troops going into Cuba to make use of a dry 
yeast yeast foam yeast powder that is guaranteed not to 
deteriorate for three months from time of manufacture The 
rising process with the dry yeast will consume eight or ten 
hours A hospital tent should be allowed for a bakery and 
two men from the fighting force can well be spared as baiers
