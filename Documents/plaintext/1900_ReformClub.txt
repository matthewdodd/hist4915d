SURG ONS AT THE REFORM 
CLUBUfeS 
II2S 
Dr Tinker Hyde consented to move the resolution as an 
amendment  and this was seconded by Mr George Jackson 
who was in favour of it because he objected to the principle 
that a practitioner should have as many votes as qualifica 
tions  the true principle he thought was one man one vote 
The amendment on being put to the vote was lost and the 
resolution carried 
At the afternoon session in the absence of the Chairman 
Dr Hime took the chair and Mr R B Anderson read a paper 
on A Medical Polity  Corporate and Medical Reform 
The Midwife Question 
Dr Cox in introducing his resolution 
That this Conference protests against any legislation that will have the 
effect of giving a legal status to midwives as a class 
said that he meant to object to the principle of registering 
midwives as midwifery practitioners He had been told it 
was now too late but none the less he brought that resolution 
forward The opinion of the profession had been repeatedly 
shown to be opposed to this legislation It was bad for the 
public and he thought the profession should honestly express 
their opinion on the subject and if in spite of that the public 
chose to insist on this legislation the harm that was likely to 
follow would be at the door of the public He did not think it 
necessary to give reasons why the registration of midwives 
would be so harmful to the public as he thought the delegates 
there must know as well as he did what they were 
Dr Dolan seconded the resolution and a discussion ensued 
in which Drs Whittaker Woodcock Ritchie Nash 
Langley Browne Rees and RatcliffGaylard opposed the 
resolution 
Mr Victor Horsley also spoke against the sweeping 
character of Dr Coxs resolution and said that if the Con 
ferece adopted it it would practically put the other resolu 
tions on the subject that followed out of order 
Dr Major Greenwood asked Dr Cox if by his resolution 
he objected to any legal status being givenas for instance 
thai of an obstetrical nurse He asked this question as Dr 
Ritchie had said that any control given by legislation implied 
a legal status and it could hardly be said that no control was 
admif sble 
Mr Anderson Dr Helme Dr Broadbent and Dr Brassey 
Brier ley agreed with the resolution 
Dr Cox in answer said he did not mean by his resolution 
that all control was inadmissible but that there should be no 
legislation to recognise them as practitioners of midwifery 
Because they existed it was not necessary for the profession to 
upport them any more than it was necessary for them to try 
to exterminate them The only extermination that could be 
brought about would be by educating the public to see the 
wisdom of not employing them 
The resolution was put by the Chairman and was carried 
19 voting for the resolution and 16 against 
The Chairman then ruled that the resolutions dealing with 
midwife legislation put down by Dr Owen Morris Birken 
head and Dr RatcliffGaylard were now out of order and could 
not be considered 
Medical Education 
Dr Stewart Manchester then moved  
That while appreciating the action of the General Medical Council in 
raising the standard of preliminary education this Conference is of 
opinion that a still higher standard would further raise the status of 
the profession collectively and individually and promote the public wel 
fare 
This was seconded by Dr Wilkinson and after some dis 
cussion was carried 
Dr Crawshaw then moved  
That it is desirable that every medical student should subsequently to 
the date of his passing the examination in anatomy physiology and 
materia medica be compelled to spend as part of his curriculum twelve 
months with a general practitioner 
The mover said that the recent action of the General 
Medical Council in disapproving of unqualified assistants 
had become a means of depriving students of a certain kind 
of practical knowledge It might be that that knowledge was 
not of a scientific character but it was of a necessary kind 
and such as he could not get at the hospital It should be 
limited to twelve months and the pupil should be protected 
irom having too much to do 
Dr George Jackson seconded the resolution but he said 
he only approved of it sub modo 
Dr Rees objected to it 
Dr Woodcock said it was really a return to the old unquali 
fied assistants 
After some discussion the resolution was put to the vote 
and lost by a considerable majority 
There were present at the Conference 33 delegates At 
different times during the day about a dozen practitioners 
attended as spectators of the proceedings 
SIR WILLIAM MAC CORMAC AND MR TREVES 
AT THE REFORM CLUB 
The Reform Club gave a dinner on April 28th to Sir William 
Mac Cor mac and Mr Frederick Trves both of whom are 
members of the club in recognition of their conspicuous 
services to the wounded in South Africa The Earl of 
Rosebery presided and amongst the company which 
exceeded 100 in number were Lord Russell of Killowen 
Lord Burghclere Sir H Fowler MP Mr H Glad 
stone MP Sir N Lockyer Dr Farquharson MP 
Dr Stephen Mackenzie Mr Malcolm Morris Dr Mapother 
Sir C Nixon and several other medical members of the 
Club 
After giving The Queen Lord Rosebery proposed the 
toast of the evening 
 Sir William Mac Cormac and Mr 
Trves He said that in a war in which there had been such 
diversity of opinion there had been unanimity only on one point 
and enthusiastic unanimitythat the medical and hospital 
service had been practically perfect The Government had 
been able to obtain the men and give the supplies which these 
men had used The Government sent for the two most 
eminent men they could think of and the Government gave 
them a free hand All honour to the Government and all 
honour to the men Without a second thought they left their 
great connections in this country and went out for six months 
to take a share in the hospital and surgical work for the army 
Their names needed no mention from him Sir William 
MacCormacs name was a household word He had been 
for four successive years chosen President of the 
College of Surgeons an honour he believed almost 
unprecedented if not unique In the FrancoPrussian 
war in the bloody and thunderous scene at Sedan 
Sir William Mac Cormac was continuously carrying on 
surgical operations He had brought his experience and skill 
to bear upon our war and soldiers in their turn Mr Trves 
too had left a great practice and applied his unrivalled sur 
gical skill in the same way His name was a household word 
among them and he need not expatiate upon it But he had 
seen it stated in a paper that he was about to enter Parlia 
ment It was stated that he had been consulted about it 
and that he had said he would rather enter the grave He 
trusted that if this was authentic he would take the oppor 
tunity to explain it Lord Rosebery concluded by saying 
that they were not merely honouring two eminent men 
and two fellowmembers of the Reform Club they 
I were not merely honouring a consummate act of patriotism 
on their part but they were paying honour to the noncom 
batant members of the army They were glad to see that 
one Major Babtie received the other day the Victoria Cross 
He was not sure that the noncombatant members of the 
army had received their fair share of the Victoria Cross 
Their heroism was not less than the heroism of those engaged 
in forlorn hopes and they had shown that they were 
as incapable of fear as much as the soldiers whom they 
tend 
Sir W Mac Cormac in reply after returning thanks for the 
I honour done him said he went out to South Africa with some 
reluctance he might now admit but deemed it right to go 
I from a sense of duty Our soldiers had fought under condi 
tions which might well dissuade the bravest in a country of 
I appalling difficulties advancing in the open against an un 
I seen enemy who poured a pitiless hail of bullets into them 
I like rain and who themselves were practically unseen and 
I safe from our assault To illustrate this he referred to the

battle of Colenso On that day we had some 1140 casualties 
We all believed rightly or wrongly that Boer statements on 
the subject of their losses were not very trustworthy He 
Had had an opportunity of learning he thought on good 
authority what the Boer losses were on that occasion He 
heard from the other side from the German officers who were 
there watching the methods of Boer warfare and the state 
ment was subsequently most positively confirmed by the 
Free State Secretary Mr Fischer with whom he had several 
conversations that the total loss of the Boers on that day was 
5 killed and 25 wounded  and this he thought might well be 
true for our people never caught sight of a Boer the whole day 
Commandant Albrecht the Boer artillery captain calculated 
that 12 Boers were killed and 40 wounded for every 1000 fired 
of our shells The comparative want of gravity in the wounds 
inflicted by the Mauser bullet was very remarkable Men 
recovered after being shot through every part of the body and 
96 per cent of those treated in the base hospitals recovered 
from their injuries Another very remarkable fact was the 
fewness of the amputations performed During the first four 
months of the war only twenty amputations were performed 
at the No 1 General Hospital at Wynberg Our LeeMetford 
projectile inflicted a very similar kind of wound but the Boer 
wounded were not so well treated as ours were The Boers 
did not possess as our troops did a first field dressing whose 
speedy application doubtless saved much life and suffering 
During his stay in South Africa he had an opportunity 
of examining the medical arrangements both throughout 
the Cape Colony and Natal and he did not himself 
believe it would be possibleand he was able to con 
trast what he had seen with his experience of former 
warsto have anything more complete or better arranged 
On the part of the Government authorities there was nothing 
that was suggested nothing that money could purchase that 
was not forthcoming when and where it was wanted The 
supply of medical requirements was lavish and what was 
above all praiseworthy these enormous supplies did not re 
main heaped up at Capetown Durban or Port Elizabeth but 
were distributed to the various hospitals over many hundreds 
of miles of country In spite of all the difficulties of provision 
ing such a large army so many miles from their base he found 
that wherever he might be the soldier received a daily 
supply of fresh meat and bread and that therefore except 
perhaps during the actual hours of fighting the hardships ex 
perienced by our men in the matter of commissariat might be 
counted as not worth mentioning Officers and men received 
the same supplies and his own actual experience proved on 
many occasions the excellence of these commodities After 
referring to the good effects of the war in uniting the Colonies 
to the Mother Country he said of the medical arrangements 
that they were better than they had ever been before Of the 
medical officers it might be said that they had shown them 
selves tobe without fear as most certainly they were without 
reproach 
Mr Trves endorsed what Sir William Mac Cormac had 
said about the treatment of the sick in South Africa It was 
perfectly true that there had never been a campaign in which 
the horrors of war had been so mitigated and where the treat 
ment of wounded had been so complete His lot was cast 
with the field hospital which followed the Ladysmith relief 
column from beginning to end He was present at every 
engagement from the battle of Colenso to the relief of Lady 
smith and their hospital small as it was received the 
wounded during the whole of the Natal campaign with the 
exception of the slight cases After one nights battle Spion 
Kop 715 wounded were put into the hospital camp One 
afternoon they had orders to clear the camp of wounded 
before sunrise next day and men were borne on 150 stretchers 
by hand to Frere twentysix miles a thing which he believed 
had never been done in a campaign before The medical 
men serving in the war owed much to General Buller who 
took a remarkable interest in the surgical necessities of the 
campaign and showed great anxiety about the accommodation 
of the sick and wounded During the time he himself was 
at the seat of war he saw much of the common soldier 
He was struck not only with the patriotism and admirable 
pluck of these men but with their almost feminine kindness 
to each other and their extreme unselfishness So far as the 
fiick were concerned there were two plagues in South Africa  
the plague of flies and the plague of women The flies could 
be got rid of by means of horsehair wisps gauze and other 
appliances and the flies disappeared at night But the women 
mentioned in Sir Alfred Milners proclamation were absolutely 
a terror They came out in the guise of amateur nurses having 
exhausted every other form of excitement  they took up the 
time of the officers and in fact had the camp to themselves 
Considering the kind of war in which we were engaged and the 
number of lives lost the picture of a number of elaborately 
dressed ladies masquerading in summer toilets and arranging 
picnics about Capetown was a blot on the campaign 
The Lord Chief Justice proposed the health of The 
Chairman and Lord Rosebery in responding said Mr 
Trves forgot to rise to the fly he threw over him about enter 
ing Parliament He was inclined to think it was from a 
merciful consciousness that if he did choose to enter Parlia 
ment he would cut out most of the leaders in rhetoric that 
adorned those two chambers 
THE EFFECT OF SMALL DOSES OF ALCOHOL ON 
THE BRAIN 
The second Lees and Raper Memorial Lecture was delivered 
by Mr Victor Horsley FRS on April 27th at St James Hall 
The chair was taken by Mr Augustine Birrell QC MP 
who after the Hon Secretary of the Lees and Raper Memorial 
Fund had stated the facts concerning the inauguration of 
these lectures said that they were met to hear Mr Horsley 
who was known asa fearless investigator of truth and the 
I servant of science 
 
He was a great authority on the brain 
and what the country now wanted more than anything else 
in the supreme councils of the nation on the battlefield in 
literature and philosophy was brains  and if Mr Horsley 
could tell them anything as to how they were to maintain the 
little brain they had got and how they could increase that 
store his services would be in demand not only by the tem 
perance party but by every political literary scientific 
philosophic and religious agency which existed in the 
country at the present time 
Selective Action of Alcohol 
Mr Horsley said that it was his duty to present to them from 
the scientific standpoint a plain statement of the present state 
of knowledge as to the effect produced on the brain by small 
doses of alcohol It probably was not generally known that 
all drugs had a selective action on the organs and tissues of 
the body that is to say they affected by reason of their 
chemical affinity some organs or parts of organs and spared 
others and this was particularly true of alcohol As Professor 
Ehrlich had pointed out it was merely a question of chemical 
affinity They must therefore first familiarise themselves 
with the various elements of the nervous system which in 
vestigation had shown te be the commonest point of attack 
The speaker proceeded to give a rapid survey of the central 
nervous system illustrating the subject by means of lantern 
slides In considering the effect of small quantities of alcohol 
on the central nervous system it was necessary to discuss its 
effect on ideation that is the intellectual thinking apparatus 
next on the voluntary action apparatus and then on the qere 
bellar apparatus for the regulation of movement and equilibra 
tion The activity of the highest psychical centres of the 
brain was estimated in various ways The activity of the 
brain in executing the decision of a thought arising from the 
stimulation of a special sense centre could be estimated 
either by measuring the time the brain took to do some small 
task allotted to it first in the natural state and secondly when 
under the influence of alcohol or by estimating the amount 
of workfdone in a given time 
Increased Reaction Times 
The time occupied by the nervous system in observing and 
recording the simplest thing was called 
 
the reaction time 
and was so appreciable that in all minute and accurate records 
astronomers had to measure their reaction period and to 
account for it The lecturer then demonstrated by an experi 
ment the method of measuring the reaction time This plan 
in all forms and varieties had been very largely employed by 
I Professor Kraepelinwhose investigations had been so thorough
