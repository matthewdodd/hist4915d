READERs of the interesting series of letters from Mr Treves 
which have been published during the last tbree months in 
the BRTIS3 MBDIOAL JOURNAL will be pleased to see the 
accompanying photographs taken by Mir qTreves of the 
hospital with which he worked They give a very good idea of 
the difficulties of transport and of the rough and ready condi 
tions under which the surgical work had to be done

  Ar TrvssW LA the foregrou 
The hospital was No 4 Stationary Hospital but the term 
 stationary  must be undiratood in a Piekwikkian sense for 
the hospital was in fact not stationary but mobile However 
it was not technically a field hospital although at the 
battle of Colenso and during the fighting about Spion 
KoD its officers manaced to get it un not verv far from 
the fighting line Major Kirkpatrick ItAMC 
was the officer in charge and the other officers 
were at first Major Mallins and Lieutenant Sim 
son On December ith igoo it was established 
at Frere a station on the line from Maritzburg 
to Ladyamith a few miles south of Chieveley and 
Mr Trevees with his two nurses Miss MeCaul 
and Miss Tarr went up with the hospital A 
day or two afterwards the nursing staff received 
a valuable reinforcement in the person of two 
sisters of the Army Nursing Service The 
general appearance of the hospital camp is seen 
in the first photograph Fig i which shows 
both the large marquees and the small bell 
tents in one of whichthat in the foreground 
Mr Treves was established The army moved 
off from Frere Camp on December 13th and 
early on December isth the day of the first 
unsuccessful attempt to force the passage of the 
Tugela at Colenso No 4 Stationary Hospital was 
ordered to move up with all speed to Chieveley 
where it was established about three and three 
quarter miles from Naval Hill wbere the British 
big guns were firing There it remained for that 
day and until December 17th when a retirement 
to b rere was rendered necessary by the fact that 
the camp at Chieveley was within reach of the 
Boer shells During these two days an enormous 
amount of work was done by the staff of 
the hospital which Mr Treves rejoined on the evening 
of the day of battle December 15th after a heavy 
afternoons work with the field hospitals established im 
mediately behind Naval Hill and under its shelter The 
tent in which all the operations were done is seen in 
another photograph Fig 3 which shows the improvised 
operating table of biscuit boxes When it is remembered 
that the temperature in the shade on December 15th and 16th 
was I0 F and on December i8th io49 F and that at Chieve 
ley water was scarce it will be understood that these were 
very trying days both for the wounded and their surgeons and 
nurses Mr Treves pays awarm tribute to the patient courage 
of the wounded to the excellentwork done by the RAMC 
officers and to the devotion and cheerful endurance of the 
four nursing sisters and it does not 
require much reading between the lines 
of his graphic letters to perceive that 
Mr Treves spared himself not at all 
but worked as hard and cheerfully as 
anybody 
at Frere the hospital remained gradu 
ally passing on its wounded to the base 
hospitals at Pietermaritzburg or to the 
hospital ships in Durban harbour but 
filling their places with cases of 
dysentery and typhoid fever until 
January 13th Jgoo when the order to 
move to Springfield on the Lesser 
Tugela i8 miles away to the west 
was received Colonel Gallwey CB 
RAMC the Principal Medical Officer 
with General Buller had determined 
that the hospital should follow the 
troops and had enlarged it to 300 
beds This involved the transportation 
of 6o tents and io marquees in i6 
waggons each drawn by i6 oxen with 
nearly Ioo more oxen for water carts 
bread carts and so on There were in 
addition 5 ambulances each drawn by 
Io mules and Mr Trevess own Scotch 
cart with I6 mules with which he had 
hben liberallv nrovidpd bv thA PMO 
Iso as to be able to move indepezidently to any point where 
Ihis services might be most required Lastly there were 
the saddle horses for the medical officers whose numbere 
had now been raised to 12 The camp wae awake at 
3 AM the tents were struck by 4 AM and the huge

of the minor difficulties which attend transport in a country 
where every stream is as it were sunk in a deep trench with 
precipitous sides 
On January i8th the hospital moved on six miles to the 
Great Tugela and the tents were pitched under Mount Alice 
where the big naval guns were placed not far from Spear 
mans Hill On January 23rd the day before Spion Krp 
orders were suddenly received to increase the hospital by ioo 
bell tents which meant being ready for 500 more patients or

Soo altogether although no increase of the staff was possible 
The tents were ready however by the next day and on 
January 25th the wounded began to pour in until late at 
night carried by the Volunteer Ambulance Corps organised 
by Colonel Galwey and the coolie bearers Some 300 
wounded were at once sent on the 25 miles to Frere but the 
hospital that night contained some 6cc others Additionis later 
brought up the total which the hospital bad to accommodate 
to about 700 Altogether the hospital stayel three weeks at

the camp near Spearmarid Hill and dealt with over i ooo 
wounded in that time The army began to retire on Februatry 
8th and when on the next day the order came to the 
hospital to move there were still about 150 serious cases 
undter treatment These were all carried by hand on 
stretchers acrosis the veld 25 miles to the railway at Frere 
By transporting the woudnded in this way instead of in the 
ambulance waggons which are of a clumsy pattern made 
strong to go anywhere much suffering was prevented and in 
Mr Trevess opinion many lives and limbs saved 
At Frere wlhich was reached on February i ith the wounded 
were again placed in the hospital and as soon as possible 
moved on by train to Mooi River Base Hospital or 
to the hospital ships at Durban These trains were 
improvised by Major BrazierCreagh RAMC who did 
wonders with the material at his disposal Unfortunately 
the carriages had no through communication and it was 
difficult to arrange their conversion However by hard 
work and the expenditure of much energy and ingenuity 
Major BrazierCreagh overcame all superable obstacles and 
made the best of insuperable defects Fig 2 iS from Mr 
Trevess photograph of one of these trains and shows the 
bearers at work getting the wounded into the carriages 
Through the windows the white bed linen of the upper tier of 
beds can be seen It was part of the general unpreparedness 
that there were no hospital trains in Natal This defect has 
recently been repaired by the arrival of the Princess Christian 
Hospital train built for the Red Cross at Birmingbam and 
despatched to South Africa after the battle of Colenso was 
foughtnot a conspicuous example of the alleged superiority 
of voluntary effort over official methods The War Office has 
no train ready and does not prepare one the Red Cross has 
no train built but does set to work to build one one for three 
armies resting on three different lines of railway and man 
ages to get to work six months or thereabouts after the be 
ginning of the fighting 
WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE 
FROM AN OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT 
THE FIGHT INTO LADYSMITH 
To appreciate fully the magnitude of the task accomplished 
by the troops under Sir Redvers Buller one must bave seen 
the district around Colenso Opposite this village the Tugela 
is a broad and rapid river with steep and rugged banks 
which changes its course continually For months past it 
has been unfordable and the only bridges crossing it had 
been destroyed by the Boers On either side of the river are 
irregular ranges of hills which are divided by deep ravines 
into innumerable kopjes of every conceivable shape These 
vary in height from soo tO 2000 feet above the surrounding 
plain Many of them are almost perpendicular and 
most of them are thickly covered by dense mimosa 
scrub and huge boulders so that an army corps 
could be hidden amongst them without a man being 
visible Each kopje bristled with strong and deep 
trenches so skilfully constructed that as each one was 
captured it was exposed to a withering fire from all sides 
To add to our difficulties the plain between Colenso and 
Ladysmith is studded with kopjes which completely com 
mand both the road and the railway The seeming impossi 
bility of the task might well have caused even the bravest 
troops to hesitate and it was only after four stubborn attacks 
which extended over a period of 28 days hard fighting that 
the position was finally carried 
The strain which this entailed on our troops can only be 
realised by those who were present Imagine an attack 
which lasted continuously for x7 days as did the final one on 
the Boer position During the whole of that time the troops 
slept on the hillsides amidst thunder storms and rain with 
not even a great coat to cover them No words can do justice 
to their courage heroism fortitude and cheerfulness under 
all the hardships and privations to which they were exposed 
Ladysmith the goal of all our hopes during so many long 
and weary days may be described as a town in corrugated 
zinc situated in an oasis of palms and eucalyptus trees 
Stretching away to eastward of the town is a large circular 
plain some six miles in diameter On the southeast margin 
of theplainrises UmbulwanaHill Exceptto eastwardthetown 
is surrounded by barren stoneclad hills prominent amongst 
them being the famous Wagon Hill with Casars Camp 
to the south Whilst wandering through Ladysmith one is 
forcibly struck by its wonderful state of preservation An 
angle knocked off the clock tower of the Town Hall another off 
the porch of the Roman Catholic chapel and an occasional 
circular hole through some stray house is all that remains to
