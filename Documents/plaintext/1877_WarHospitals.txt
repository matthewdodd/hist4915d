herself in these terms   
How can I help it  We have been vac 
cinated together This American eccentricity calls to mind the custom 
which was very general in the great houses of England during the first 
part of the century and which consisted in setting aside in order to 
break the monotony of amusement a day for general purgation 
Hosts guests and servants all took part Saturday evening was 
usually fixed for the purpose The physician of the chateau came and 
left with each one in his chamber a contingent of pills and on the 
Sunday the whole household were satisfied It was a form of public 
medication which exactly resembles the present practice in America of 
social vaccination 
WAR HOSPITALS 
Dr Guy in a work upon War in its Sanitary Aspects proceeds to 
prove as facts especially applicable in the conduct of the present war 
that extempore hospitals of the rudest kind and even the roughest 
shelter from the weather that can be found or created are immea 
surably preferable to the best existing structures adapted at whatever 
cost to the reception of the sick and wounded He says that in 1758 
in consequence of an unprosperous attack made by England on France 
many sick soldiers were lodged near Newport Isle of Wight in old 
houses and barns In one close hovel a soldier of the 63rd Regiment 
just landed from a transport was placed On the third day a malig 
nant sorethroat carried him off The sheets were changed and 
another man put in the bed  he died in the same way  and a third 
man shared his fate Fresh bedding was ordered  the boards were 
scraped and thoroughly washed with vinegar  and then a fourth soldier 
was lodged in this hovel and died Purification was resorted to 
a second time vinegar fumes burnt gunpowder and burnt resins 
being the purifying agents adopted  but in spite of all this the fifth 
man lodged there had a narrow escape for his life The place was 
not used again for seven or eight days after which the sixth man was 
put in it  he too caught the disease and was saved with difficulty 
This sad experience was a sharp lesson The necessities of the war 
required that accommodation in addition to that existing around New 
port should be provided A temporary shed of deal boards thatched 
with a coat of new straw sufficiently thick to keep out wind and rain 
was built at a cost of 40 It was large enough for one hundred and 
twenty patients Dr Brocklesby the physician in charge thus 
speaks of its efficacy   
Although the hovel was finished in a fashion 
the most slovenly and apparently inadequate to the end proposed 
upon trial it was found that notwithstanding much extraordinary cold 
as well as moisture which the sick there lodged had suffered remark 
ably fewer died of the same diseases though treated with the same 
medicines and the same general regimen than died anywhere else  
and all the convalescents recovered much sooner than they did in any 
of the warmer and closer huts and barns hired round Newport where 
fires and apparently better accommodation of every kind could be pro 
vided for them A fact so striking must of necessity attain notoriety 
Mr Adair Inspector of Regimental Infirmaries was in the neighbour 
hood at the time and observing that the constant influx of fresh air 
was beneficial in so marked a degree to the men hutted in the forest 
obtained an order to convert Carisbrooke Castle into a general hospital 
for the accommodation of four hundred sick There it was thought 
the patients would progress more favourably than their comrades 
lodged in the miserable huts of the town or than those upon the wide 
bare forest near Newport under the 
 
occasional hovel as the extem 
pore hospital was slightingly designated but that had more import 
ance than was first conceived for although the castle was more 
prosperous to the recovery of the patients than the lowroofed houses 
a proportionally larger number of foresters were recovered and 
that in a shorter space of time This proved that whatever the injury 
might be resulting to the men from cold or redundant moisture it was 
small in comparison to the mischief complicated on the sick by huddling 
together three or four hundred men under one roof and in outhouses 
adjoining the castle Two years later Dr Brocklesby had further 
experience of the utility of extemporised hospitals Putrid fever of a 
very dangerous class appeared in 1760 amongst the sick of the 30th 
Regiment at Guildford in Surrey for the treatment of which he erected 
other hospitals at a cost of 10 each with a result the most satisfac 
tory Dr Guy tells us that in September 1760 numbers in the 
regiment last named and others were daily falling sick of putrid pete 
chial fevers where the infirmaries were overcrowded Dr Brocklesby 
obtained plenary powers from General Cornwallis to act He selected 
the driest and most airy spot on a rising ground in a field behind the 
camp removed as much of the dry sandy soil as he required and near the 
edge of the excavation drove in upright stakes about six feet high from 
the surface placing wattles between them and coated the outside with 
new straw Rafters were laid over and received a thick coating simi 
lar to that placed on the sides making the hollow spacious and airy 
overhead and yet quite warm and dry A hospital for forty patients 
so constructed could not have cost more than 20 Of the patients 
we are told that although several were admitted suffering from a true 
petechial jailfever only one or two at most died This happy result 
was ascribed by Dr Brocklesby more to the benefit of a pure keen air 
breathed by the patients than to all the medicines they took The 
nature of the soil permitted the removal when necessary of the 
whole inner surface of the floors and walls which might be suspected 
to imbibe any infectious matter proceeding from the patients  and the 
sand so scraped off was thrown out of doors In 176162 an oppor 
tunity occurred to Dr Brocklesby to improve on the experience he 
had gained There was a great amount of sickness in a militia camp 
at Winchester He dug three pits in the chalk thirtyone feet long 
nineteen wide and five deep At a foot from the edge of these pits 
he drove stakes six feet apart His walls and roof were formed of the 
same materials  the arrangements were completed by the construction 
of a brick chimney and the fastening of a board along the line of the 
mens heads For windows and ventilating apertures airholes were 
made in the thatch to be opened and closed at will  and ingress was 
made by means of steps cut in the chalk To those three mansions 
for the sick the fevercases from the close infirmary at Winchester as 
well as from the camp were removed In less than two weeks the 
numbers were reduced in the proportion of four to one  the number 
of sick to the end of the campaign was much fewer than ever be 
fore and with the exception of three at the most all the men ad 
mitted were cured The same plan was adopted on the chalky soil of 
a different encampment a large airy porch being placed before each 
door A regiment encamped there lost not a man during the whole 
encampment In some other regiments in which prejudices against 
the above plan existed several of the sick died Dr Guy concludes 
by stating that he had recounted these experiences with cheap extem 
porised hospitals as equally applicable to war and peace and as bear 
ing directly on one of the most important hygienic questions of the 
day  and that the facts given were quite in harmony with Sir George 
Bakers interesting narrative of the outbreak of smallpox at Bland 
ford when patients in natural smallpox fared better under hedges and 
dry arches than those who had been inoculated did in their own dwell

ARMY MEDICAL RETIREMENT 
Commenting upon the promotion and retirement scheme the Army 
and Navy Gazette says The inducements to retire are really most 
liberal We may ask why are not military surgeons treated with 
equal liberality To allow of combatant officers receiving a more 
liberal rate of retirement a supplementary estimate of 60000 is re 
quired Not one of the improvements made in the medical department 
have cost the Government a penny Within the last few years some 
240 medical officers have been absorbed whose duties in addition to 
the recruiting for the reserve forces have fallen upon those who re 
main The sum saved by this reduction of establishment in the shape 
of pay allowances travelling expenses etc can be little short of 
8oooo Some portion of this in fairness should go in increased in
