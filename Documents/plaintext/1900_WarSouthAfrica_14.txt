JAN 20 1900I THE BATTLE OF COLENSO lTD BsaL J 6A 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE BATTLE OF COLENSO 
FROM A CORRESPONDENT IN NATAL 
THE PLAN OF THE ATTACK 
AT the battle of Colenso which was fought on December Isth 
1899 there were roughly about 20000 British troops engaged 
These included about I6ooo infantry 3000 cavalry and 
artillery and some iooo irregular cavairy The plan of 
attack was that the Fifth Brigade under General Fitzroy 
Hart should force its way across the Tugela river and try to 
turn the right flank of the enemy At the same time General 
Bartons Brigade was to endeavour to cross the river further 
down and to seize a steep hill on the left flank from which 
they could enfilade the Boer lines General Hildyards Brigade 
were to make a froat attack on the position whilst General 
Lytteltons was held in reserve 
The Boers were strongly entrenched amongst the steep 
kopjes around Colenso the centre of the position being Fort 
Wylie which stands just behind the village of Colenso 
The battle was begun at 535 AM by a shell from one of the 
naval guns This was immediately followed by a terrific fire 
from our guns which was maintained throughout the action 
At times Fort Wylie appeared as an actual sheet of fire from 
the bursting of our shells The Boer artillery fire was com 
paratively ineffective and many of their shells failed to burst 
Their musketry fire was reserved until our infantry were little 
more than 500 yards from their position when they were 
assailed by a perfect tempest of bullets The Fifth Brigade 
under General Hart being most exposed to the fire suffered 
severely 
NATURE OF WOUNDS 
The Fifth Brigade Field Hospital under the command of 
Major G H Younge R AMC had quickly 24 officers and 285 
noncommissioned officers and men admitted with bullet 
wounds The following analysis of these wounds according 
to the region involved is interesting Head I9 face 7 neck 3 
back and spine 20 upper extremity 76 lower extremity i I8 
other wounds 6 
From this it will be seen that wounds of the lower extremity 
greatly predominated Of the 309 only 8 were returned 
as shell wounds the remainder were without ex 
ception caused by Mauser bullets The wounds caused 
by these bullets were humane in the extreme The 
wounds both of entrance and of exit were small 
and presented a clean punchedout appearance being 
almost entirely free from contusion or laceration Amongst 
the cases brought to hospital haemorrhage was conspicuous by 
its absence 
In Major Younges field hospital only 4 cases of gunshot 
fracture were admittedi of the femur I of the humerus 
and 2 of both bones of the leg In none of these were the 
bones extensively comminuted and it is more than probable 
that all 4 cases will recover with useful limbs 
Many of the wounds were curious and interesting One 
man presented symmetrical Mauser bullet wounds one inch 
below the centre of each clavicle Both bullets passed directly 
backwards but no wounds of exit could be found In another 
case a man was struck whilst lying down The bullet entered 
near the centre of the parietal bone passed downwards and 
forwards through the brain the orbit and the hard palate 
and was found projecting beneath the skin behind the 
symphysis menti from which region it was removed without 
difficulty by Major F T Wilkinson RAMC There was 
extensive effusion of blood within the orbit which caused 
marked protrusion of the eye and lids The patient was per 
fectly conscious could give an accurate account of how he was 
wounded and on the following morning was able to walk 
without Aifficulty to the stretcher on which he was carried to 
the hospitaltrain 
TREATMENT IN THE FIELD HOSPITALS 
In only a few cases was it found necessary to perform opera 
tions in the field hospitals As the cases arrived the wounds 
were washed with perchloride lotion and dressed with double 
cyanide wool and gauze Long before night fell the whole of 
the wounded exceeding 6oo in number were comfortably 
lodged in the field hospitals 
On the day following the battle the wounded were trans 
ferred to the stationary and base hospitals with a celerity 
which was absolutely marvellous In effecting the transfer 
the greatest assistance was given by the Volunteer Ambu 
lance Corps of iooo men which was organised at Maritzburg 
by Colonel T J Gallwey CB RAMC 
THE CONDUCT OF THE RAMC UNDER FIRE 
During the action many acts of heroism were performed by 
both officers and men of the RAMC Conspicuous amongst 
these was that of MajorW Babtie CMG CAMC who 
rode through a tempest of bullets to succour a number of men 
of the Royal Artillery who lay wounded and exposed to the 
enemys fire Wherever the fire was hottest there were to be 
found medical officers attending to and dressing the wounded 
with as much coolness and skill as if they were in the wards 
of a hospital 
In all I saw 3 cases which were brought to the field hospital 
without dressings and in almost every case the dressings were 
applied with a neatness and precision which would have done 
credit to any hospital The rapidity with which the wounded 
were dressed and removed from the field by the bearer com 
panies was the subject of favourable comment on all sides 
The ambulances were several times fired on by the enemys 
guns and several of them were damaged by fragments of 
shell yet the medical officers worked steadily on with a devo 
tion and heroism which was beyond all praise 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNNER 
IX 
HEALTH OF LADYSMITH 
THE thrilling news of the splendid defence made by the 
garrison at Ladysmith at least shows that whatever condition 
a certain number of the garrison may be in the healthy and 
fighting men are as good as ever they were Nevertheless 
reports now make it certain that the epidemic of typhoid 
among the garrison is of a serious character Thus on 
January 8th and gth no fewer than I6 deaths from dysentery 
and typhoid were returned One correspondent writing 
early in December says that of his battalion of 550 go were 
down with typhoid fever In the face of this heavy 
mortality there is little doubt that the water supplies 
used by the troops have become contaminated Prob 
ably the heavy rains which invariably mean surface 
drainage into wells and streams have contributed to this 
contamination We can scarcely suppose that the latrines 
themselves are so placed as in any way to imperil the purity 
of the water supply At any rate from some cause or another 
it is evident that this pollution has occurred and in this con 
nection it is of interest to note that the troops are all supplied 
with filters For protection against typhoid filters cannot be 
relied upon under conditions of camp life The best remedy 
against an infected water supply is boiling the water and we 
fear very much that considerable difficulty may be experi 
enced in a camp in inducing soldiers to use this precaution 
but at the same time looking to the heavy losses now entailed 
it is certain that vigorous measures to enforce this practice 
wherever practicable should be used 
The British losses in the engagements on the 6th and 7th 
are fortunately smaller than we had been led to anticipate 13 
officers and 135 men are reported killed and 28 officers and 244 
men wounded Here the proportion of killed is unusually 
high and is doubtless due to the handtohand character of 
the fighting which occurred on Wagon Hill and elsewhere 
The Boer losses are stated differently in every report which 
reaches us so that it is impossible to arrive at any accurate 
information but we may rest assured that the forces engaged 
in attacking our positions must have lost very heavily 
ORANGE RIVER 
From the Orange River which may be taken as the base for 
the operations on the western border of the Free State it is 
interesting to learn that the health of the troops is thoroughly 
good and a Renter telegram of January 8th states that during 
the preEent lull in the fighting the hospitals there are almost 
empty All the serious Lcaes have been sent to the field hos

pitals at Wynberg Large quantities of medical comforts 
including mineral waters preserves fruits tobacco and 
furniture and clothing are stored in each of the hospitals and 
are much appreciated by the men who are keenly sensitive of 
the great kindness shown them by the donors The inhabit 
ants of Cradock a town on the Karoo forwarded over 200 
worth of goode for the sick and wounded This is satisfactory 
on every ground as there are a number of Dutch in the 
Cradock districts whose loyalty has sometimes been called in 
question 
PHYSIQUE OF THE YEOMANRY AND VOLUNTEERS 
One of the questions which has been raised in reference to 
the various yeomanry and volunteer corps now going to South 
Africa apart from their military qualifications for the work in 
hand is as to their physical fitness for the task before them 
On this ground I do not think much anxiety need be felt 
The climate of South Africa is on the whole healthy and 
invigorating and men accustomed to outdoor exercises 
such as are enjoyed by our town middle classes and 
yeomanry have all the qualifications for this outdoor life In 
many respects the volunteers and yeomanry now proceeding 
to South Africa will have the same qualities as the colonists 
who havebeen of such excellent service in the field although 
they cannot of course compare with the colonists in experi 
ence of the country and the peculiarities of South African 
life Nevertheless this knowledge will be gradually acquired 
by them and the yeomanry and volunteers will form excellent 
material out of which most valuable forces for warfare in 
South Africa will soon be made 
FIELD AMBULANCE FOR MOUNTED TROOPS 
In the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of January I3th is an 
interesting article by Dr Caverhill SurgeonMajor to the 
Lothians and Berwickshire Yeomanry Cavalry describing an 
ambulance scheme for the mounted service In this article 
the writer argues with considerable force that on tactical 
humanitarian and surgical grounds the bearer company with 
cavalry or mounted infantry should itself be mounted and 
that it should be provided with fittings for transporting men 
sitting or lying down either in a regular or improvised man 
ner and should have sufficient surgical appliances The 
special mobility and rapid movement of a cavalry force ob 
viously require equal facilities for movement in its surgical 
staff and bearer companies The flying hospital suggested 
by Dr Horace Manders is as stated in the JOURNAL of 
January i3th to consist of a hospital car and an ambulance 
car constructed on the principle of the Irish jaunting car 
each to be drawn by two horses attached to a pole on 
the same modification of the curricle principle as 
that adopted in the Cape cart The Cape cart is 
a hooded fourseated vehicle on two wheels Any 
wheeled ambulance which could be moved rapidly about the 
field and was capable of following the movements of cavalry 
must undoubtedly be of advantage and in many respects the 
proposed car is excellent At the same time I would point 
out that a long experience of driving over all sorts of roads 
and over the veld itself in South Africa has convinced me that 
no twowheeled vehicle in the world can compare for a moment 
in either comfort or safety with one having four wheels In 
driving over the veld at anything but a walk two dangers are 
constantly presenting themselves the ant heap and the ant 
bear hole Both of these occur over almost the whole of the 
South African veld and either of them is capable of readily 
upsetting a twowheeled vehicle It iaight be urged that a 
careful driver or postillion would naturally avoid both these 
obstacles But a man who whether as postillion or coachman 
is driving a vehicle across the veld has his attention con 
stantly distracted to some distant object In warfare I take 
it he would have to keep his eye to some extent upon the 
enemys lines In hunting of all sorts where the Cape cart is 
frequently used and in which I have had some experience of 
its use the drivers attention is constantly taken up by watch 
ing the troop of buck or other object of the chase and one of 
the wheels is very apt to run over an ant  heap or drop into 
the grasscovered and almost entirely concealed antbear 
hole without much warning In this way many capsizes occur 
On the other hand if a stronglybuilt fourwheeled American 
spider be used a capsize is almost impossible The 
Americans are a practical and ingenious people they have 
had the problem of the settlement of pathless tracts of country 
to deal with and I have no hesitation in saying that they 
have solved the question better than the South African Boers 
An old American engineer and pioneer once remarked to me 
on the subject of the Cape cart that it had fallen to his lot to 
travel in many countries and that he always went with an 
open mind prepared to discover that the peculiar institutions 
and appliances of various sorts adopted by any particular 
country had some special fitness for the purpose designed 
For a long time he had applied this principle to the Cape cart 
and racked his brains to discover its peculiar virtues and fit 
ness for the work required of it but he confessed finally that 
he had completely failed in this instance and that the prefer 
ence for a fourwheeled vehicle either in the shape of a buck 
board  spider or waggon over a rough and pathless country 
which obtains universally in America was undoubtedly 
rational The fourwheeled vehicle is invariably safer than a 
twowheeled and one wheel of an American  spider can be 
dropped into a hole or cross an ant heap or almost any other 
obstacle without absolutely capsizing the vehicle On these 
grounds I have no hesitation in saying that a spiderbuilt 
ambulance would be safer and more comfortable 
In conclusion I will merely add that personally I have 
twice been pitched out of a twowheeled vehicle in South 
Africa but never out of an American  spider which latter 
vehicle of later years I invariably used for all sorts of work 
SNAKES 
An article in the Spectator of January 13th contains the 
statement that among the casualties at Modder River were 
several cases of snakebite The snakes of South Africa it is 
added are both common and deadly cobras of all sizes pale 
yellow to black being the most active and dangerous One 
the Boers call the  Bpitting snake because they believe that 
it can spit the venom which oozes from its fangs I have not 
seen the reports of casualties from snakebite referred to 
although I admit that it is possible they may have occurred 
At the same time it must be pointed out that the number of 
deaths from snakebite in South Africa during a year are 
extremely small I have myself spent months on the veld 
and have been through a campaign yet during the whole of 
my South African experience I have only seen some three 
cases of snakebite ln the column in which I served through 
a campaign lasting some three months not a single instance 
of snakebite occurred in spite of the fact that the operations 
were conducted in the coast districts where snakes are 
most abundant The fact is that in South Africa the country 
is so bare that there is little cover for the snake which 
almost invariably makes for its hole on getting sight 
of man Snakes are fairly plentiful but they seldom 
attack unless trodden upon and they usually avoid being 
trodden upon by escaping in the manner described With 
regard to the spitting snake I can testify that this is 
no mere legend There is a small active snake which does 
squirt a poisonous fluid in this way and a case came under my 
notice in which a personal friend while stooping to pick up a 
stone with which to destroy one of these reptiles had this 
fluid squirted into his eye by such a snake a  ring hals 
Fortunately he was near a stream to which he rushed and in 
which he at once bathed the eye When I saw him the whole 
of the conjunctiva was acutely inflamed and remained in this 
condition for several days although the eye eventually ret 
turned to its normal condition 
THE RED CROSS ORGANISATION 
The need for a permanent central organisation for the con 
trol of voluntary relief was recognised by the formation early 
in 1899 under the auspices of Lord Lansdowne of the Central 
British Red Cross Committee under which the British Red 
Cross Society the St John Ambulance Brigade and other 
voluntary bodies are federated When the war broke out 
Colonel J S Young was sent out by the Central Committee 
to act as its Commissioner with instructions to make use of 
the ample funds and materials at his disposal as seemed best 
on the spot in cooperation with the Principal Medical Officer 
of the Field Force and with the local aid societies Lord 
Wantage who is chairman of the National Society for the Aid 
of Sick and Wounded in War has given some interesting de

tails of the work recently accomplished He refers to the 
excellent services rendered by Colonel Young who is work 
ing in touch with the Army Medical Service and with the 
local branch at Capetown under the auspices of Sir Alfred 
Milner He is also supplying warm clothing for invalids on 
their return journey 
The Society is engaged in equipping a convalescent home at 
the Cape for both officers and men a large extent of ground 
with suitable houses belonging to Sir James Sivewright has 
been generously placed by him at the disposal of the Society 
at Somerset West a beautiful and healthy site thirty miles 
from Capetown and eighteen from Wynberg with railway 
communication It can provide 200 beds which can easily be 
increased by huts or tents The Society is also establishing 
a convalescent hospital consisting of Doecker huts in the 
near vicinity of Netley Hospital The Society acts in con 
nection with the military medical authorities both at home 
and at the seat of war and thus forms the recognised 
channel for providing comforts etc for the sick and 
wouinded beyond what are supplied by the Army Medical Ser 
vice The Commissioner of the Red Cross Society has assured 
the executive at home that complete harmony exists between 
him and the officers of the Army Medical Service The 
promptness shown by them Lord Wantage adds in bringing 
the wounded down from the battefields to the hospitals at the 
base deserves the highest commendation Indeed the excel 
lence of the hospital field organisation in this campaign seems 
to be greatly in advance of that in any previous war 
One of Colonel Youngs letter from South Africa dated 
November 30th states that he had inspected the trains fitted 
up under the direction of Colonel Supple PMO These 
trains have been proved in the transport of the wounded from 
the engagements at Belmont and Graspan to be very efficient 
for the conveyance of the wounded over the long distances 
usual in the country He says 
One train carries 92 and the other 96 officers and men lying down in five 
carriages with passage down the centre all communicatling with one 
another and with carriages fitted one for carrying arms and kits one 
fitted as kitchen and pharmaey and a saloon carriage accommodating 
eight firstclass and 15 secondclass passengers two medical officers and 
two nursing sisters being provided for in this saloon with a portion of the 
other male attendants on the wounded 
The ventilation is admirable and I was only able to suggest the pro 
vision which I agreed to pay for of movable bed trays for the patients 
who could sit up to eat their food from I also provided an ice chest for 
one train at the request of Colonel Supple 
Furtheron Lord Wantage comments on the numerous applica 
tions for employment under the Red Cross which are made 
in many instances by fully qualified and trained nurses He 
points out that 4o qualified nurses were forced by the Boers to 
quit Johannesburg and are now in Capetown earnestly desiring 
to be employed Their case certainly seems a hard one and 
deserving of consideration should occasion arise for supple 
menting the navy or army nursing staff in South Africa 
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE NONCOMBATANT FICTION 
The following appeared in the Morniny Post of January 
12th  
RAMC 
It is most necessary here to say a word in praise of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps who faced a hot fire all day long 
going close up to the firing line to bring back our wounded 
It seems almost incredible that during the day five hundred 
wounded men should have been brought back by the Medical 
Corps though to get them back stretcher bearers and searchers 
had to cross and recross a zone of fire at least a mile wide 
War Correspondent of the Morning Post at Magersfontein 
He marches with the rest of us he swaggers all the way 
His step aint right but his boots is bright and he draws a soldiers pay 
He wears a kit of a perfect fit and his figure is just the one 
To go ahead when the ranks outspread anl the bayonets red on the 
gun  
But when its  Charge I he stays behindhe doesnt swarm no kop 
But dont you think that his morning drink is a basin o dribblin sop 
He doesnt shy when the shots whizz by nor he doesnt shake when a 
shell 
Splits over his head and his friend falls dead who was sound as a 
bloomin bell 
Look at the doctor I We dont lookat him 
Not till a bones disarranged in a limb 
What he is doingaint nothing to Us 
What he is thinking now who ares a cuss  
We must go fighting and he must stand still 
Bust all the doctors until a chaps ill 
But when our leg is broke in half and truth we must go sick 
He joins the strife with his long lean knife and cuts at the wounded 
quick 
His words are short but you cant pay court to one of a hundred such 
And we dont grouse when he wastes his nous on some of them groan 
ing Dutch 
0 his hand it kind o soothes the pain when the eyes see onlv red 
He stays behind but he stays to bind a regular splitting head 
And if we die of our scratches why it isnt his bloomin fault 
Who stays behind which is very kind while we carry the hot assault 
Go for the doctor and mind where you tread 
Tell him Im feeling that bad in my head 
Tell him the pills as Ive swallowed aint good 
Tell him Ive lost lots o flesh likewise blood 
Go for the doctor and tell him come quick 
Fetch up old Sawbones a Tommys gone sick 
In barracks morning stables done on Saturday he comes 
We have to show our chests in a row and he looks between our thumbs 
We dont go sick for a horses kick but a bite when youre bending down 
Will make you feel as your goin to peel from the ball of your foot to your 
crown  
And so we go to hospital and if he orders port 
A man lies low Are you better No you ought to hear us snort 
But its hard to stick when anothers sicktheres a empty bed in the 
room 
And worser still when weve finished drill theres another old hoss to 
groom  
But heres to the man of the RAMC 
Buzzing about on the field like a bee 
Tending the wounded where leads flying hot 
Biting his lip when he gets hisself shot 
Brave as the best of us hurt and not tell 
Doctor he may behes soldier as well 
CASUALTIES IN LADYSMITH 
In the list of casualties reported from Ladysmith is the 
name of Major C G Woods of the RAMC who is returned 
as wounded Major C G Woods entered the Army Medical 
Service in 1885 and was promoted SurgeonMajor in I898 He 
served with the Hazara expedition and received the medal 
and clasp He was on general duty with the medical staff in 
Natal 
The name of Lieutenant Hornabrook Medical Officer of the 
Local Forces is also returned as wounded This gentleman 
is we believe Dr Hornabrook who was for some time 
engaged in plague duty in India 
HOSPITALS AND CONVALESCENT HOMES 
Charing Cross Hospital hopes to provide 20 beds for the sick and 
wounded soldiers At the Convalescent Home at Limpsfield Surrey 30 
beds will be available for convalescents 
The Committee of the Royal Orthovaedic Hospital have offered to place 
two wards Io beds at the disposal of the War Office 
The Nicolson Mackenzie Memorial Hospital at Strathpeffer Spa NB 
has offered 4 beds for the treatment of sick and wounded soldiers spe 
cially those of the Highland Brigade 
The Paisley Eye Infirmary has offered to place 8 beds at the disposal of 
the War Office 
The proposal to place the Atkinson Morley Hospital at Wimbledon at 
the service of the War Office for the reception of the sick and wounded 
from South Africa is uncertain of fulfilment owing to legal difficulties in 
connection with the trust 
The Glasgow Corporation has offered to set aside 8 wards in the new 
hospital at Ruehill for the use of the wounded The Glasgow St 
Andrew Ambulance Society also offer to supply free of charge a full 
staff of surgeons and nurses 
The Committee of the Syracuse Convalescent Home at Torquay for 
wounded soldiers sailors and marines appeal for funds to support so 
sufferers the accommodation which the home can afford The War 
Office has approved the scheme and it is proposed to apply half the 
accommodation to wounded men from the Devon Regiment and the 
remainder to other urgent cases 
The scheme which is being organised by the AngloAmerican Gazette of 
Nice for bringing wounded officers to the Riviera is meeting with great 
success Almost every hotel owner between Marseilles and Mentone has 
offered to take in guests free of charge It is computed that already 
accommodation for 200 or 300 officers can be found It was hoped that 
the War Office will see its way to send a hospital ship to Villefranche 
An a ppeal to the residents of Hampstead has been made for x0oo to 
equip Golders Hill as a convalescent home for the Brigade of Guards and 
Household Cavalry and place it at the disposal of the military 
authorities 
The Marquis of Zetland has given his residence Kerse House Falkirk 
for the use o1 the sick and wounded from South Africa 
Mr G R Vernon of Auchano House Kilmarnock has given the 
house to be used as a hospital for convalescent soldiers from South 
Africa 
The Kent and Essex General Investment Company have offered to the 
War Office the use of Purrock Hall Gravesend rent free for twelve 
months as a home for sick and wounded ft om South Africa 
Rules have been promulgated by the War Office directing the conditions 
of the work entrusted to the Soldiers and Sailors Help Society in arrang 
ing accommodation for convalescent soldiers and sailors 
iThere is a movement in Capetown to raise from o20OcotO oooo by public 
subscription with a view to establishing a South African Field Hospital 
on similar lines to the Portland It is proposed that the hospital should 
be staffed wholly by South African colonists

THE FLITTING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
LONDON 
A MEETING of Convocation of the University of London pro 
bably tbe last in the presentUniversity Buildings was held on 
January 15th Mr E H BUSK Chairman presided 
THE LATE SIR JAMES PAGET 
The CHAIRMAN after the suspension of the standing orders 
had been adopted spoke of the conspicuous service rendered 
to the University by Sir James Paget as ViceChancellor His 
sympathetic apt words and singularly clear voice had given 
acute pleasure to very many persons in that hall and would 
never be forgotten by the students whom he had addressed 
He moved a vote expressive of the grief entertained by the 
House at the great loss they had sustained in the death of 
their late ViceChancellor This was duly seconded and 
carried unanimously 
THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY 
Mr BLAKE ODGERS QC presented the report of the Stand 
ing Committee an abstract of which was published in the 
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of January 13th page 94 and 
moved its adoption He congratulated Convocation on the 
termination of the conflict of nearly twenty years which had 
however done good in various ways especially in exciting a 
wide interest in the University The scheme for the recon 
struction which was a compromise promised to be productive 
of great good its final shape was largely due to the Chairman 
of Convocation and the Special and Standing Committees of 
Convocation Under the new statutes Convocation would 
elect about onethird or eighteen members of the Senate all 
of whom would be members of the Council for External Stu 
dents whose duty it would be to keep up the high standard 
of the degrees for those students The election of members of 
the Senate would for the future be through thevarious faculties 
the nextelectionwould be in Maynext whenConvocation would 
probably meet in its new home in the Imperial Institute 
The University however was in no sense the successor of the 
body called the Imperial Institute it had its title to the 
building direct from the Government The portion of the 
building allotted to the University was the centre with the 
eastern wing and the accommodation provided was ample 
far in excess indeed of anything the University had ever 
nad before The library should become worthy of the Uni 
versity and the graduates would have three other excellent 
rooms for writing reading and for meetings The first elec 
tion to the Senate was of great importance Convocation 
should elect only men who were loyally devoted to the new 
scheme and all should forget the diferences that had parted 
them whilst the scheme was being perfected 
Dr R M WALMISLEY DSc seconded the proposal As 
regarded the past he begged Convocation to  bury the 
hatchet and hoped all would now do the best possible for the 
development of the University on the lines of the new 
charter especially in the advancement of learning on post 
graduate lines In regard to research too he trusted that 
many of the needs of the University might be filled by dona 
tions from various publicspirited citizens Lastly hetrusted 
that the transference of the University to its new home might 
be the occasion for some kind of public ceremony 
In the discussion which followed the CHAIRMAN in reply to 
Mr G EASTES MB stated that the new building would 
accommodate under its own roof more than 2000 candidates 
for any single examination 
Dr SILVANUs THOMPSON earnestly appealed to the members 
to sink former party differences and to elect upon the Senate 
the best men to be obtained whose only pledge should be 
to do their best for the reconstituted university 
Mr COTTON protested against the University being turned 
out of its present building but the motion was carried with 
one single dissentient 
THE NEW HOME OF THE UNIVERSITY 
Mr ODGERS QC moved the following resolution recom 
mended by the Standing Committee 
That the Chairman of Convocation be requested to place before the 
Senate the report of the Standing Committee of Convocation on the 
accommodation at the Imperial Institute and to respectfully request that 
the matters isferred to therein may be favourably considered and the 
recommendations contained in it carried into effect 
Going into detail he dealt with three matters of importance 
in respect to the new building I The accommodation for 
graduates 2 the housing of the library which he trusted 
would be in the three handsome rooms on the ground floor 
under the charge of a librarian whose only business it should 
be to attend to the library 3 the lavatot y accommodation for 
graduates and for students attending examinations respec

Sir PHILIP MAGNUS was then voted to the chair and Mr A 
BASSETT HOPrKNS MA moved a resolution expressing 
Convocations deep sense of indebtedness to its Chairman for 
his inestimable services to the University during the past 
eight years Especially during the last few years in connec
