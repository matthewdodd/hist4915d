Union we may state that the most pleasing result is the fact 
that medical men have been brought together in the meetings 
of the various branches and that in the discussion and inter 
change of opinion many old difficulties and misunderstandings 
have been removed and a more cordial professional feeling 
between neighbouring practitioners has been established At 
the commencement we found a sense of distrust amongst 
medical men almost universal but we arc glad to state that 
this is being gradually dissipated and if no other tangible 
advantage had been derived the founders of this Union might 
feel themselves amply repaid for their trouble and work in the 
fact that they had raised the feeling of esprit de corps of the 
profession in this district

THE RATES OF MORTALITY IN THE CONCEN 
TRATION CAMPS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
Parliamentary returns of the number of persons and the 
number of deaths among persons in the concentration camps 
in South Africa are now available for the four months June 
to September inclusive We have prepared an analysis of 
these figures which will enable our readers to study with 
ease the deathrates in these camps For the sake of conve 
nience in the following tables the figures for white persons 
are alone given those for the coloured inhabitants of the 
camps being left for later consideration if necessary 
There are camps in each of the four colonies Natal Cape 
Colony Orange River Colony and the Transvaal The 
returns give no statement of the number of camps or of the 
maximum number in any one camp Table I however 
shows that the number as well as the size of the camps in 
Cape Colony must be very small The only further clue to 
the number of camps is conveyed in the footnotes to the 
returns for July and August In the former it is stated that 
the mortality among the children in the Orange River 
Colony is mainly due to a severe epidemic of measles at 
Kroonstad Springfontein Kimberley Aliwal and Bloem 
fontein and to pneumonia supervening during excessively 
cold weather and in the latter we are informed a severe 
epidemic of measles was prevalent in the larger camps

9Q1MORTALITY 
IN THE CONCENTRATION 
CAMPSmwmSjl

In order to bring these statistics into manageable compass 
the experience of all the camps in the Transvaal Orange River 
Colony and Natal for the four months in question has been 
combined in the following table and placed in contrast with 
that of the small camp or camps in Cape Colony  
Summary Table 
Number of 
Camps in  
Deaths of Deathrate 
It is not assumed that the total number of inhabitants in the 
concentration camps is the number given in the first three 
columns of the above table It must be clearly understood 
that we are dealing with statistics for four consecutive months 
The Government returns do not state whether the population 
of each monthly return consists in part of the population of 
the preceding month and in part of newcomers though this 
may be assumed to be the case We have added together the 
stated populations in each monthly return to obtain the 
average ratio of deaths to population Thus in Table III it 
will be noted that the ratio of deaths in the Orange River 
Colony camps among men was i in 160 in June i in 107 in 
July 1 in 194 in August and 1 in 142 in September  while the 
average was 1 in 144 
These ratios have been given in preference to the annual 
deathrate per 1000 as they represent a statement of actual 
facts and not an inference based on the assumption that the 
same experience would continue during twelve months The 
calamitous experience did however continue and became 
progressively worse during four months  and it is therefore 
justifiable now to proceed on the assumption that it might 
go on for several months longer if not for an entire yearand 
to contrast the above experience with the experience of 
England and Wales for an entire year Later on we shall 
attempt comparison with special communities smitten with 
measles 
An initial difficulty arises in contrasting the experience of 
the camps with that for England and Wales The three 
groups in the returns are men 
 
women and children 
no clue being given as to the definition of child or the pro 
portion of infants of children aged 1 to 5 and of children 
over 5 though these data are essential in order to arrive at 
satisfactory statistics In the absence of these data we 
must have recourse to certain assumptions We will assume 
that all the children were under 5 years of age Probably a 
very considerable proportion were children aged 5 to 15 years 
Inasmuch as the normal deathrate at ages under 5 in 
England is 14 times as high as at ages 5 to 10 and 25 times as 
high as at ages 10 to 15 this assumption probably shows the 
experience of the camps in a too favourable light 
Annual Deathrate

Camps based on four months experience  
In England and Wales based on the 
experi ence of 1899 for children under 5  
322 6 1 in 31 
1 in 180 
When dealing with the deathrates among men and women 
in the camps a similar though not so great a difficulty arises 
The deathrate per 1000 among persons in England and 
Wales ranges from 34 at ages 1520 to 332 at ages 5565 and 
652 at ages 6575 Without attempting any exact com 
parison it is clear that among men the conditions of health 
varied greatly the deaths varying from i in 321 in the Natal 
camps to 1 in 213 in the Transvaal camps and 1 in 144 in the 
Orange River camps 
Women who normally have a much lower deathrate than 
men suffered exoessively the proportion of deaths varying 
in the camps of excessive mortality from 1 in 190 in the Natal 
and 1 in 156 in the Transvaal camps to 1 in 128 in the Orange 
River camps Amongst the 313 women in the Cape Colony 
camps only one died 
Fatality of Measles 
The question arises whether the epidemic of measles fur 
nishes a sufficient explanation for the calamitous deathrate 
shown above Exact statistics as to the severity case 
fatality of measles are somewhat scanty We append the 
following from two reports by Dr T Thomson issued by the 
Local Government Board dealing with urban districts in 
which cases of measles were compulsorily notifiable

Assuming that notification was equally complete in the two 
above districts it is clear that the fatality of measles varies 
greatly in different epidemics There is the strongest reason 
for believing that measles like some other zymotic diseases 
undergoes changes in virulence due to unknown conditions 
If we assume this to have been the case in the present epi 
demic would it reasonably account for the deaths of children 
in a proportion which if continued for a year would have 
killed 1 out of every 31  In District A above the highest 
fatality was during the second year of life when approxi 
mately 1 out of every 5 attacked succumbed but it is un 
reasonable to suppose that all the Boer children were of this 
age and it must be inferred that unless the measles in the 
camps displayed a virulence hitherto almost unknown other 
factors must have been at work 
Historical Epidemics of Measles 
Certain historical epidemics described by Hirsch1 throw 
light on the problem The most often quoted is the Fiji epi 
demic of 1874 which carried off from one fourth to onefifth of 
the whole population of the Fiji group It would be interest 
ing to discuss how far the virulence of this epidemic was 
caused by the fact that the Fijians among whom this was a 
new disease afforded a new and virgin soil for its virulent 
development and how far the lack of proper treatment and 
the exposure of patients to the most unfavourable conditions 
of food and housing were responsible for the result Possibly 
both sets of factors were at work We have no facts bearing 
on the question whether among the Boers who have been 
brought into these concentration camps measles had pre 
viously prevailed It is quite possible that in their scattered 
homesteads measles may have long been absent and that the 
camps thus furnished a most combustible material when the 
spark of infection was introduced 
It does not seem however that absence of previous measles 
can account completely for the high fatality of the present 
epidemic For analogous conditions we must look rather to 
the experience of the Confederate troops during the American 
Civil war and in Paris during the siege of 1871 than to Fiji 
Among the Confederate troops in 1866 measles caused 1900 
deaths out of 38000 cases of sickness or a fatality of 20 per 
cent In Paris out of 215 of the Garde Mobile who took 
measles 86 or 40 percent died Clearly therefore under 
certain conditions among which are overcrowding defective 
sanitation and the influence of unsuitable and possibly scanty

food and depressing mental conditions measles sometimes 
assumes a virulence which is phenomenal 
Causes 
What are the causes which are likely to have been productive 
of the present excessive mortality in the concentration 
camps  
i Almost certainly measles and complicating pneumonia 
are not entirely the cause When the story is completely 
told it will most probably be found that diarrhoea and enteric 
fever have also been prevalent 
2 Some importance must be attached to the fact that a large 
proportion of the Boer children have probably never been 
previously exposed to measles and have now been exposed 
under conditions which ensure concentration of the poison of 
this disease The conditions are analogous to those of a work 
house into the babies ward of which measles is accidentally 
introduced Those who have experienced how fatal measles 
is under such circumstances will have little difficulty in 
partially realising the state of matters in the Boer camps 
3 The Boers are stated to be dirty in their personal habits 
and difficult to control in regard to the elementary rules of 
sanitation necessary to maintain a large camp in a wholesome 
condition Probably this is true It is one of the strongest 
reasons for not permitting dense aggregations of people pos 
sessed of habits which are only safe in detached and lonely 
houses 
4 Possibly unsuitable food and deficient clothing although 
every effort has doubtless been made to remedy these defects 
greatly aided in producing the result 
5 In view of the excessive mortality from enteric fever 
among our own troops to which we have repeatedly drawn 
attention we are bound to suspect that the same unreadiness 
to make provision for probable contingencies has characterised 
the action of the responsible Army authorities in this as in 
other health matters The sanitary control of the large 
camps whether for soldiers or for Boers has been most 
unsatisfactory One of the most important recommendations 
of the recent South African Hospitals Commission was as to 
the necessity for appointing special sanitary officers whose 
duty it would be to organise and control the sanitary arrange 
ments of all large camps The sanitary as distinguished 
from the medical organisation of the South African Army has 
been attended by calamities for which the War Office must be 
held responsible 
Remedies 
What remedies are practicable  
1 The immediate organisation of sanitary control of the 
camps on a scale sufficient to meet all requirements 
2 Splitting up of the camps into a much larger number f 
units each having a separate organisation  visits from camp 
to camp being strictly prohibited The experience of the 
childrens hospitals in Paris gives abundant testimony to the 
dangers of accumulating a large number of measles patients 
These are graphically described by Dr Grancher2who quoted 
Dr Archambault as saying   
Our patients die of the disease 
which they catch not of the disease for which they are ad 
mitted This is particular true of measles Uncomplicated 
measles needs to be treated in a separate building from 
measles associated with bronchopneumonia  and if disinfec 
tion is not required for measles it is desirable for its 
complications By antiseptic and aseptic methods the 
results of treatment of measles in the Paris hospitals 
for children have become much more favourable Such 
methods may not be practicable under the conditions of camp 
life The alternative is that no considerable number of sus 
ceptible children must be grouped together The camps 
must be split up and to some extent scattered This point is 
clearly brought out by Sir Walter Foster in a letter to the 
Times and he also lays stress on the importance of placing 
the camps on nonpolluted soils His words which represent 
the minimum requirements of the case may Joe quoted in 
conclusion  
There are two plans for diminishing the evil which I think should be 
tried at once if they have not already been adopted namely1 The 
larger camps should be broken up into separated small camps so as to 
make the number of persons smaller on each area and 2 the sites on 
which the camps are placed should be regularly changed as fouled soil 
is a prolific cause of disease and a potent factor in increasing its 
virulence

 CONTRACT MEDICAL PRACTICE 
How to Deal with the Difficulties of Contract 
Medical Practice 
Optimist writes  No doubt most readers will agree that Dr 
Larkings paper on Contract Practice is one of the most 
valuable contributions that have been made on this difficult 
subject Neither is Dr Larking in my opinion too optimis 
tic the solution of the question is in our own hands and 
the time is most opportune for action There is however 
just one statement which ought not to pass unmodified It is 
essential that we should all join heartily in the enterprise 
therefore it will be well to confess that practically we all 
are or have been miserable sinners Dr Larking says   
The 
sinners are the younger members of the profession who like 
myself are led into these practices by an interested public 
Now it is notorious that in some districts a very large 
amount of unremunerative contract practice is done by senior 
members of oldestablished firmsmen who often hold high 
positions in our Associationby means of junior partners or 
assistants I point this out in no spirit of recrimination but 
to further the movement Dr Larking so well advocates Dr 
Larkings assertion makes it appear that the duty of begin 
ning rests entirely with the 
u 
younger members because 
they alone sin This is not so on the contrary the junior 
sinners may well look to their elders for an example Pro 
fessional and financial considerations make such a step much 
easier on the part of the oldestablished members I believe 
in most places the younger men would be only too glad to 
follow a good lead 
Warning to Young Practitioners 
SirI read with much interest in the British Medical 
Journal of October 19th your very excellent advice to a 
young practitioner and only trust that no one will sell his 
services at such a low price to any body of working men who 
preach the doctrine of unionism when their own interests 
are threatened 
Surely at the present day when we hear of a decreasing 
number of entries into the profession and a marked increase 
in the time required for study necessary to obtain a degree or 
diploma not mentioning the expenses to parents or guardians 
would it not be well for all young registered practitioners and 
others who are seeking districts to settle in not to accept 
any appointments under Colliery Friendly Society or Medi 
cal Aid Clubs without first making searching inquiries as to 
terms and the reason why their previous medical officer re 
signed or ceased to act for them  Many practitioners who 
accept such appointments for perhaps what looks like a 
tempting offer find out before long that they are slaves to a 
committee who only study their own interests and further 
that they are without friends among their professional 
brethren owing to an omission which might have been easily 
avoided by a little forethought Let us stand together and 
be loyal to each other upholding the traditions handed down 
to us which is the only way to gain public confidence 
I am glad to notice that in many districts doctors are 
waking up to the importance of combining which is a sure 
means of protecting themselvesI am etc

The Royal Free Hospital has received from Mr George 
Courtauldthe sum of 1000 to endow a bed in memory of his 
daughter the late Miss Louise Courtauld 
At the opening of the Glasgow Veterinary College for the 
present session Principal McCall gave an address in which 
he referred to the unsatisfactory position in which the Scot 
tish veterinary colleges were placed There were three such 
colleges but they were all private institutions and received no 
Government recognition 
or support The Government had 
instituted a veterinary college in Dublin and given a grant 
in aid

should be affiliated and their management organised in such 
a way that they might be able to earn a grant from the Scotch 
Education Department
