Hallams restriction to this country were removed His book 
passed through many editions on the Continent within forty 
years  it won the high praise of Galileo Gilbert has been 
called the father of modern electricity by Priestley and 
the Galileo of magnetism by Poggendorff When the 
British Association last met at Bradford in 1873 the modern 
theory which largely reverts to Gilberts way of formulation 
and refers electric and magnetic phenomena to the activity of 
the ether instead of attractions at a distance was of recent 
growth  it had received its classical exposition only two years 
before by the publication of Clerk Maxwells treatise The 
new doctrine was already widely received in England on its 
own independent merits On the Continent it was engaging 
the strenuous attention of Helmholt z whose series of memoirs 
deeply probing the new ideas in their relation to the prevalent 
and fairly successful theories of direct action across space had 
begun to appear in 1870 During many years the search for 
crucial experiments that would go beyond the results equally 
explained by both views met with small success  it was not 
until 1887 that Hertz by the discovery of the ethereal radia 
tion of long wavelength emitted from electric oscillators 
verified the hypothesis of Faraday and Maxwell and initiated 
a new era in the practical development of physical science 
Animal Electricity 
Professor F Gotch delivered an evening address on Animal 
Electricity He said that animal electricity if strictly inter 
preted had a most extensive scope commensurate indeed 
with all forms of animal life The study had however a 
special significance in connection with one class of living 
structuresnamely those which constituted the nervous 
system There was absolutely no doubt that organs of an 
essentially nervous type existed the prime object of whose 
activity was the production of electrical disturbances Such 
were the electrical organs found in a few groups of widely 
different fishes Every electrical organ was built up of 
columns containing a vast number of special structures 
arranged in series and to make these essential features clear 
and at the same time to bring forward all known instances of 
electrical fish a series of slides were shown As to the 
characters of the organ shock Professor Gotch exhibited a 
living specimen of Malapterurus which had been lent for the 
purpose by the Liverpool Corporation Museum through the 
kindness of the director Dr Forbes Experiments were made 
to show that the shock of the fish could effect the mercurial 
column of a capillary electrometeriand that in this way 
photographic records of the shock could be obtained Such photo 
graphic records showed that each shock was multiple that is 
to say the electrical organ once it had been made to 
produce its shock would go on doing so automatically 
The power of each blowin other words its electromotive 
forcewas astounding in a fish about 8 inches long Pro 
fessor Gotch had determined that under favourable conditions 
the first electrical disturbance could reach a maximum of 200 
volts and that this could develop in twothousandths of a 
second This astounding voltage would be produced when 
the electrical effect in each single disc reached only four 
hundredths of a volt Illustrations were then given of the 
mode of following the electrical disturbance occurring in a 
nerve during the passage of a single nervous impulse from a 
very large number of experiments made in conjunction with 
Mr G J Burch FRS Professor Gotch said that it appeared 
that the nerve electrical effect was very similar to that 
present in each disc of the electrical organ Finally he 
Drought forward evidence to show that there must be at 
electrical disturbance in the nerveendings of the orgar 
whenever a nervous impulse might be produced out 
side the nerves The astounding effects produced by the 
electrical organs of fishes thus had their physiological 
counterpart in nerves  and in this as in other departments 
of natural science Nature showed no gulf

THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
BRITISH PRISONERS AT PRETORIA 
The report of the Court of Inquiry held at Pretoria last June 
to inquire into the treatment of British prisoners but more 
especially of sick prisoners in the hands of the Boers in and 
near Pretoria which was issued by the War Office on Sep 
tember 12th together with Lord Robertss observations thereon 
makes very disagreeable reading Lord Robertss comment 
with reference to the treatment of sick prisoners is as follows  
a The inhuman treatment of the sick prisoners throws the greatest 
discredit on the authorities at Pretoria who must have been aware that 
proper hospital accommodation and equipment had not been provided 
that suitable food and medical comforts were not forthcoming and that the 
supply of medicines and medical appliances was wholly insufficient That 
the deficiencies referred to in the correspondence were to some extent 
made good by the exertions and liberality of private individuals does not 
exonerate the Government of the South African Republic from its respon 
sibility in this matter and the indifference which was shown to the suf 
ferings of the sick among the British prisoners is the more inexcusable 
when it is remembered that the sick among the Boer prisoners have in 
variably received the same care and attention as our own sick soldiers 
Lord Roberts adds that the efforts of Drs P H Haylett and 
R von Gernet to ameliorate the condition of their patients 
and the assistance rendered by burghers and British civilians 
by whom a fund to supply the deficiencies was raised are 
the only gratifying features in the correspondence He 
adds on the other hand 
 that it would be difficult to 
condemn too strongly the conduct of Dr H P Veale 
MBCambridge whose heartlessness in ignoring the dis 
graceful treatment of the sick prisoners and the remon 
strances addressed to him by the medical officers in imme 
diate charge of them calls for the severest reprobation 
Dr Yeale in his evidence stated that he along with Drs 
Knobell and Lingbeek were the three medical members of the 
Transvaal Branch of the Geneva Red Cross Society Dr 
Veale was responsible for the care and medical attendance of 
the prisoners of war at the racecourse but denied that he had 
anything to do with the sanitary arrangements although he 
admitted that it would be his duty as medical officer attending 
the sick to notice and try to remedy anything in the arrange 
ments of the hospital or its precincts prejudicial to health 
He stated that he did bring several points to notice and con 
sidered that everything in the racecourse hospital was reason 
ably satisfactory when he left at the beginning of December 
Dr P H Haylett who was appointed to take charge of the 
hospital at the racecourse in December stated that there was 
no adequate provision of medicines considerable difficulty in 
obtaining stimulants and no means of keeping the hospital 
buildings clean The refuse of the hospital was left close to 
the buildings there were no sheets and but a few pillows In 
January he went out to Waterval as medical officer for the 
prisoners there and at once reported in writing to Dr Veale 
condemning the sanitary arrangements the water supply 
and the hospital building and its equipment Eventually 
protests having been unavailing Dr Haylett resigned 
and in February Dr Rudolph von Gernet was ap 
pointed in his place Dr Gernet stated that he found the 
I prisoners housed in sheds built of corrugated iron open 
towards the front and with leaking roofs The central road 
I was higher than the floor of the sheds so that the rain water 
drained into them and the men were lying in water on the 
bare ground The surroundings were in an indescribably 
filthy condition The latrines were within 50 yards 
of the night camp in which the men slept These 
latrines which consisted of trenches were filled by the heavy 
rain and the contents were floated all over the place  
The supply of drinking water was insufficient the prisoners 
were clothed in rags and though the building used as a 
hospital was satisfactory the furniture was absolutely un 
satisfactory For 60 inpatients and 20 orderlies there were 
only 21 bedsteads 11 mattresses and 49 blankets Nearly all 
the sick were lying on the floor without bedding or pillows 
and there were 41 typhoid cases for whom there were no suit 
able medicines The food supply of the hospital was insuffi 
cient 
Dr von Gernet took vigorous action and brought the de 
ficiencies before the notice of the Committee charged with 
the care of the prisoners This Committee acted promptly

and President Kiuger took an interest in the question so 
that eventually the defects noted weie remedied It there 
fore appears clear that had Dr Yeale shown at an earlier date 
more vigour and independence and better appreciation of 
the responsibilities he had accepted these defects would have 
been earlier remedied 
THE MOOI RIVER HOSPITAL NATAL 
We are indebted to Mr Charles S S Johnston architect of 
Edinburgh for the following extracts from a communication 
which he has received from Major Henry H Johnston 
RAMC giving some particulars as to the results of the 
treatment of enteric fever at that hospital It will be re 
membered that an interesting account of this hospital from 
the pen of the late Sir William Stokes was published in the 
British Medical Journal of April 28th In that paper is 
embodied a note by Major H H Johnston describing the pre 
cautions taken to prevent the spread of enteric fever Major 
Johnston writes as follows  
Since No 4 General Hospital was opened on January 6th 
1900 there have been up to the present date August 10th a 
total of 6581 patients treated in it and 207 deaths For 
wounds received in action there bave been 1707 admissions 
and 46 deaths  operations 222 For enteric fever 1150 admis 
sions and 114 deaths The mortality from enteric fever has 
been 10 per cent which is very low and as there are only 2 
patients dangerously ill out of the 51 enteric fever patients re 
maining in hospital the percentage mortality from that dis 
eae will not be perceptibly increased 
In addition to the admissions for enteric fever there have 
been a large number for socalled simple continued fever 
many cases of which were probably mild cases of enteric fever 
but from which there bave been no deaths If these doubtful 
ases were added to the admissions for enteric fever the per 
centage mortality for the latter disease would be still lower 
than what I have mentioned 
The enteric fever patients have been well looked after in 
this hospital They are treated in double  roofed 
and walled marquees with wooden floors and there 
are six beds in each marquee There is one nursing 
sister for every six marquees 36 patients and in 
each marquee there are two ward orderlies from 6 am 
to 8 pm and one orderly from 8 pm to 6 am The night 
orderly is on duty for a week at a time  he has hot chocolate 
and biscuits at 2 am and he has no day duty to perform 
during his weeks turn of night duty This system is in 
finitely better than that of making the orderlies throughout 
the whole hospital take their turns of night duty in addition 
to their daily work because under the latter system which 
prevails throughout the army the orderlies are fatigued and 
sleepy at night after their days work and there is also the 
risk of orderlies from the surgical wards having their hands 
contaminated with enteric excreta and infecting patients 
wounds 
The favourable results obtained in this hospital are due to 
the good hygienic conditions under which the patients have 
been treated in a healthy bracing climate 4550 feet above 
sea level under the skilful treatment of the civil surgeons 
the care and devotion of the nursing sisters and orderlies with 
the abundant supply of milk and other articles of food of good 
quality suitable for enteric fever patients 
The drinking water for the whole hospital is obtained from 
the Mooi river and it is passed through a large automatic 
PAfiteurChamberland filter containing about 350 filtering 
tubes 
The soldiers especially those of the regular army have 
been very good patients cheerful and always ready to submit 
to any operation that was recommended by the medical 
officers They have received liberal diet and extras and 
many presents of tobacco notepaper fruit fish biscuits etc 
from publicaid institutions and private individuals 
From June ist to July 31st the maximum temperature in 
the shade in a Stevensons screen 4 feet above the ground 
has ranged between 50o F and 74o F by day and the 
minimum in the same situation between  F and 53o F 
by night The greatest daily range was 50o F on July Ttb 
when the minimum was 15 F and tbe maxinr urn 65o F The 
lowest range was Io F on July 31st when the minimum wfs 
53 F and the maximum 61 
 F on a cloudy day There was 
frost on 20 nights in June and on 18 nights in July Rain 
fell on 3 days in June and 5 days in July but with tbe excep 
tion of a heavy shower on the night of July 2425U1 only a few 
drops fell on each occasion In all the occupied hospital 
marquees there are single and duplex

CASUALTIES 
Among the casualties repoited by Lord Roberts from Belfast 
Transvaal under date of September 9th we regret to notice 
the name of Major G Hilhard R AMC C MG who was 
severely wounded near Doom h op on September 6th Major 
Hilliard succumbed to his wounds in the General Hospital 
Newcastle on September 7th Major Hilliard was appointed 
SurgeonCaptain February 5th 1887 and Major twelve years 
thereafter He served in Ashanti under Sir Francis Scott in 
18956 and received the star granted for that expedition 
He went to the God Coast in 1895 and proceeded thence to 
the Cape of Good Hope in the following year remaining in 
South Africa until his decease He had nearly completed 
hi839th year 
We also regret to observe that among those reported missing 
on September 5th after the action near Warm Baths is 
Mr A Cradock Fry LRCP MRCS MA MB 
BCCantab of the 9th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry 
Red Cross Society 
At a monthly meeting of the Cape of Good Hope Society on 
September 3rd Sir John Furley Chief Commissioner of the 
Red Cross Society said that he had recently visited the 
hospitals in Pretoria Johannesburg and other centres and 
that he found the arrangements for caring for the sick and 
wounded most excellent All had abundant supplies He 
spoke in glowing terms of the grand work accomplished by 
the London Central Committee and hoped that it would 
become a permanent organisation The result of the co 
operation of the civil military and hospital organisations had 
been very gratifying Sir John Furley added that the strain 
was now practically over and he considered that there was no 
further need of appealing to the public for subscriptions but 
he admitted that private assistance was necessary and would 
be welcome 
THE PLAGUE 
GLASGOW 
There are 16 cases of plague under treatment in Glasgow an 
increase of 3 during the past week No deaths have occurred 
from the disease during the week Four capes are under ob 
servation as suspects and 113 persons are detained as con 
tacts 
The source of the epidemic has not yet been discovered 
though there is a general feeling in favour of some connection 
between it and shipping Nothing so far has been discovered 
to indicate that the rats have had anything to do with the 
infection Careful investigations are being made on this 
point and the rats which are being killed in large numbers 
in the infected area are subjected to pathological and bac 
teriological examination by Dr R M Buchanan the city 
bacteriologist but up to the present with negative results 
Prevalence of the Disease 
India 
There were 449 deaths from plague during the week ending August 20th 
for all India against 285 in the previous week In Bombay City 51 deaths 
from plague occurred during the week eudiog August 19th  the death 
rate in the city however has increased from 1522 to 197c Cholera is 
responsible for much of the increased mortality out unless an analysis 
of the ailments is before us it is impossible to say whether pneumonia 
fevers etc which play so important a part in plague epden i s are used 
as terms to conceal the presence of plague or not In the Presidency of 
Bombay 64 deaths occurred as against 45 dur in er the previ ou week For 
the week ending August 20th 64 deaths occurred in Calcutta from plague
