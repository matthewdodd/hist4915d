Nov 25 1899 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
mm B 1487 a 
and safe as the crests of the rolling undulations Haematuria 
 red water  is referred to among parasitic diseases as com 
mon in the lowlying coast country it is also common I 
may add in the lowlying portions of the Transvaal but 
these as already stated are not likely to be occupied to any 
extent by our soldiers The tributaries of the Croco 
dile River to the immediate north of Johannesburg are 
infested with the bilharzia parasite The reference to pneu 
monia is brief but states that it often occurs in the form of 
epidemics in the Transvaal during the winter months As 
already pointed out the mortality from this disease on the 
highlands of South Africa is high and although it is more 
prevalent in winter than summer it is liable to occur all the 
year round 
DISINFECTION 
A final note in this Appendix commends certain reports 
for the perusal of the medical officers joining the field force 
It also adds that any medical officer considering that in 
order to carry out effectively the measures indicated above 
for the prevention of disease in connection with standing 
camps additional materials such as disinfectants are 
required he should make an immediate demand for them 
If as I have already suggested the medical officer will only 
bear in mind that mother earth is by far the most economical 
and admirable material for his purpose he will be able to 
avoid unnecessary demands for other disinfectants which 
may not be readily obtainable at some odd hundred miles 
from our bases 
THE WAR IN SOUTTH AFRICA 
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRFSPONDENT IN CAPETOWN 
November 1st 
THE CENSORSHIP 
IT is impossible at the present time to send much news with 
reference to the military medical arrangements for the cam 
paign In the first place the dispositions which have eo far 
been made are merely of a temporary nature and will be alto 
gether remodelled as soon as General Buller has matured his 
plans and secondly the censorship is so strict that scarcely 
any information is obtainable as to what has actually been 
done When I tell you that the Berkshire Regiment were at 
Stormberg Junction at least a week before any newspaper in 
Capetown published the informatioin and that only by very 
slow degrees has the news leaked out that a force in full of 
some 2500 men is at another pointDe Aarthe readers 
of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL will understand this 
And as ven Royal Army Medical Corps information may give 
a rough indication as to troops either being at a particular 
place or being likely to be sent there it is except in the 
simplest details invariably refused For this reticence the 
ever present Boer spy must be held responsible Such details 
as are obtainable I will however give 
EXCELLENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY THE ROYAL 
ARMY MEDICAL CORPS 
The arrangements for the war as carried on thus far appear 
to be very complete The Natal force I am assured from 
several trustworthy and independent sources is admirably 
provided from the medical side Colonel Supple the Prin 
cipal Medical Officer took a journey there shortly before war 
broke out and saw to every detail so completely that there 
was practically nothing to do when Sir George White and his 
staff arrived And the arrangements he then made have 
stood the test of practice for the Royal Army Medical Corps 
has proved thoroughly equal to its work at the fairly 
severe engagements that have already occurred Contrary 
to what has sometimes happened nothing has been 
wanting and mirabile dictu matdriel and personnel have so far 
always been at the right place The bearer company work 
was heavy at Elandslaagte owing to the extent of ground 
covered and the intervention of darkness immediately after 
the action but it was extremely well done Men who were 
there write me that the Indian bearers are preferred to their 
white comrades having as one phrases it  the hands of a 
woman and they exhibit an absolute indifference to the 
risks of being under fire It is not contemplated to have a 
base hospital in Natal the present arrangement being that 
base hospital patients will be brought down here by ship and 
taken to Wynberg a fashionable suburb about nine miles 
from this city The barracks there have been entirely 
vacated and converted into a hospital capable of holding 
from 550 to 6oo patients It is with very good reason 
cogisidered that the hot climate of Durban in the summer 
precludes that place from being used as a hospital base At 
present no base hospital except Wynberg has been arranged 
for but it is quite possible that others may be established at 
Port Elizabeth and East London This however depends 
entirely on the lines of advance which Sir Redvers Buller 
may adopt Neither place is an ideal situation for a hospital 
owing to depressing weather in summer whilst the climate of 
Wynberg in fact the whole of the Cape Peninsula is all that 
could be desired 
TRANSPORT OF SICK AND WOUNDED 
There is nothing special to note about the Wynberg Hos 
pital It is fitted up in the ordinary way and is well found 
in every respect Should any considerable column advance 
along the eastern frontier a base hospital in that direction 
might be necessary as the long railway journey would be try 
ing and as neither Port Elizabeth nor East London has a good 
harbour sending men down by sea would involve a good deal 
of trouble and risk 
Durban is only open to this latter objection in a very slight 
degree A consignment of sick is already on its way from 
Natal The ailments are varied but I am told include a 
good many cases of dysentery or dysenteric diarrhcea I 
should mention that the accommodation at Wynberg could be 
easily supplemented by huts if necessary and that there is 
excellent railway communication right from the Capetown 
Docks to the Wynberg Station which is very near the hos 
pital 
THE AMBULANCE TRAINS 
The idea is to make use of the railway line to the utmost 
extent possible and two trains have been already constructed 
at the local works of the Cape Government Railways under 
the supervision of the Principal Medical Officer 1 bad the 
opportunity of inspecting these yesterday and found them 
very complete and well designed Seven vehicles have been 
built with two combined pharmacy and kitchen coaches It 
is intended to run them as two trains usually but 
although there is through communication from car to car each 
is detachable and a train or trains can be made up as desired 
Three of the ambulance vehicles are fitted for 4 officers and 20 
men and four for 4 officers and I2 men Being on a narrow gauge 
line they are of course somewhat deficient in width but 
they are roomy enough for all practical purposes The bunks 
are arranged lengthwise in two tiers the upper furnished 
with weather boards The mattresses are stuffed with horse 
hair and covered with Berkmeyers prepared waterproof can 
vas an excellently cool and cleanable  material Each 
bunk has a handy locker for books glasses and the like The 
four officer bunks are at one end screened off by curtains 
Between these bunks and the rest are the side entrances 
to the vehicles and at this point the uprights sup 
porting the corner bunks can be turned aside on a 
hinge thus allowing of turning a stretcher without 
difficulty There are of course entrances at each 
end of the coaches Each coach contains a couple of 
seats for attendants a set of pigeonholes for dressings or 
bottles and a watercloset The latter discharges direct on to 
the line without any flush of water a somewhat objectionable 
arrangement certain to lead to fouling of the sides of the 
funnel Ventilation is excellent being on the double ridge 
plan the opening being closed by adjustable screw flaps 
The pharmacy waggons contain a very well equipped dis 
pensary with store room a kitchen pantry with refrigerating 
cupboards room for patients clothing with arm racks and 
bunks for six attendants There is also a very handy shower 
bath with dressing room The cars are lighted with oil 
lamps The officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps and 
some others of the personnel will be provided with an ordinary 
saloon carriage The vehicles themselves are calculated to 
accommodate 12 or I5 personnel They are intended to run 
up and down the main line of communication 
THE WORK OF THE CAPETOWN CENTRE OF THE ST JOHN 
AMBULANCE 
As at present arranged the Royal Army Medical Corps will 


1488 
TM t I MEDICAT ARRANGEMENTd FOR SOUTH AFRICA lNov 25 189 
convey the wounded or sick as far as De Aar the principal 
junction of the Colony and there the trains will be taken in 
hand by parties of trained attendants provided by the Cape 
town centre of the St John Ambulance Association who will 
convey them to Wynberg A medical officer will of course 
accompany each train throughout The conveyance of sick 
brought from Natal by sea from the ships to Wynberg will 
also be in the hands of the St John people For this purpose 
three vehicles have been constructed to hold stretchers racked 
on the American plan This employment of the St John 
Association seems a wise arrangement as it will set free a 
certain number of the Royal Army Medical Corps for more 
responsible work 
THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS 
SurgeonGeneral Wilson arrived yesterday with his Secre 
taryMajorBedfordRAMC MajorAndersonRAMCisin 
medical charge at beleaguered Mafeking and Lieut OGorman 
RAMC at Kimberley each with small detachments of 
their corps At both places a large amount of civilian ambu 
lance help has been organised Dr Hayes being at the head at 
the former place and Dr Smith I believe at the latter 
A number of civil surgeons have already arrived from 
England and are for the present at Wynberg and Capetown 
It is intended as far as possible to keep them at the hospitals 
This engaging of English civilians appears somewhat super 
fluous as there are numbers of Colonial men eager to take 
duty for the pay that would be given to their home brethren 
Apart from the fact that South Africa is normallv overstocked 
in the medical line most of our brethren from Johannesburg 
are at present without occupation 
There are various detachments of the Royal Army Medical 
Corps dotted about at Orange River De Aar Nauwpoort 
Stormberg and intermediate points At De Aar a station 
hospital is being formed which will be used largely as inter 
mediate between the front and Wynberg 
THE CAPE VOLUNTEER MEDICAL STAFF CORPS 
About 40 of the Cape Volunteer Medical Staff Corps a very 
welltrained body of men have gone to the various points 
mentioned above Their commanding officer SurgeonMajor 
Cox is at De Aar A field dressing has been served out to 
each man in all the four Several army nurses who arrived 
last week are at Wynberg where they will probably remain 
THE DIRECTORGENERAL ON THE MEDICAL 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
SURGEONGENERAL J JAMESON MD CB DirectorGeneral 
of the Army Medical Service in responding to the toast of 
The Guests at the annual dinner of the British Gyneco 
logical Society said 
We have lately completely transformed the surgical equip 
ment of the army and brought it up to date sothat every 
army surgeon in South Africa has now an opportunity of 
carrying out in a thorough manner modem and scientific 
surgery Mr Makins before leaving for the war was shown 
the nature of the equipment and the only suggestion he 
could make was the addition to it of a few extra nailbrushes 
At my suggestion three of the most eminent surgeons in 
EnglandSir William Mac Cormac Mr Treves and Mr 
Makinshave been appointed by the Secretary of State to act as 
consulting surgeons at the seat of war This is no reflection 
upon the skill of the medical officers of the army Such 
appointments are in accordance with Continental customs and 
in harmony with ourscheme of mobilisation for home defence 
The presence of such men will be advantageous by reason of 
their wide experience and dexterity and I am sure that my 
brother officers in South Africa will welcome them with open 
arms 
The War Office recognising the usefulness in war of 
hospital transports have sent out two capable of accom 
modating in each about I70 officers and men They are light 
draught vessels able to cross the bar at Durban and be 
brought alongside the wharves so as to facilitate embarkation 
of sick and wounded In fitting them up we had the benefit of 
the advice of an able naval officer and of one of our own 
officers conversant with details and together they made an 
excellent job of it They are intended to run between Durban 
and the Cape 
The Central Committee of the British Red Cross Society are 
determined to go one better and it is likely they will succeed 
They have chartered the Midnight Sun a vessel probably 
known to many of you and her equipment is nearly complete 
She will be renamed the Princess of Wales in compliment to 
Her loyal Highness who not only takes a deep interest in all 
that concerns the happiness comfort and welfare of soldiers 
but has handed over to the Central Committee a fund of over 
6ioooo which was at Her Royal Highnesss disposal The 
personnel will he supplied by the Royal Army Medical Corps 
supplemented by civil surgeons and nurses from the Army 
Nursing Reserve 
The American ladies of London headed by Lady Randolph 
Churchill are fitting out a fourth ship and American 
ingenuity thoroughness and liberality are certain to make it 
a success The personnel will be entirely American with the 
exception of one retired army surgeon whose presence on 
board is considered advantageous for disciplinary purposes 
and the preparation of invaliding documents the correctness 
of which may influence rewards and rates of pension The last 
two ships are intended to ply between the Cape and England 
A hospital train is also being prepared under the direction 
of Sir John Furley Sir John is perhaps the greatest living 
authority on ambulance work He has devoted his whole life to 
mitigate the sufferings of war This train will be named the 
 Princess Christian in grateful acknowledgment of the 
businesslike ability which Eer Royal Highness has shown as 
a member of the Central Committee and in the creation of the 
Army Nursing Reserve 
Roentgen xray apparatus has been supplied liberally 
There are now ten in South Africa one I am happy to state 
is at Ladysmith at the present time Through the generosity 
of private individuals three more will be sent out We have 
engaged an expert able to repair the instruments if necessary 
or indeed to make them A large number of our officers are 
experienced in this form of photography 
In this war there are two powerful enemies to contend with 
the Boers and enteric fever In this connection I may be 
permitted to state that the DirectorGeneral of the United 
States Army Medical Service in a letter just received 
mentions that in their late war in Cuba enteric fever was 
much more deadly to their troops than gunshot wounds In 
Natal last year the admissionrate for enteric fever was 52 per 
cent Extraordinary precautions are therefore urgently 
required After numerous experiments at Netley we came to 
the conclusion that of the numerous filters in the market only 
two possessed sterilising powers the PasteurChamberland 
and the Berkefeld We tried the first during the late war in 
Ashanti but it would not stand the roughness of transport 
and soon became unserviceable The Berkefeld is more port 
able and less fragile The field pattern adopted has a power 
of sterilising 4o gallons of water in an hour that filter 
has been issued to each company of each regiment 
in South Africa and to all units of corresponding 
strength As probably you are aware Professor Wright 
of Netley has been for some years experimenting bj inocula 
tion against enteric fever The results are encouraging Thus 
out of 2ooo men inoculated whose ages were under 24 the 
admissionrate in eight months has been 07 per cent 
while in 6ooo men not inoculated whose ages were greater and 
susceptibility therefore less the admissionrate for the same 
period was exactly doublenamely 14 per cent Of late 
every officer and man under orders for India or South Africa 
has been given the opportunity of being inoculated and about 
70 per cent have taken advantage of it 
Gentlemen the results of all these elaborate preparations 
remain to be told and when Sir Redvers Bullers despatches 
are published at the end of the war I shall be content if he 
expresses himself in regard to my Service in language similar 
to that used by Lord Kitchener when referring to the war in 
the Soudan that it was characterised by a maximum of com 
fort and a minimum of suffering

THE HOSPITAL SHIP  PRINCESS OF WALES 
THE hospital ship Princess of Wales formerly known to many 
tourists as the Midnight Sun was brought round to Tilbury 
Dock this week and will sail immediately The ship has

been chartered by the Central British Red Cross Committee 
and has been planned and fitted up entirely by Major W G 
Macpherson RAMC The Princess of Wales has borne the 
entire cost of fitting the ship and has devoted to this purpose 
9ooo balance of Her Royal Highnesss Fund raised at the 
time of the Soudan campaign Her Royal Highness has 
taken the greatest personal interest in every detail of the 
fittings and has added another Xiooo to be spent in luxuries 
and comforts for the wounded soldiers Her Royal Elighnesss 
Committee for carrying this out have worked as a branch of 
the Red Cross Society and consisted of the Marchioness of 
Lansdowne the Viscountess Wolseley the Lady Wantage 
Mrs Wilton Phipps Hon Sydney Holland Chairman Sir 
Donald Currie MP KCMG Sir John Furley and Major 
Macpherson The Princess of Wales who was accompanied 
by the Prince of Wales Princess Victoria and the Duchess of 
York paid a private visit to the ship on Wednesday after 
noon

A special bed table is fixed to the lee rail of all the cots 
except in the Convalescent Ward This table can be placed 
alongside or aport the lee rail as the occupant may desire 
Fifty bed headrests specially constructed to fit the cots are sup 
plied and the cots are specially constructed to permit of being 
readily lifted from the stanchions without moving the patients 
Each cot can thus be carried on deck and placed on the deck 
trestles as desired The Convalescent Ward has messing 
tables for all the patients and in the other wards there are 
seats for about 25 per cent 
The Operating Room 
The operating room which adjoins the surgical ward is 
fitted with an operating table an operationroom sink a 
Schimmelbusch steriliser a fresh water tap with Berkefeld 
sterilising bougie an electric grid for boiling water and a 
table and cupboard for instruments and surgical material 
The room is lighted by fixed electric lights and there is also 
a portable electric light The operating room is on the lower 
deck amidships 
A Roentgen ray outfit the cost of which has been defrayed 
by the Duke of Newcastle has been supplied by Messrs 
Harry W Cox Limited It consists of the following ap 
paratus 
One Cox special record portable io coil in polished mahogany case com 
plete 
One specially made polished oak table for coil consisting of platform 
or coil and tube stand  the latter can be screwed down if necessary with

One malhogany dark slide 
One thoracoscope 
One Hickss patent hydrometer bead 
One Hickss patent hydrometer flat 
One 2volt cell tester 
It will be observed that no localising apparatus has been 
ordered an omission which we think is to be regretted as 
calculated to diminish the practical value of the apparatus 
An isolation ward and dispensary have been provided and 
the ship has also three refrigerating rooms for fresh meat 
Convalescents 
The ship is fitted throughout with the electric light and 
electric call bells between the wards and the quarters of the 
medical officers and nursing sisters have been provided The 
whole of the promenade deck will be available for the patients 
and hospital orderlies and the bridge deck for the officers and 
nursing sisters All these decks have been provided with 
double awnings throughout and in addition to fixed garden 
seats on the decks 4o deck chairs and 6o camp stools there 
are 50 cane chairs given by Princess Christian The Princess

have also been given by others The Princess of Wales has 
also presented a large quantity of tobacco pipes and 
cigarettes which will be distributed to patients as may be 
expedient 
Embarkation 
Careful consideration has been given to the means for 
placing the sick and wounded on board Abaft of the starboard 
alleyway there are large side ports by which patients can be 
placed direct on the main ward deck and access is obtained to 
the other wards by the starboard alleyway and the main com 
panion Two naval hammocks for wounded six naval cots 
with slinging poles and two naval cot undercarriages have 
been placed on board for use in case of necessity 
Warming and Water Supply 
The ship can we warmed throughout by steampipes and 
cooled in the tropics by electric fans and scuttle ventilators 
The ship has ample cold chambers for preserving meat Pro 
vision has been made for the production of IO cwts of ice 
daily and a special watercooling apparatus has been fitted 
The water supply is from condensers capable of condensing 
2000 to 3000 gallons daily and from reserve freshwater tanks 
of the capacity of 30000 gallons Fresh water is laid on to 
all the wards and lavatories to the operating room dis 
pensary troop deck and laundry sea water to the baths

THE LADIES COMMITTEE AT ALDERSHOT 
A subject connected with the help given by ladies at Alder 
shot to Government in the matter of regiments proceeding to 
South Africa and the outbreak of infectious disease there is 
well worthy of mention During the time an outbreak of 
scarlet fever occurred which it was thought might have de 
lay ed some of the regiments going out to the seat of war Lady 
Audrey Buller and the Ladies Committee with the entire sanc 
tion of Sir Redvers Buller took measures for improving 
the means for the isolation of those who had come in contact 
with the infected cases A qualified nurse was engaged for 
the isolation block and under her direction and supervision 
the most complete precautions were taken to prevent any 
risk of the spread of infection clothes were provided for 
those isolated so that all clothing and bedding might be 
thoroughly disinfected As a result of these precautions the 
outbreak was confined to narrow limits and the despatch of 
the troops was not inlerlered with It is gratifying to learn 
from a local source that the same machinery will be again 
set in motion whenever required not only because of its 
benefit to the nation but also to secure the wellbeing of 
soldiers families

THE UNDERMANNING OF THE ARMY MEDICAL 
SERVICE 
THE undermanned condition as regards officers of the Army 
Medical Service long continued and notorious has resulted 
under the pressure of war in a condition of things 
which it is impossible to blink and is causing no little 
anxiety to those who choose to look beneath the surface 
This is apparent from the following analysis of the distribu 
tion of the officers according to the monthly Army List for 
November 
In the table they are enumerated in three groups 
namely home South Africa and other foreign stations 
together with those seconded largely for service with the 
Egyptian army and those with no stations alter their names 
presumably the sick and such as at the moment are unpostedi 
on return from foreign relief

The table first discloses that the Army Medical Service is 
still 6o below the total of 890 which a late DirectorGeneral 
described as a perilously low establishment Next that 
83 per cent of its effective strength are at present serving 
abroad and only about i6 per cent of its executive strength 
were available for contingencies on November ist This latter 
by the mobilisation of a fifth division must now be reduced 
to a nominal i I per cent In other words barely Ico medical 
officers are available to complete the mobilisation of a second 
army corps should that prove necessary and not a man will 
be left at home to fill vacancies Of course it may be argued 
that with the bulk of the army abroad home duties are 
lessened which if broadly true is by no means so in a pro 
portionate sense Unless the military hospitals are to be 
closed we presume they must be administered under the 
command and control of commissioned medical officers no 
others have the requisite authority But they will all be 
needed to receive the sick of 27000 militia about to be em 
bodied who have no medical officers of their own 
A certain number of retired medical officers are employed 
especially in the allimportant and now pressing recruiting 
duties and others  liable to recall will doubtless also be 
employed But even if every one of these available were at 
work they would afford no solution to the problem how 
medical casualties in the field and abroad are to be met We 
will take for granted that all time and tour reliefs must be 
suspended during the war these may wait but death and 
invaliding cannot be postponed Every casualty in South 
Africa and our foreign garrisons among commissioned medical 
officers must therefore remain unfilled 
Is this a safe or creditable position for a great and humane 
country which boasts a large part of the empire of the world 
to be in  We have over and over again called attention to 
the grievously undermanned condition ofour medical services 
both at home and in India Now the din of war may open 
hitherto deaf ears 
We challenge contradiction that our army medical esta 
blishment should at least consist of Iooo officers Now is 
the time when the Army Estimates are being framed to pro 
vide for this number No House of Commons would deny 
such an obviously reasonable vote If the establishment is 
voted the officers will be found
