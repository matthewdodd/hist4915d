Colonel RAMC 
Mool RiverJan 22 1900 PMO No 4 General Hospital 
The public will regard the above letter as the most cheering piece of 
intelligence they have yet received with regard to any of the military 
hospitals It is satisfactory to be assured that one among them claims to 
be considered well equipped Our columns upon January 12th contained 
the following appeal 
1 No 4 General Hospital with 520 beds has been established at Mooi 
River and the sick and wounded commenced coming in yesterday It is 
very difficult to obtain those comforts so necessary in a hospital at Mooi 
River and such will be thankfully received and acknowledged if sent 
Packages should be addressed to Colonel Clery RAMC The hotel has 
been taken over as a hospital for officers 
As we are aware that hundreds of sheets etc have been sent up to Est 
court and as appeals for underclothing mattress covers etc from 
hospitalshave been attended to the above appeal from Mooi River 
appears to have been confused with the others and given awider meaning 
than Colonel Clery RAMC intended As regards the general mis 
management we may add that the RAMC has been on its trial and so 
far has not distinguished itself favourably but the reverseexcept upon 
the field where everything is splendidly managed and as Colonel Clery 
points out also at Mooi River Examples of cruel mismanagement have 
been plentiful but as there are now welcome signs of an awakening and 
as our only objfct is to obtain proper treatment at once for the sick and 
wounded we abstain at present from further irritating criticism to watch 
progress Suffice it that when official toDgues are untied after this cam 
ptign is over there are several whose experiences when related will 
cause a considerable sensation at home Hence though we may be 
silent it will be well to remember that there is a hereafter to the 
transient power of today when an account will have to be rendered for 
shortcomings now beiDg duly noted

In a Reuters telegram dated Modder River February I9th 
describing the rapid march of General Frenchs relief column 
there is the following reference of the New South Wales 
Medical Corps The New South Wales Ambulance Corps 
under Lieutenant Edwards drawn by Australian horses kept 
pace with the column and picked up many wounded They 
were complimented by the brigadier as being the first ambu

THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH BAYRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
XIV 
THE GRASS PLAINS OF SOUTH AFRICA 
THE master mind of our veteran general has no sooner been 
applied to the task in South Africa than a totally new develop 
ment has been brought about The war has entered on a new 
phase and actions are being fought in an entirely new 
country The whole of the country over which Robertss 
various columns are now manxeuvring consists of rolling grass 
plains with only here and there a few kopjes and ironstone 
ridges dotted on their surface The soil for the most part is 
sandy and is but loosely held together by grassy tufts which 
are everywhere separated from each other by considerable in 
tervals In travelling over this country waggons frequently 
strike out new paths in the untrodden veld and in places it 
is quite possible that the huge convoys of waggons each with 
i6 oxen and each carrying 6ooo pounds weight might travel 
over the veld five or six abreast The season has been excep 
tionally dry only a few thunderstorms having occurred and 
the whole veld is parched and brown In the tracks of 
waggons clouds of dust arise and may be seen for many miles 
ascending into the air marking the line of convoys across the 
plain as smoke sometimes marks in the distance the track of 
an ocean steamer 
Th het HEAT EXHAUSTION AND MENINGITIS 
The beat during the march of the different divisions appears 
to have been intense and Lord Roberts mentioned in his 
telegram of February i4th that no fewer than 44 officers and 
53 men had been sent on the 13th in return ox waggons to the 
ilne of railway prostrate with heat exhaustion Heat exhaus 
tion is a good soldiers phrase and is often described in the 
tropics by medical men as heat syncope or sun traumatism 
What the precise pathology of this attack may be it is difficult 
to say but the symptoms usually are prostration with head 
ache which usually passes off in twentyfour hours or even 
less At other times solar fever may follow for a day or two 
and in some cases of which a few have come under my notice 
meningitis is produced and terminates fatally The fatai 
cases which I have seen occurred in natives employed in the 
open workiDgs of the diamond mines with heads entirely 
uncovered and exposed to the midday sun and shut off by the 
surrounding walls of the mine from any currents of air 
Certain cases of fatal meningitis arose on the diamond fields 
under these conditions With these exceptions I have never 
seen more than a few days lassitude follow the most persistent 
exposure to the sun At the same time during periods of 
great heat acute meningitis which seemed directly traceable 
to the action of extremely high temperature sometimes 
developed among patients suffering from fever and other 
diseases The Free State plains are at an altitude of 
about 4ooo feet above the sea level and although hot 
by day they are almost always cool by night The 
summer nights on these plains are ideal for bivouack 
ing in the open with one blanket a hole in the sandc 
hollowed out for the admission of the hip and a pair of 
boots or other articles of equipment for a pillow a weary man 
THE MEDICAL SERVICE OF THE AUSTRALIAN 
CONTINGENT 
WHEN that first strange initial blunder of the War Office was 
made and the offer of an Australian contingent of all arms 
was declined it occurred to Colonel W D Campbell Williams 
of Sydney Principal Medical Officer of the Medical Corps of 
the New South Wales Military Forces that the offer of a 
medical service unit might nevertheless be accepted 
It should be explained that New South Wales is the only 
colony of Australia that possesses a thoroughly organised 
trained and equipped Medical Staff Corps This is composed 
of a small number of regulars but the bulk are partially 
paid The corps was originated by Colonel W D Campbell 
Williams and is described as  more than up to date The 
corps is able to provide for a field force of 7000 men One of 
its notable features is a cavalry ambulance the waggons 
of which were designed and built to Colonel Williamss 
plans They are for use with mounted forces in bush 
country and are able to keep up with a rapidly moving force 
A great proportion of the medical officers are either surgeons 
or physicians to civil hospitals and included in their number 
are the leading surgeons and physicians of Sydney so that it 
possesses the best medical skill of the colony The 
organisation of the corps is such that with six hours 
notice it can proceed to the front with every waggon horsed 
its own transport stretcher bearers and all stores tents 
drugs and medical comforts etc complete 
Colonel Campbell Williamss suggestion was taken up by 
the New South Wales Government and the cable message 
sent to this country was to the great gratification of the New 
South Wales Corps answered by a message that the offer was 
 gratefully accepted an instance of foresight one among 
many upon which the DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical 
Department must many times since have congratulated him 
self The message accepting the offer was received in Sydney 
on Monday and on Friday night the Army Medical Corps unit 
offered a half bearer company and a field hospital complete 
in every detail on a war establishment was embarked It 
included 93 men of all ranks 49 horses 5 ambulances Io 
transport carts and 2 water carts with all the ordnance and 
medical and surgical stores as laid down with in addition a 
fine reserve store of drugs Roentgen ray apparatus etc This 
is certainly an achievement upon which Colonel Williams is 
to be eongratulated and was rendered possible only by the 
state of preparedness in wbich the New South Wales Medical 
Staff Corps was kept and by the goodwillby whichtbeenergy 
and organisimg ability of the commanding officer was 
seconded by all concerned The medical officers who accom 
panied Colonel Williams who is Senior Surgeon St Vincents

these plains aay from the rivers is not good and not infre 
quently ten or fifteen miles occurs between one small fountain

DE ATHS FROM DISEASE 
Mt Wyndham in reply to an inquiry stated in the House 
of Commons that among combatants approximately 5o8 deaths 
from disease had occurred in South Africa 240 from enteric 
lever and 268 from other causes If we deduct from these 
losses those resulting from epidemics of typhoid fever and 
dysentery in Ladysmith it will be seen that the actual losses 
asustained by the whole of our forces cannot be described as 
great As a matter of fact the Free State has a thoroughly 
healthy climate in which our men are likely to remain fit and 
well unless quartered for long periods of time in camps where 
the water supply is insufficient and typhoid fever is allowed 
to become established 
AMBULANCE WITH IRREGULAR CORPS 
My attention has been called to the medical corps attached 
to the New South Wales contingent which is reported to have 
excellent provisions for ambulance attendance in the field 
and an inquiry has been sent me as to whether the Colonial 
forces will be similarly equipped with medical requirements 
A gentleman recently returned from Chieveley where he 
has been some time with Bullers force tells me that pro 
vision has been made for supplying surgeons to the irregular 
corps and that a considerable amount was collected among 
South Africans in London for supplementing some of the 
necessaries for such equipment My informant added that 
pyjamas were badly needed by both the Colonial forces and 
the regulars not for use in the field but for the use of wounded 
mnen brought into the field hospitals from the frout He told 
me that while he was there many such wounded were brought 
in and that after slitting up a mans khaki jacket or breeches 
as the case might be and attending to the wound there was 
considerable difficulty in getting anything to put on The 
anatter is worthy the attention of some of the numerous or 
ganisations for sending out articles of clothing for the troops 
While on the matter of clothing for the troops it is well to note 
a comment in the letter of my Capetown correspondent 
which appeared in the last issue of the BRITISH MEDICAL 
JOURNAL 
PLEURISY AND PNEUMONIA AMONG RECRUITS 
He says many cases of pleurisy and pneumonia had been ad 
mitted to the base hospitals at Capetown from men only just 
landed from the transports This is a distinctly unfortunate 
state of things and is due my correspondent thinks to the 
fact that the men were obliged to go barefooted on board ship I 
cannot believe this practice is in vogue on all troopships but 
can readily understand that the khaki cotton which many of 
the men are provided with and which I have seen them wear 
on raw December days on the docks at Southampton may 
prove a very poor protection during the first half of the voyage 
and also in the case of a southeaster off the Cape In some 
instances I am told that our men had no cloak whatever 
No troops should be sent without cloaks and for the mounted 
men there is nothing to beat the regulation blue cavalry 
cloak Blue bytheby is a better colour for this cloak than 
khaki In South Africa itself the cloak will only be worn on 
picquet duty at night or in camp Atnight the dark cloak is 
less conspicuous than the khaki would be One of the City 
Volunteers a wellknown lawyer died of pneumonia on the 
voyage out and I fear that he was a victim to insufficient 
clothing during the voyage One of the peculiarities of the 
new campaigner or amateur traveller is the passion for 
unnecessary hardship and many young fellows going out 
with the yeomanry and volunteers require a certain amount 
bf restraint to prevent them from hazarding their health by 
recklessly undergoing unnecessary exposure which they 
erroneously believe will have a hardening effect but which 
as a matter of fact actually costs at any rate a small number 
of lives 
LADYSMITH 
From Ladysmith an extremely interesting account of the 
state of affairs has recently been published by one of 
PReuters war correspondents who escaped from that town 
n February ioth Stores still seem to be fairly abundant 
but luxuries and vegetablesare at faminepiices Mr Hutton 
says that continual diet of horses and mules was getting 
somewhat monotonous Further on we read that the live 
stock still included 4ooo horses 700 mules and 650 cattle 
At first one is disposed to wonder why with 65ocattle 
men should be eating horses and mules The explanatiop 
perhaps is that the little grazing obtainable more easily keeps 
the cattle in condition than either the horses or the mules 
Cattle therefore willlast longeri and possibly in addition 
give a certain amount of milk v There is something almost 
ludicrous in the idea of mule sausage The mule has been 
described as a being who has neither pride of ancestry nor 
hope of posterity to inspire him he is a quegrtepnpered 
brute and we have not yet forgotten that he bolted with 
the guns at Nicholsons Nek Nevextheless as a vegetable 
feeder the mule should be quite eatable and apparently 
does afford at least a nourishing diet The sickness in Lady 
smith is evidently on the wane and although thecondition of 
the garrison is undoubtedly a hard one there i eFtill every 
reason to suppose that Ladysmithcan if necessry hiold its 
own for a considerable time to come for such time n fact 
as may be necessary for the pressure of Lord Robhertss 
oolumn in the Free State to compel the withdrawal of a large 
portion of the Natal Boer fQrces andthna relieve the pgg 
beleagured town In faot we may confideptly anticipate that 
if byno other means the positions round Ladysmith will be 
takenas were the positions at Magersfontein by a move 
ment which compelled the withdrawal of the forces occupying 
them 
THE SCOTTISH HOSPITAL 
IT has been decided at a public meeting held in Edinburgh tQ 
open a fund to provide and maintain a hospital for the sick 
and wounded soldiers in South Africa The leading medical 
and surgical authorities in Edinburgh are giving their cordial 
support to the scheme and are to assist in securing mecical 
officers and nurses Although the hospital will be Scottish 
in origin and equipment its services will be available for the 
sick and wounded of any nationality The object is to aid the 
Army Medical Department in its efforts to inlieve the sick and 
wounded in connection with the war We understand that the 
cost of the hospital is expectedtobe about 12000 and that a 
large part of that sum has been subscribed or promised The 
preliminary staff appointments will be made this week 
A WELSH HOSPITAL 
IT has been decided to equip a Welsh hospital and at a 
meeting held at the house of  Sir John Williams on February 
218t subscriptionS amounting to nearly iooo were announced 
A provisional Committee was elected including Sir John Wil 
liams Dr Frederick Roberts Dr Isambard Owen Mr Edmund 
Owen and Mr Thomas Jones FRCS of Manchester with 
Professor Alfred Hughes of Kings College as Organising 
Secretary Further particulars will be furnished and donar 
tions will be received by Professor Hughes at 7 Chester 
Terrace Regents Park NW 
THE PRINCESS CHRISTIAN HOSPITAL 
THIs hospital will sail from Southampton early next week 
It has been presented to the Government by Mr Alfred 
Mosely a native of Bristol This munificent gift has been 
entirely equipped and will be supported by the generous 
donor who accompanies it ito the Cape Mr Moselys know 
ledge of the country and climate gained during twentyfive 
years connection with South Africa will prove of no little 
value to the efficient working of the hospital No trouble or 
expense has been spared to make the hospital in every way 
worthy of Princess Christian who has graciously consented 
that it should bear her name Major H B Mathias DSO 
RAMC who is a brother of Colonel H H Mathias VC 
is the military medical officer in command The civil staff 
will consist of vthe following

latest improvements including a very complete Roentgen ray apparatus 
with all the apparatus for localising foreign bodies etc The accessories 
include the new mercurial interruptor for makiDg and breaking the cur

In honour of the founder and the medical staff of the 
hospital the Bristol medical students and their friends met 
at dinner at the Clifton Grand Spa on February 17th The 
dinner was well attended and was pronounced a great success 
Mr Munro Smith presided The menu was decorated with a 
humorous sketch of the Two Pauls Mr Kruger being 
represented as making a rapid strategic movement to the rear 
closely followed by Mr Paul Bash armed with a formidable 
amputating knife and pair of forceps Equally amusing was 
a topical song sungand composed we believeby Mr 
Pearce The words will probably be published later in the 
Stethoscope the organ of the Bristol Faculty of Medicine 
Mr Brsh and his colleagues bear with them the best wishes 
of their friends for a pleasant journey a successful sojourn 
and a speedy return to Bristol

command The Duke carefully inspected the men and the 
medical officers were presented to him The Duke then in a 
short speech congratulated the staff on having the oppor 
tunity of serving their Queen and country in South Africa 
Though the news recently received had been more cheering 
he still feared that there would be many occasions for them to 
render services both to the wounded and to the sick and he 
congratulated the donor of the hospital Mr John Langman 
on the noble gift which he had made to the nation Mr Lang 
man subsequently entertained the Duke of Cambridge the 
medical staff of the hospital and a party of friends to lunch

Nursing Homes Committee and has coencluded arrangements by which 
72 officers will find suitable accommodation in that island in the event 
of invalids being sent thither on their way home from the Cape 
After consultation with Dr Graham it has been decided that the 
majority of cases will at this season do well in the environs of Funchal 
where ample and most liberal provision has been made by Messrs Reid 
At a greater elevation cases demanding mountain air and altitude will 
be treated at Mr Roche MEchados wellknown quinta 2000 feet above sea 
level 
THE MIDWIVES BILL 
THE text of the Bill to Secure the Better Training of Midwives 
and to Regulate their Practice which was introdticed by lMrl 
Tatton Egerton into the House of Commons on February 2nd 
and which has been put down to second reading on February 
28th was issued by the Parliamentary Printers on February 1 7th 
and is printed below Tbe Bill has been modified in several 
material respects by its promoters the Midwives Bill Com 
mittee to bring it iito accord with the recommendations of 
the General Medical Council but otherwise it agrees with the 
Bill introduced last year 
It will be remembered that at the annual meeting of the 
British Medical Association at Portsmouth a rider to the 
report of the Council was moved by Mr George Brown 
seconded by Mr Brindley James and adopted requesting the 
Council to cause representations to be made to the Lord 
President of the Privy Council to the effect that the 
general meeting of members of the British Medical 
Association deprecated the adoption of the Bill pro 
moted by the Midwives Bill Committee in the session 
of I899 Acting upon this Dr Saundby the retiring 
President of Council wrote to the Duke of Devonshire 
and represented the strong objections there were to the Bill 
as brought into the House of Commons and praying in the 
name of the Association that the Government would take no 
steps in the mattEr without giving the British Medical Asso 
ciation an opportunity of being heard by a small deputation 
A reply was received from the Lord President ol the Council 
to the effect that the statement would have the Duke of 
Devonshires best attention This was reported to the meet 
ing of the Council in October last and referred to the Parlia 
mentary Bille Committee At the meeting of this Committee 
on January i6th it was stated that the modifications in the 
Bill which had been prepared by the Subcommittee of the 
kParliamentary Bills Committee would be brought up if and 
when a Bill was brought before the House of Commons
