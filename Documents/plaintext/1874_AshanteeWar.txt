THE ASHANTEE WAR 
FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT 
Gold Coast December 4th 
FOR the first time in the history of this Protectorate its affairsmili 
tary political and socialare being fully ventilated by means of the 
pens of the many correspondents who have cropped up during the war 
You have now ordained that its affairs medical and sanitary are to 
remain no longer dormant but be also unfolded to the general view de 
die in diem Happily the first scene in this drama of war is about to 
terminate and with it those horrors which have shocked the sensibili 
ties of humanitarians Cutting off of heads lopping off of arms and 
such like interesting performances can no longer be had recourse to 
within our territory for the enemy are in full retreat to the Prab and 
before this letter reaches England will have crossed the banks of that 
now rather celebrated river For more than ten months these savages 
have been burning enslaving and destroying until once gay villages 
have been turned into mere refuges for the many beautiful lizards which 
bask in the sun upon their now roofless walls Everywhere where 
they have passed have they left their mark and it will be years before 
the remembrance of the Ashantees will have passed away from the 
minds of the inhabitants Now that we have an opportunity for doing 
so it is most interesting to trace the progress of the Ashantee army 
from Prashu to Yaucomassie where the first general action with the 
natives took place The remains of the encampments are still to be 
seen roofless shanties of palm midribs neatly formed together which 
when covered with leaves afforded shelter from the tropical rain and 
dews so heavy in this country These little bush dwellings line the 
path to the Prah every two or three miles showing that their progress 
must have been most leisurely For a savage nation the Ashantees 
are adepts in the art of war They march in companies and divisions 
encamp and hut themselves progress in easy stages send out foragers 
or slaves for provisions and are perfectly acquainted with the ad 
vantages of ambushes shouting tomtomming and such other means 
as act upon the rather sensitive nerves of their hereditary foes Their 
ambushes are beautifully constructed of leaves and vines in the narrow 
paths from behind these they have a ready means of retreat Scouts 
occupy all the paths to their permanent encampments so that it is 
quite impossible to steal upon them unawares as often proved during 
the progress of the present expedition The care these people take of 
their instruments of war the construction of their houses and many 
other points evident in their domestic history show that although 
savages in almost every sense of the word they are still not without 
the pale of our admiration That they are endowed with physical 
courage is undoubted while the reverse of the picture may be drawn 
of the Fantees who while finely made men are the most miserable 
cowards Of the two races the coast tribes are the larger and more 
muscular As with other cognate races they have evidently become 
enervated by more intimate contact with Europeans The Ashantee 
army is made up of two distinct racesAshantees proper and Donkas 
or slaves these last without guns and perfectly naked do all the 
menial work of the camperect shelter sheds forage for plantains and 
carry their masters furniture and belongings A number of these have 
been captured nearly all in a starving condition and some with every 
bone standing prominently forward three small cuts upon each cheek 
denote their nationality These Ashantee slaves appear to be very 
little above the animal in their ideas and feelings  food is devoured with 
avidity and the unfortunate wretch who tries in the struggle to con 
ceal a dainty morsel when discovered is belaboured most unmercifully 
Appearing to have no animosity towards the white man they all tell the 
same story of want of powder food disease and death It is an un 
doubted fact that smallpox dysentery bronchitis and starvation have 
here been making sad ravages This can be easily understood for they 
have no idea of vaccination and when one of their number is afflicted 
with variola he is hutted in the bush and left to die or allowedto roam 
about amongst them The dearth of proper food and consequent neces 
sityof falling back upon unripeplantains bananas pineapples pawpaws 
and the wild or bitter yam are no doubt the principal causes of the dysen 
teric attacks from which they suffer Exposure to vicissitudes of tem 
perature and wet drinking of impure surfacewater largely impregnated 
with albuminous and decaying vegetable matter must also contribute to 
the production of the disease The odour and nature of the faecal ac 
cumulations which cover their camps sufficiently indicate the prevalence 
of this affection amongst them Their sick and wounded they nearly 
always remove either upon mens backs or in baskets roughly made 
from the midrib of the palmleavesa not very uncomfortable means of 
transport All the chiefs and men of influence crossed the Prah with 
a number of slaves many of these have died during the past eight 
months One prisoner related that his master crossed with twentyfour 
and only two remained another on being asked why he deserted 
replied that  as his master had died during the campaign he was 
afraid to return to Coomassie as his head would be taken off in order 
to allow of his at once leaving for the world of spirits to there resume his 
menial capacity and former servitudea condition of affairs to which 
he strongly and very naturally objected These Ashantee gentlemen 
have not forgotten the attractions of female society in their wanderings 
Amenquachie the generalinchief is credited with no fewer than eight 
wives who are carefully housed in camp in his own particular quad 
rangle A chiefs hut may be always known by this peculiar arrange 
ment of the building  the shelterhuts are better made and face each 
other in the form of a hollow square Here the palavers are held the 
voice of the solitary speaker and the round of applause which follows 
upon his stirring words have been frequently heard from our advanced 
posts which are close upon those of the enemy A few female slaves 
have been capturedall as wretched as the men One in rather better 
condition surrendered herself not long sincea Crepi When asked why 
she deserted herlord and master she replied Well I was taken as a slave 
from my own country to Coomassie a year and a half ago enceinte and 
there delivered of a babyboy Since then no one has admired me so 
I have left them upon the first opportunity Her goodhumoured face 
grinned from ear to ear We all naturally laughed at such a pretty 
speech It is to be hoped the fair dame has regained already her lost 
love The Ashantees have some peculiar modes of burying their dead 
Only free men are honoured with burial  the unfortunate slaves are left 
in the bush  higher chiefs are placed upon elevated biers wrapped up 
in their clothes and covered with leaves there to remain until decom 
position and ants clean the bones these last are then collected on the 
return journey and brought back to Coomassie We have seen several 
of these in the forest and the odour from them is anything but 
agreeable An Ashantee warrior is after all a picture to look at  his 
clothes a loincloth over which are buckled the leather bandalier and 
bags containing his ammunition a formidable knife stuck in this girdle 
and a long flint musket with a few amulets complete the tout ensemble 
of his military furniture Such is the savage soldier who has given us 
so much trouble and spilled some of our best blood Wellknit lithe 
active he is perfectly capable of giving us plenty of trouble yet and it 
is folly to suppose that our march to Coomassie will be a bloodless one 
The wounded in the coming campaign will not be among the least of 
its difficulties after we have crossed the Prah Such then are the 
Ashantees as we have seen them during the past few months You can 
judge for yourself whether our enemies are to be despised 
I have thought it best to commence my letter with this brief account 
of the Ashantee army as much of what I have written must be new to 
your readers 
By the latest accounts the enemy were encamped near Faysoo some 
twentyfour miles from the River Prahslowly and leisurely retreating 
in three divisions Their rearguard was come up with on the Ist in 
stant attacked and driven upon the main body In this attack we lost 
one Houssa killed and four men of the 2nd West India Regiment were 
wounded someof the irregular troops were also touched up These 
last it is whispered were mindful of the old adage on this particular 
occasion 
He who fights and runs away 
May live to fight another day 
Sir Garnet Wolseley the AdjutantGeneralMajor Baker Captain 
Laniyon Aidedecamp and the principal medical officer left for the 
front on the Ist instant on a flying visit of inspection Fifty blue jackets 
accompanied the General Sixty miles of the road are now open and 
it is being pushed on with vigour under the superintendence of Major 
Home RE The insecurity of the road has hitherto been one of 
our great drawbacks now stores of all kinds are being pushed on to 
the first base of operationsMansueuntil the station on the Prah or 
in its immediate vicinity has been determined upon so that one meets 
on the road nothing but a long line of carriers of ammunition biscuit 
preserved meat rum rice tea sugar and other luxuries too numerous 
to mention Now and then a hospitalbath or one of Fyffes patent 
close stools is observed in the distancean indication that war has to 
be looked upon in quite another aspect and that honour and glory are 
after all only the bright side of the picture 
According as the outposts are being advanced temporary hos 
pitals are established That of the headquarters of the 2nd West 
India Regiment is at present established at Mansue These are eva 
cuated of their sick as quickly as possible Cape Coast has conse 
quently become one large hospital At Connors Hill are located the 
Marines of whom twentyeight are on the sicklist chiefly suffering 
from attacks of dysentery and fever the latter disease predominating 
The form is the usual Coast remittent or eightday fever I must defer

to a future letter a description of this disease Here also an officers 
hospital has been opened and at Cape Coast is the garrison hospital 
chiefly occupied by men of the 2nd West India Regiment of whom 
some forty are under treatment Quite recently the church has been 
equipped for twentytwo patients and is now available for its future 
sick population 
Twelve men of the Army Hospital Corps arrived by the mail of the 
3rd instant two of whom are compounders One of the latter has 
been told off for duty at Connors Hill the other joins the head 
quarters of the 2nd West at present in charge of Surgeon Thornton 
at Mansue The men of the Army Hospital Corps have hitherto be 
haved themselves very well Sergeant Mabony one of the earlier 
arrivals Sergeant Edwards HospitalSergeant iooth Regiment and 
Sergeant Ronchier have done very good work since their arrival 
The men are endeavouring to do their best and in such a trying 
climate they deserve every consideration 
1f SurgeonMajor Reade arrived by the mail of the 30h ult and Mr 
Waters by the succeeding one for Sierra Leone Drs MNaltey Ley 
Horton and Moore are the other officers at headquarters The last 
officer has had a most severe attack of dysentery which in all proba 
bility will necessitate a chance to England The disease was con 
tracted at Bala a camp now abandoned Dr Yore Sanitary Officer 
has returned from Acrofroom and resumed his duty on the staff of the 
QuartermasterGeneral SurgeonMajor Jackson has left in the 
Simoom for Ascension for a change We are consequently at present 
without a hospital ship and anxiously looking out for the arrival of 
the Victor Emtmanutel A change of vessels will be of advantage as 
owing to the prolonged period of her stay here the Simnooi was be 
coming rather unhealthy It should be remembered that hulks cannot 
with safety to their inmate3 remain anchored for any lenath of time in 
the waters of the Coast of Africa Every one praises the Simoomn the 
courtesy of her medical officers and the liberality of the treatment of 
the sick Fresh provisions were instantly supplied and everything 
conducive to the care and comfort of those labouring under the symp 
toms of disease 
The rains at Cape Coast are not yet finished We had a regular 
downpour on the Ist Up country afternoon rains and thunderstorms 
still continue these are accompanied by vivid lightningindications 
that the African monsoon is drawing to its close In the interval the 
cool seabreeze blows regularly and the heat in the shade is not ex 
cessive Up country one scarcely feels the seabreeze although many 
of the stations are elevated some hundred feet above the level of 
the sea 
Lieutenant Grey of the Royal Marines was buried on the Ist instant 
with military honours he died of dysentery the day previous This is 
the third officer who has died since the arrival of Sir Garnet WVolseley 
Eardley Wilmot killed at Danquah Harry Mouat of the Commis 
sariat and the last mentioned officer Poor fellows  they lie side by 
side in the European cemetery near the Salt Pond The town and its 
immediate vicinity are at present comparatively healthy The executive 
officers of the Sanitary Commission have been working vigorously and 
in time Cape Coast will present a very different appearance The 
number of tumbledown houses is a great drawback as they impede 
ventilation and allow of accumulation of filth At present this must 
remain unfortunately as the legal rights of owners cannot be lightly 
interfered with I must defer to a future letter many points of sanitary 
and medical interest

its claims 
CommunicationzsThe following communications were made 
I Soft Cancer of the KidneyDr RUSSELL presented a large 
tumour of soft cancer weighing between ten and eleven pounds origin 
ating in the left kidney and nearly destroying that organ extending to 
the neighbouring glands which constituted the main mass and occa 
sioning secondary deposits in the liver and on the pleura The patient 
was below middle age The history of the tumour did not extend be 
yond four months The tumour increased with great rapidity pro 
ducing great oedema of the lower extremity and of the penis Death 
occurred in three weeks suddenly from effusion in both pleurae doubt 
less from partial compression of the abdominal vena cava There was 
entire absence of cachexia specially remarkable considering the rapid 
growth of the tumour 
2 Anencephalous FaetusDr MALINS showed an anencephalous 
foetus having also a deficiency in the posterior arches of the first three 
or four dorsal vertebrx It occurred in the practice of Dr Thompson 
of Kingswinford  its main interest being in the fact that it was the off 
spring of an idiot girl an unmarried inmate of the workhouse 
3 Ovarian TumourMr EBBAGE showed an ovarian tumour re 
moved after death from a maiden lady aged 85 The chief inconveni 
ence caused during life was cedema of the extremities The tumour 
filled the pelvis and was firmly fixed by fibrous bands to the uterus 
The tumour was in parts of bony hardness It was referred for exa 
mination to the Pathological Section 
4 Fibromta of the UterusMr BARTLEET exhibited a fibroma uteri 
removed the previous day by the ecraseur Tinted microscopic speci 
mens of the growth kindly prepared by Dr Malins were placed on 
the table 
5 Mr SAMPSON GAMGEE read notes on Esmarchs Bandages for 
Bloodless Operations and Mr BOND MOORE a paper on the Con 
nexion between Sewagepoisoning and Typhoid Fever Each papes 
was followed by an interesting discussion 
BIRMINGHAM AND MIDLAND COUNTIES BRANCH 
MICROSCOPICAL SECTION 
A MEETING of the Section took place in Queens College Birming 
ham December gth Dr WADE in the Chair 
The Optic Nerves and Chiasma Mr PRIESTLEY SMITH read a paper 
on this subject and referred to recent articles in the Archiv fur Op 
thalmologie which seemed to establish a total decussation of the optic 
tracts in the chiasma and also the accepted belief in a semidecussa 
tion The settling of this great question would be of great importance 
in connection with hemiopia as a means of localising brainlesion The 
subvaginal space existing between the inner and outer sheaths of the 
optic nerve was described in its important relation to the conditions 
known as  choked disc and staphyloma posticum The paper wae 
illustrated by diagrams explaining the different theories of the causa 
tion of hemiopia and by a number of sections of the chiasma and 
trunk of the optic nerve showing the normal structure and the changes 
produced by inflammation and atrophy 
Epiphytic Growths oJ the SkinDr CARTER contributed a paper on 
this subject illustrated by specimens of tinea tonsurans tinea circi 
natus and tinea sycosis and gave some instructions also for obtaining
