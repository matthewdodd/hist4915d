On June 20th a number of Liverpool medical men who have 
served as civilian surgeons with the forces in South Africa 
were entertained at dinner in the Exchange Station Hotel by 
the members of the profession in Liverpool The chair was 
occupied by Mr Edgar Browne President of the Medical In 
stitution and the vicechair by Sir William M Banks The 
guests were Mr J M Aldred Mr T T Bark Mr W B 
Bennett Dr R Craig Dun Mr A M Dodd Mr Arthur 
Evans Mr T H Moyles Mr J Owen Mr E Roberts Mr 
Arthur Walker and Mr J H Willett Amongst those 
present were Sir Edward Russell and there was a large and 
representative gathering of the members of the profession in 
the City and the neighbourhood After the customary loyal toasts had been honoured the Chairman proposed the health 
of the guests and said that owing to their having 
only civilian rank they had been allowed to return 
to this country without receiving any public acknow 
ledgment  but their professional brethren were of opinion 
that their success in the field merited as much recognition as 
though there were no such thing as red tape  that evening 
they were delighted to honour the patriotism and selfsacrifice 
which had cost one of themDr Edgar Smithhis life 
They at least would never forget what these gentlemen had 
done for their country and for their profession 
Dr Craig Dun who responded said that when he offered 
his services to the War Office he had an interview with an 
official of the Army Medical Department who showed him 
the names of between 800 and 900 other medical volunteers 
and told him that the War Office might perhaps accept the 
services of three or four Soon afterwards the order was 
issued to raise twelve regiments of Yeomanry He heard 
nothing further for six weeks and had dismissed the matter 
from his mind when he received a telegram one Friday night 
telling him he had been appointed medical officer to the 2nd 
Regiment of Yeomanry with the temporary rank of captain 
and that he must sail on the following Tuesday He went to 
London and saw the same official as to the medical equip 
ment of his regiment He was told that he must 
 
requisition 
for it He did not then knor what a requisition meant 
The result was that in spite of every effort he had to sail with 
1550 officers and men but without either a drug or a bandage 
Thanks to the better medical arrangements of the navy he 
found what was necessary for the voyage out on the transport 
At Capetown the difficulty as to getting medical equipment 
for the corp3 again cropped up He was told that tnough 
the regiment was ordered to the front there were no medical 
or surgical necessaries available for it However by dint of 
the exertion of influence he eventually got an equipment 
which to judge by the age of the drugs had been out in the 
Crimea It was plain that the War Office might have ap 
pointed the surgeons for the yeomanry regiments at the time 
the order to raise them was given so that the medical equip 
ment might have been obtained The fact that the regiment 
must go to the front without medical equipment did not 
seem to impress the official concerned at Capetown On 
arriving at De Aar he found a hospital staff and equipment 
for oigaty men Soon afterwards they had to deal with 245 
patients nearly all too severely wounded to be sent down to 
Capetown Subsequently his corps went up the country with 
Lord Kitchener and were in action They had seventy 
casualties The dressings gave out in 48 hours and they 
had to tear up the sheets commandeered from Boer farm 
houses Three months afterwards he was back at De Aar 
and he found that the state of unpreparedness was precisely 
the same as before When he arrived at Bloemfontein the stress 
of work was over and the hospitals were doing fairly well At 
Kroonstad there were three hospitals one civil and two mili 
tary One civil and one military hospital were perfect In 
the second military hospitalin the churchthe men were 
lying on their mackintoshes covered only with blankets and 
without either sheets or pyjamas That could not be 
accounted for by the exigencies of war At Pretoria there was 
an excellent Irish civil hospital in the Law Courts As to the 
field hospitals they were splendidly equipped 
for the work 
they had to do according to the army regulations but not for 
dealing with enteric and dysentery patients as well as with 
wounded Besides the sick had to subsist on bullybeef and 
biscuit Were these things the fault of the system or of the 
men  He had no hesitation in saying they were wholly the 
fault of the system The Army Medical Corps had done splen 
did work under the greatest possible difficulties In the face 
of the existing regulations he could not honestly advise any 
graduate in medicine to look to service in the army as a fair 
field for his activity In concluding Dr Dun made one or 
two suggestions At present promotion in the Army Corps he 
paid depended not on professional ability but on a mans 
filling in his return sheets accurately The medical men at 
the front spent a great deal of their time filling up return 
sheets He would relegate this clerical work to noncommis 
sioned officers He also advocated a return to the old system 
of regimental doctors 
The annual report of the Royal Infirmary for the year 1900 
shows a deficit of 2800 There is a constant tendency to 
increased expenditure the increased price of coal alone in 
volving an addition of 200 to the years outlay As the 
Treasurer observes in his report however if the institution 
is to keep pace with the constant advance in surgical and 
medical requirements such as in the interests of the com 
munity the Committee maintains to be the just function of a 
firotclass teaching hospital this cannot be otherwise The 
annual reports of the Medical Surgical and Pathological 
Registrars of the same institution have also been published 
constituting the fifth yearly issue The volume contains 
twelve pages more than the issue of last year These reports 
represent a vast amount of labour in analysing and tabulat 
ing cases and will doubtless be found of great value by 
clinical and pathological investigators 
The Committee of the Epileptic Home at Maghull in their 
twelfth annual report presented to the annual meeting held 
recently state that the general health of the patients apart 
from their special ailment has been very satisfactory Dur 
I ing the year 21 patients have been discharged and 3 have 
died and on December 31st there remained in the home 69 
males and 54 females Land has been purchased for the 
purpose of erecting a villa for firstclass patients and to pro 
vide accommodation for the nursing staff of the male home 
The building roads and drainage are estimated to cost in all 
5500 towards which the Committee have funds in hand or 
promised amounting to 3500 leaving an amount of 2000 
still to be provided A friend has generously promised 500 
towards the cost of furnishing the villa and another friend 
has intimated her willingness to furnish a suite of rooms 
An attempt is being made to secure a suitable farm on which 
patients can be employed for wages The medical report 
states that there are epileptics in the home who can plough 
hoe reap milk cows and perform household duties  in fact 
the homes are blocked by these trained cases who occupy the 
ground necessary for developing the faculties of the new 
patients Mr A L Jone in moving that the report and 
the treasurers statement be adopted said that he felt the 
greatest sympathy with the efforts of the Committee and 
that he believed they wanted something like 
10000 
to carry 
out the work properly He would consider it a very great 
pleasure to contribute 1000 provided they got the whole 
sum required within say six months Subsequently an 
exhibition of the patients work was inspected with interest 
by those present
