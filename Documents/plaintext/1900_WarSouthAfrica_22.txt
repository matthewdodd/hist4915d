THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY 
HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
FRoM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT 
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON SMALLCALIBRE 
BULLET WOUNDS 
TEIE HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG 
DURING my stay at Capetown I had an opportunity of seeing 
Nos I and 2 General Hospitals established at Wynberg in 
full work A large number of wounded and a fewremark 
ably fewsick had been brought down from the field hospitals 
at the Modder River and Orange River and the staff were 
busily engaged Later on some i8o were brought in the 
hospital ship Spartan from Natal and accommodated at No 3 
General Hospital at Rondebosch the officers being taken into 
the permanent hospital forming part of No I There is no 
need for me to describe the hospitals as your readers have 
already had fall accounts of them but a few impressions 
derived from a study of the cases may prove of interest 
Through the courtesy of Colonel Anthonisz Colonel Duke 
and Colonel Wood in charge respectively of the three 
hospitals I was enabled to study the cases minutely and the 
RAMC officers and civil surgeons vied with each other in 
drawing attention to all the more remarkable cases It is of 
course early to speak positively about patients who have only 
been a short time under treatment but the general impression 
of their progress is decidedly favourable The sanitary effi 
ciency of both hospitals is so far unquestionable and the water 
supply good and abundant At present the dry season is 
firmly established and the doors and windows everywhere in 
huts and tents alike are perpetually open to an extent indeed 
that at first rather amazes those unaccustomed to the climate 
and unaware of the slight risk that appears to be incurred by 
operating on patients and dressing wQunds almost in the open 
air 
Wounds inflicted by the Mauser bullet heal very kindly as 
favourably indeed as we are assured by those who ought to 
know do wounds caused by the LeeMetford If a Mauser 
bullet has merely inflicted a flesh wound through the shoulder 
arm or thigh healing throughout by primary union can with 
certainty be looked for It is uncommon to find any portions 
of clothing buttons etc carried into the wound In some 
cases however this does happen and I was assured that in 
not a few that came under treatment at the field hospitals at 
the Modder River portions of the Highlanders kilts were 
embeceded in the wounds and were removed 
WOUNDS BY THE SPORTING MAUSER  BWLLET AND BY 
RICOCHET 
The vast majority of the wounds are inflicted by the Mauser 
bullet properthat is the familiar conical bullet sheathed 
completely in nickel But wounds inflicted in our men by 
three other kinds of bullets have to be taken into account 
The sporting Mauser bullet is of the same size and weight 
as the other but the nickel does not entirely enclose the lead 
being deficient at the fore part for about half an inch The 
posterior point of the lead bullet being enclosed and tightly 
gripped in its nickel sheath the lead on striking any hard sub 
stancebone for examplespreads out or  mushrooms as 
it is usually expressed This involves much laceration of 
soft parts There is yet a bullet occasionally used which is 
practically identical with the  Dumdum and in a very few 
instances the ordinary  Express  bullet has been extracted 
To this list shouldbe added the Mauser bullet as aricochet shot 
Not many of these are met with Some that I have seen show 
bending of the bullet or it may be twisted on its long axis 
The nickel top may be intact but the nickel sheath will pro 
bably be split and stripped off the lead core to a greater or 
less extent se that the bullet resembles a moth with closely 
folded wings Such missiles would be likely to deflect in their 
course and they would obviously lacerate ttie parts through 
which they passed An intact Mauser bullet nearly spent 
may be twisted and bent and the nickel sheath split in a 
somewhat similar fashion if it strikes a hard bone In such 
cases the entrance wound is small and there is probably no 
exit wound thus showing that the bullet was of normal shape 
when entering 
SHELL AND SHRAPNEL WOUNDS 
A few of the patients have injuries from shell splinters one 
or two injuries from the i I6 Nordenfelt projectile and once in 
a way wounds inflicted by shrapnel are met with 
THE SMALL PROPORTION OF SEPTIC CASES 
It must be borne in mind that all the patients in the base 
hospitals have travelled far When fit to be sent down from the 
field hospitals in the western frontier or when the pressure 
necessitated their being moved away they had a journey of 
at least twentyeight hours in the hospital train to Wynberg 
then the drive up to the base hospital is about a mile 
Wounded sent down from Natal have their journey to Durban 
and then the transit in the hospital ship to Capetown After 
that they have about half an hours journey by train from the 
docks to Wynberg or Rondebosch followed in either case by a 
drive of about one mile If the conditions therefore are con 
sidered and it be remembered that many of the men had 
lain for hours on the field of battle before the ubiquitous 
bearer companies had access to them it is not surprising that 
in a few cases the wounds had become septic before they 
reached Wynberg Once there however and at rest the 
septic condition as a rule rapidly mended At one time dur 
ing my stay at Capetown there were about Iioo patients in 
hospital The proportion of septic cases was marvellously 
insignificant 
THE SURGICAL WORK AT THE FRONT 
The mere mention of septicity seems to imply criticism if 
not censure Nothing could be further from justice The 
plain fact is that one and all are agreed that never perhaps in 
the history of warfare has better work been done at the front 
by the Medical Department than in this campaign The 
bearer companies and ambulance department have already 
received the praise so well their due I desire to bear witness 
also to the evidence of the excellent surgical work done at the 
front examples in proof of which will be cited later on 
NATURE OF WOUNDS IN RELATION TO THE NATURE OF THE 
FIGHT 
It is noteworthy that the different engagements were to a 
considerable extent characterised by particular classes of in 
juries Thus at the action of Belmont when our troops were 
for a great part of the fighting hours on their feet the cases of 
wounds of the trunk and in particular of compound fracture 
of the thigh were numerous At Magersfontein especially 
wounds of the head and shoulder and long tracking wounds 
were in the ascendant These facts seem to imply not only 
good shooting on the part of the Boers but also opportunity 
for deliberate aim Wounds about the shoulder usually 
the left were common and I saw quite a number where the 
bullet had entered near the acromion process and passed out 
through the axilla Many of these were complicated with 
nerve injury and of much interest and I shall write more at 
length on them in my next letter 
WOUND OF KNEE BY LEEENFIELD BULLET CONVALESCENCE 
FRESH INJURIES AMPUTATION 
The following are the notes of a case in which a Lee 
Enfield bullet wound of the kneejoint appeared likely to do 
well when an accident altered the progre s of the case very 
much for the worse 
The patient was a field cornet wounded at Elandslaagte by 
a LeeEnfield bullet and taken prisoner It entered the left 
popliteal space and passed out through the patella fracturing 
that bone transversely about the middle The wound did 
well and he was sent round to Capetown and moved to No I 
Hospital at Wynberg He was a big heavy man weighing 
probably i6st or i7st but not very healthylooking in fact 
his appearance rather suggested renal disease and the action 
of the heart was feeble Wiring the patella was suggested 
but not performed He recovered sufficiently with a movable 
kneejoint to leave his bed and to move about on crutches 
One day however he fell tearing the anterior wound open 
Extravasation occurred into the knee and suppuration 
follwed When I saw him about December 22nd

openings had been made in various places about the joint 
and there was cedema of the back of the thigh The knee was 
flexed and acutely painful He was very hysterical and 
though at first afraid of chloroform would not afterwards 
allow the dressings to be changed without an ansesthetic 
The temperature was irregular high and obviously septic 
He has wasted having probably 10st 35t or 48t in weight 
About December 24th the kneejoint was freely laid open 
and irrigated commencing erosion of cartilages was observed 
The temperature improved for a few days but then began to 
rise and grow irregular again He asked for amputation and 
this was done by Mr Makins about December 27th in the 
middle third of the thigh The afterprogress was satisfac 
tory and the prospect of rapid recovery almost certain 
SOME IMPRESSIONS OF MILITARY SURGERY IN 
SOUTH AFRICA 
By G H MAKINS FRCS 
ConsultingSurgeon to the Forces in South Africa 
ITHE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THE WOUNDS INFLICTED BY 
THE MAUSER RIFLE 
WOUNDS inflicted by the Mauser rifle possess very special 
characteristics due in part to the velocity attained by in part 
to the smallness of the bullet These characteristics are in a 
great measure shared by the wounds produced by the Lee 
Metford but the slightly greater size and weight together 
with the blunter extremity of the Lee Metford bullet give 
rise to a slightly more serious injury than that resulting from 
the regulation Mauser In all essentials however the 
wounds produced by the two rifles may be regarded as identi 
cal in nature 
The first striking physical peculiarity is the direct course of 
the wound track due to the fact that the bullet by reason of 
its small size and the great velocity at which it travels is 
never materially diverted in its course through the body 
indeed there is no reason why the entire length of the body 
should not be traversed by a bullet fired from a short dis 
tance The question of a wound track travelling around the 
wall of the thorax or abdomen has scarcely to be considered 
The same conditions responsible for the directness and length of 
the tracks naturally explain the frequently multiple character 
of the visceral injuries sustained fcr example lung stomach 
liver neck thorax and abdomen and the common infliction 
of two or more separate tracks by one bullet for example arm 
and forearm with the elbow in a flexed position both lower 
extremities head and trunk or one upper extremity and 
trunk 
The direction of the traek is naturally dependent on the 
position of the body at the time of thie reception of the injury 
and the frequent assumption of the prone position in the pre 
sent campaign has led to the occurrence of a large proportion 
of longitudinal tracks in the trunk or trunk and head which 
will be referred to later Certain battles in fact have been 
characterised by the nature of the wouinds sustained thus at 
Belmont and Graspan wlhere rapid advances were made in 
the erect position fractured thighs were particularly numer 
ous while at Modder River where the men for a great part 
of the time lay on the battlefield in the prone position glanc 
ing wounds of the upliftedl head or longitudinal tracks of the 
trunk and limbs were especially frequent 
Secondly the tracks are of very small calibre and hence 
produce remarkable itndividual iijuries of narrow structures 
such as nerves and vessels to he lNter remarked upon while 
on the other hand the force o t he bullet seems to be mainly 
exerted on the tissues immediately before it so that only the 
area of tissue immediately surrounding the track is condensed 
as well as contused and vital structures lying but a very short 
distance away escaped any serious injury in a most surprising 
manner 
Thirdly the apertures of entry and exit are extremely 
small and in uncomplicated wound of the soft parts often 
differ little in appearance Tet apertures however prasent 
considerable variations in character according to the angle at 
which the bullet impinges upi Qi the surface or if the bullet 
has been deformed by strih in against some hard substance 
before entering the body or again the distal portion of the 
track and the wound of exit are materially modified when the 
bullet strikes a bone in its course 
When the bullet impinges on the surface at approximately a 
right angle the aperture of entry is circular and clean punched 
out about a third of an inch in diameter and the margin is 
slightly depressed and contused The exit opening is usually 
more slitlike and the surrounding contusion less marked the 
size in uncomplicated cases not exceeding that of the aperture 
of entry and there is rarely any appearance of starring 
When the bullet impinges obliquely the aperture of entry 
is oval that side of the entrance hole on which the bullet has 
rested sloping down in a shelving manner to the track when 
such openings are supported by a firm floor as the chest wall 
or a bone they are often of considerable size 
The most important modifications in the nature of the aper 
tures in cases uncomplicated by bone injury are due to altera 
tions in the shape of the bullet consequent on its striking 
against a stone or some hard substance prior to entering the 
body 
In some instances the bullet is simply bent or curved in 
others it is shortened the unbroken sheath forming folds on 
the shortened lead core in others the casing is torn or broken 
forming a ragged envelope projecting more or less widely 
Several variations of the last condition occur thus i the 
bullet may simply have the casing broken from the tip and be 
little altered it has been suggested that this may in some 
instances have been done by the soldier before firing 
with a view to the production of explosive effects 2 The 
broken casing may be rolled back so as to form an irregular 
fringe and this condition may reach such a degree that after 
entering the body the leaden core may entirely escape from 
the case and travel onwards leaving the jagged case entangled 
in the deep part of the track 3 The casing may be fissured 
longitudinally the broken portion projecting from the side of 
the bullet like a knife edge 
In either of the latter instances the apertures both of entry 
and exit lose all special characteristics they are large and 
irregular and the wound track is modified in a corresponding 
degree 
MEDICAL NEWS AND NEEDS IN NATAL 
FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT 
Pietermaritzburg Natal January 12th 
FIjIE AT A HOSPITAL AT MARI ZBURG 
A SOMEWHAT serious fire occur ed on the eveniing of January 
8th at the Lower Barrack Hospital at Maritzburg Two wards 
containing 50 beds were completely burntt out The building 
was of the usual type of wood and galvanised iron Fortu 
nately the patieits were got out smarr ly aril no harm what 
ever has resulted to a y of them The lual papers stated 
that the wards were unocupied at the time this is incorrect 
Some of the bedsteads w re lost Had there buen a strong 
wind blrwing the extiunsi jn of the fire would only with diffi 
culty have been preveited for although there is a fire station 
within two hundred yards the fire hose could not be got to 
work owing to lack of water until the huts were destroyed 
There were plenty of empty beds in other parts of the hospital 
and no serious inconvenience was oceasioned The result of 
inquiry as to the cause has not been made known but the fire 
as usual is ascribed to the upsetting of a lamp 
THE GARRISON CHURCH AS A HOSPITAL 
Steps are now being taken to convert the garrison church 
into a hospital The buildiig will accomnmodate 5o or 6o beds 
It is doubtful whether chirch buildings are ever in a warm 
climate well adapted for hospital purposes The ventilation 
is not good the windows beirng placed high and not opening 
freely enough and there is no tlhrough current of air Nor 
is the light all that could be desired Moreover it is a dis 
tinct disadvantage to mass so large a number of sick or 
wounded in one ward TentDs are only in use in the College 
Hospital at MaritzWurg So far the rainifall has beenunusually 
light for the rairny seasou 1lere but doubtless during the 
summer montlhs in Natal wheie trenensdous downpours of 
rain are as a rule friequenlt hospital patients would be better 
off in huts The progves of woundls here speaking generally 
is as satisfactory as could possibly be wished

CONVALESCENT HOMES FOR OFFIcERS 
There would seem to be a good opening for more convalescent 
homes for wounded officers but apparently the necessary 
lnnds are not forthcoming Should any pressure occur the 
supply of beds for officers will hardly be adequate At pre 
sent the only convalescent hospital for officers is that under 
the management of Mrs Gunning and Mrs Graham which 
accommodates but 6 Another similar institution to take Io 
or 12 is talked of but not yet established and if started it 
will be by private enterprise The officers are exceedingly 
keen to get back to the front the moment they are pronounced 
well enough and itis to be feared that in some instances their 
chance may be lost owing to the necessity of providing a suffi 
ciency of hospital beds and the absence of suitable provision 
for cases not well enough to return to duty and yet too far 
advanced in convalescence to justify detention in hospital 
THE HOSPITAL SHIP NUBIA 
By GEORGE ASHTON MBVict 
Surgeon P and 0 F N Co 
CONVERSION FROM A TRANSPORT 
THE conversion of the ss Spartan from an ordinary passenger 
ship into a hospital ship with accommodation for 130 patients 
in Southampton last October elicited favourable comments 
from the home papers However in the fittingup of the 
transport Nubia for hospital purposes in Durban with accom 
modation for nearly 500 patients it may fairly be claimed that 
this young colony has shown its aged parent  how the thing 
ought to be done The ss Nubia belongs to the Peninsular 
and Oriental Steam Navigation Company She is 430 feet 
long 49 feet broad and her registered tonnage is 5914 She 
has a sea speed of 14 knots The Nubia was engaged last sum 
mer in the conveyance of the companys mails to China but 
in October she was chartered as a traDsport and brought the 
Scots Guards to the Cape She then proceeded to Durban 
where she will remain until the present campaign is over 
THE WORK OF EIGHT DAYS 
On December 25th 1899 a telegram was received by the 
naval authorities from the General Officer Commanding the 
Forces in Natal requesting them to select and fit up a large 
steamer as a hospital ship with all possible speed On the 
following day the Nubia was inepected aDd being deemed 
suitable 139 carpenters plumbrrs painters and electricians 
most of whom were refugees froml the Transvaal were at once 
placed on board By working day and night the ships whole 
aspect was changed and her interior completely rearranged 
and in eight days she was converted into a floating hospital 
replete in every detail and was ready for the reception of 
patients on January 4th The Nubia had been fitted for the 
carrying of 2000 troops and this entailed an additional 
amount of iabour as all the extensive troop fittings had to be 
removed ere the work could be begun It speaks well for the 
resources of Durban and for the energy of those to whom the 
work was entrusted that the change was completed in eight 
days as the magnitude of the task will be fully appreciated 
when it is known that every fitting every cot etc had to be 
procured or constructed locally 
THE WARDS 
Altogether there is accommodation for 474 sick wounded 
or convalescent patients These are distributed into seven 
wards iiartied A to G beginning in the fore part of the ship 
with Ward A and finishing in the stern with Ward G 
A Ward contains IOO convalescents B 26 cot cases C 32 cot 
eases D 200 convalescents E 28 cot cases F 30 cot cases 
G 30 cot cases whilst 28 cornvalescent officers have the use of 
the passengers cabins in which only the lower berths will be 
used the upper ones having been removed to make more 
room The convalescent men will sleep in hammocks The 
wards are all between decks and can be completely separated 
from one another by closing the watertight doors In Wards 
F and G which will be used for the most serious cases swing 
ing cots are provided so that when the ship proceeds to sea 
the motion will be reduced to a minimum thereby conducing 
to the comfort of these patients The ward floors have all 
been varnished and the sides matchboarded and painted 
white which adds an air of brightness and cleanliness to 
their appearance The vessel throughout is ventilated by 
steam ventilators and electric fans as a result the wards are 
always delightfully fresh and cool even in the middle of the 
day when the heat is sometimes oppressive 
THE OPERATING THEATRE AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES 
The operating theatre is situated on the main deck aft and 
is provided with all the latest appliances for the proper 
pursuit of antiseptic surgery Further aft still a mortuary is 
situated where postmortem examinations will be conducted 
and the plentiful supply of fresh water which is so necessary 
has been provided The dispensary is attached to Ward E 
and a washhouse and laundry are situated on the main deck 
amidships The approaches to the wards from the upper decks 
have been made easier and more adapted to the needs of 
invalids by having the steps broader and less perpendicular 
than is usual on board a ship Two lifts have also been fitted 
for the use of helpless patients They are worked by hand 
and are so contrived as to be free from jerking 
THE STAFF 
The medical staff consist of 6 doctors 7 nursing sisters and 
35 attendants A guard of io marines and a corporal are at 
tached they are from HMS Terrible stationed here and 
their duties consist in keeping sentry at the gangway seeing 
that due order and discipline are maintained and that no 
convalescents leave the ship without permission During 
the conversion of the ship Sir William Mac Cormac paid a 
visit He expressed his satisfaction with the excellence of 
the work and gave several hints and suggestions 
CONFORTS FOR THE PATIENTS 
The ladies of Durban came forward with their usual muni 
ficence and supplied numbers of deck chairs small tables 
and screens as well as many hanging ferns and palms the8e 
enormously enhance the general comfort and cheerful aspect 
of the wards Every day baskets of flowers and fruit together 
with bundles of newspaper and illustrated periodicals arrive 
These contributions show that Tommy has won a large circle 
of sympathetic friends who are only too pleased to avail them 
selves of this opportunity to tender him a token of their 
appreciation 
CLIMATE 
The patients will be brought down from the base hospitals 
at Maritzburg and Frere and will travel in trains specially 
fitted up for the purpose These trains are made conspicuous 
by having the Red Cross painted on the carriages The 
soldiers will be kept on board until able to resume their 
duties at the front or if incapacitated from further service 
they will be sent home when they are fit to travel Cloudless 
blue skies from weeks end to weeks end with now and then 
an occasional shower of rain to relieve any possible monotony 
cool breezes from the southwest the fresh salt smell of the 
sea and an equable temperature day and night may be 
trusted soon to bring back health and strength to these in 
valids who having been shedding their blood in their 
countrys cause are now justly entitled to every care and 
comfort that a grateful country can provide

FROM A CORRESPONDENT 
TYPHOID FEVER AND DIARRHG1A 
THERE has been no severe fighting since my last communica 
tion to you InI that letter I stated that the troops were in 
excellent health I regret to be unable to send such a good 
report this mail Typhoid fever has broken out and many 
men have already died of the disease In addition the troops 
are much troubled with a very severe form of diarrhcea The 
illness begins very suddenly the stools are quite liquid and 
of a light green colour tlle liquid is very acid and very frothy 
showing rapid fermentation At the commencement as well 
as at the close of the disease a little blood and much mucus 
are often passed The pAtient complains of severe scalding 
about the anus for tenl minutes after defrecation The 
malady seldom lasts more than a week but leaves the patient 
very weak The temperature is seldom or never raised I

have found the best treatment to be rigid milk diet and a 
daily injection into the rectum of cold boiled water in which 
have been dissolved a tabloid of ipecacuanha and io minims 
of chlorodyne I can speak well of the above treatment 
which I have practised on myself having had the malady 
twice and been invalided with it once 
The cause of the diarrhoea I believe to be a subacute enteritis 
following the ingestion of particles of sand Seldom a day 
passes without the camp being attacked by a  devil This 
is the popular name for a dustspout or sand storm These 
storms may last from a quarter of an hour to a whole day and 
make life a perfect misery The quantity of silica one is 
compelled to breathe and to swallow is enormous and it is to 
the irritation of the bowel membranes by these particles of 
silica that I attribute a large percentage of our cases of 
diarrhoea 
Modder River January 2th 
THE PORTLAND HOSPITAL 
Mr Anthony A Bowlby has senttothe St Bartholomew8 
Hospital Journal a letter dated January gth describing the 
establishment of the Portland Hospital at Rondebosch about 
six miles from Capetown The staff arrived at Capetown on 
December 29th I899 the whole of the equipment and stores 
did not reach Rondebosch until January 3rd but five days 
later the tents were pitched including one tent for opera 
tions one for a dispensary and one for an office The site 
chosen for the hospital is a sandy soil on an open piece of 
ground and is described as  perfect both from a scenic and a 
sanitary point of view 
The first case3 were admitted on January 8th They com 
prised 3 officers and 30 men mostly from the cavalry and 
artillery of General Frenchs column at Colesberg In most 
cases the wounds had been received on January 4th but in 
some on January ist and 2nd All had been dressed with the 
field dressing or at the field hospitals or in the train by which 
they were brought down Mr Bowlby states that  most of 
the wounds were quite aseptic though the skin was often as 
dirty as dust powder and sweat could make it and in spite 
of much oozing in many cases 
In concluding his letter Mr Bawlbyl writes I should 
like to say that the general arrangements for the dressing of 
wounded men on the field of battle and for their transference 
by train are probably better than anything ever before 
achieved by any nation and reflect the greatest possible 
redit on the RAMC who have saved our soldiers untold 
sufferings and many lives 
The Honorary Secretary of the hospital has this week re 
ceived a telegram stating that  the hospital is now full of 
patients and in thorough working order lLdoing excellent 
work 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
XII 
CAMP SAANITATION 
FROM the Modder River during the past week information 
with reference to the sanitarygcondition and the health of both 
camps has reached us Thus Reuters telegram of Sunday 
January 28th states that  our medical officers here believe 
from various indications that the Boers are suffering from 
enteric and dysentery owing to the insanitary condition of 
their trenches which are reported to be reeking with disease 
In addition to this the general demoralisation caused by the 
heavy shelling which is sufficiently erratic to keep the 
enemy always on the qui vive together with the scarcity of 
food and the difficulties of transport make the existence of 
the Boers at Magersfontein one of abject misery It will be 
interesting to know what the indications referred to may be 
but we have little doubt that diseases which are causing such 
havoc among our troops at Ladysmith are thinning the ranks 
at Magersfontein Magersfontein is well known to me and 
knowing both this position and our own position on the 
Modder I have no hesitation in saying that that held by our 
troops is much healthier and in every way more desirable 
for a camp than that occupied by the Boers The water suply 
at Magersrontein is limited and no doubt has to be carri d 
for considerable distances to various portions of the Boer 
lines The Boers as a rule are very slovenly in their camp 
arrangements and when they come to be massed in large 
numbers I have little doubt that their sanitation is extremely 
deficient From our own camp on the Modder we learn that 
instructions have been issued that in future wells must be 
sunk to supply water for drinking purposes while the river 
water is to be used only for washing and watering the horses 
mules and oxen This is doubtless an admirable precaution 
and one most likely to be effectual in checking the typhoid 
fever which already threatens that camp The water of the 
river which is practically stationary being held in large 
dams or reaches is almost bound to be polluted from the 
camp on its bank 
LOSSES IN GENERAL BULLERS SECOND ATTACK 
The total losses from General Bullers second attack on the 
position held by the Boers north of the Tugela have been com 
piled from various sources by the Daily Mail and are given as

This gives a total of 25I actually killed and I176 wounded 
of those returned as wounded we may take it that about 
8 per cent will die and the rest recover Judging from 
previous experiences of wounds from the Mauser bullet two 
thirds of the men will be able to rejoin the forces within three 
weeks and for the remaining third the period of healing is not 
likely to be a very prolonged one The proportion of killed to 
wounded is again shown in these engagements to be apparently 
very small many of our men having been sniped by the Boers 
at long ranges The Boers hid themselves in all s rts of posi 
tions among the rocks on the Tugela heights The ultimate re 
sult then of this attack will probably be the loss of between 300 
and 400 lives Considering the duration of the fighting the 
number of men engaged and the fierceness of the contest we 
must admit that these losses cannot be regarded as unduly 
large 
GENERAL BOTHA AND OUR AMBULANCE 
After the battle of Spion Kop the Maritzburg correspondent 
of the Daily Mail tells us that one of our officers who asked 
permission to remove the wounded and bury the dead was 
directed to General Botha the Boer commander who refused 
to give permission He said that previous to the war it had

barians whereas the reverse had been the case He mentioned 
instances of the Red Cross filaghaving been disrespected in 
Dape Colony by the British and added that now he had 
bhe opportunity he would insist upon some guarantee being 
liven that these acts should be discontinued before he sur 
endered the wounded Our officer expressed ignorance 
f the instances mentioned and pointed out that some of

statement that the bearers had no right on the battlefield 
until after the cessation of hostilities is not borne out by any 
clause in the Geneva Convention and it is obviously a flag 
rant violation of all the dictates of humanity and the require 
ments of ambulance work The Geneva Convention is short 
and simple it contains only nine articles and the whole 
spirit of the instrument is to faciiitate aid to the suffering in 
every possible way Article 2 is the one most directly bearing 
on the question and reads as followg 
Persons employed in hospitals and ambulances comprising the staff 
for superintendence medical service administration transport of 
wounded as well as chaplains shall narticipate in the benefit of neu 
trality whilst so employed and so long as there remain any wounded to 
bring in or to succour 
The original Geneva Convention to which all the civilised 
Powers of Europe are signatories came into force in i864 a sup 
plementary one was signed in i868 The latter part of the 
first article in this reads as follows 
When theythat is the persons referred to in Article 2 of the I864 
Convention already quoted request to withdraw the commander of 
the occupying troops shall fix the time of departure wlhichl lhe shall only 
be allowed to delay for a short time in case of military necessity 
The restrictions which any combatant officer may put upon 
the ambulance staff are thus clearly and sharply limited and 
I think there is no question that General Botha exceeded the 
rights of a civilised combatant when he said that bearers had 
no right on the battlefield until two hours after the cessa 
tion of hostilities There is certainly no mention either in 
the convention or the supplementary convention of such a 
restriction as he referred to With regard to the alleged 
charges of disrespect to the Red Cross flag by the British in 
Cape Colony we must await further information but it may 
be borne in mind that cases have been reported in connection 
with the hostilities on the western border of the Free State 
where the Boers are said to have fired upon our troops from 
waggons carrying the Red Cross Such attacks may have 
drawn forth retaliation in kind though it is to be hoped 
they have not The final attempt of the Boer leader as 
reported by the Daily Telegraph correspondent to make the 
ambulance party on Spion Kop prisoners until we returned 
25 Boers who were taken as prisoners of war by our cavalry 
is pretty conclusive evidence that good faith was not the 
guiding principle of General Bothas interference with our 
succour to the wounded 
KHAKI SUITS 
The Pall Mall Gazette of February ist has a statement that 
khaki suits have been found not of sufficient protection for 
men when sleeping on the fleld and the Government have 
placed extensive orders with Glasgow manufacturers for 
woollen khaki uniforms It may be observed that the word 
 khaki  signifies a colour that of mud and not a material In 
one of my previous letters I took occasion to point out that 
cotton khaki although excellent material in a blazing sun 
was very poor protection in caild weather and more particu 
larly when wet I wore khaki for many years off and on in 
South Africa but latterly never used it without having it 
lined with flannel and never used it at all in wet weather 
The soldier to my mind should always be provided with 
woollen or serge suits in addition to his cotton khaki In se 
lecting equipment for a corps recently formed for South Africa 
a committee of which I was a member provided all tunics 
of khakicoloured serge If men have their shirts made of 
khakicoloured flannel they can in hot weather march or patrol 
in their shirtsleevesan excellent fighting costume 
CAPE METEOROLOGICAL RETURNS 
I have been favoured by SurgeonMajor Black with some 
notes on the weather of 1898 as observed by the Meteorologist 
of Cape Colony From this it appears that the mean tempera 
ture in the shade at all the meteorological stations was 69 80 
with the comparatively small mean range of I910 As 
showing the great variations of temperature in the summer 
months it may be noted that in January 1898 the maximum 
temperature at Graaf Reinet was i080 the minimum for the 
same month was 400 At Kenilworth which is the De Beers 
village outside Kimberley and the site of Mr Rhodess 
famous siege avenue recently laid out the maximum black 
bulb in the sun was 15980 the highest shade temperature 
beiing 9470 the minimum black bulb on the grass was 39 10 
the lowest shade temperature being 440 Here again the 
great difference between the noontide temperature and the 
temperature at night is very marked Similar observations 
are recorded for February 
A POSTHUMOUS LETTER 
G W Steevenss letter to the Daily Mail of February 3rd 
has a pathetic interest for readers today Apart from its 
military and deep human interest it throws a lurid light on 
the conditions which doubtless played a great part in the pro 
duction of dysentery and typhoid among the garrison If the 
siege seemed a long one in November how much longer is it 
today Yet even then men had to dwell where no people 
should bein the clefts at the river bank  in overgrown 
ditches all were alive with men and beasts  The place 
that a month ago was only fit to pitch empty meat tins into is 
now priceless stable room  The most worthless rock heap 
below a perpendicular slope is now the choicest of town lots 
What chance had sanitation here

No 5 General Hospital January xzth I900 
I arrived on board the British India steamship in Table Bay on the 
evening of January 7th I ileed say little about the voyage The news we 
received at St Vincenit the capital of the Cape Verde islands was that 
Bullers reverse amounted to IIOO casualties and that Roberts and 
Kitchener were to sail immediately for the Cape The other civilian sur 
geon on board and myself had little to do a great mayny men however 
suffered from a low epidemic form of influenza characterised by pains in 
the back and head general prostration and coryza At least 5o per cent 
of the troops including the officers and surgeons were victims The 
troopers had an opportunity of being inoculated against enteric fever 
Some twelve or so out of over 1400 men only vere done Apart from 
slight malaisf for twentyfour hours local tenderness swollen arild painful 
inguinal and axillary glands inoculation into the flank and a rise of tem 
perature from 3IooO to 1020 F on the evening after the operation nothing 
noticeable occurred Lord Roberts and Kitchener arrived yesterday I 
met them driving about town today The destination of No 5 General 
Hospital to which I am attached is at present uniknown and meanwhile 
those members belonging to it who are in the Cape are temporarily attached 
1 o No 2 Hospital at Wynberg Both No i and No 2 Hospitals are stationed 
among the pine trees at Wynberg the wards of the former being the old 
tini wards lined by wood of the Wynberg Permanient Hospital while the 
wards of the latter are simply marquee tents 
The medical officers of No I live in small tin shanties while those of 
No 2 are under canvas Hence the present moment I am in the interim 
attached to No 2 finds iiie sitting in my solitary bell tent writing on a 
collapsible table A tent to ones self imiakes quite a pleasant and cheery 
chamber well furnished too with chair table and bed for camp life 
Wynberg is thickly wooded with high pine trees Pioius sylvestris which 
flourish luxuriantly and the wards composed of marquees and tin sheds 
are scattered about between the trees The arrangenient of the hospital 
is hence an ideal one any proximity of the wards being avoidel The 
atmosphere at AWynberg situated high up on the side of the mountains is 
delightfully fresh and exhilarating as evinced by the rapid improvement 
of the patients The administration is good The patients both Tommies 
and officers are well cared for and fed on the fat of the land 
Sir yVilliam MacCormac and Mr Makins are at present ouit here Mr 
Treves assisted at the operation at Wynberg when Mr Knight the war 
correspondent had his right arm amputated at the shoulder joint 
Today I was taken on to the staff for temporary duty only of No 2 
Hospital two marquee wards have been allotted to me on the medical 
side I was told today that I would have to be attached to No I Hospital 
in the place of one who is taking a trip home in the Majeftic  he may be 
away for two months This is rather annoving as I was hoping to go 
further inland when the remainler of No 5 hlospital had arrived 
I have only seen a few of the old casesthe results of Magersiontein 
so can say little about the injuries inflicted by the Mauser buillet Those 
cases however which I have seen show very small entrance and exit 
wounds the former often only the size of a threepenny bit or smaller 
and the latter a little larger The injury to bone is at times considerable 
for by the time the bullet has penetrated some distance into such a hard 
structure the metal expands and so the posterior portion of the bone is 
considerably shattered and splintered while usually the entrance wound 
into the bone is round and cleanlycut The long Mauser buillet unless 
it impinge mathematically perpendicular to the surface of the bone 
struck is very apt to beconle deflected and so skid off the surface of the 
bone Examples are found in the cases out here thus in several cases 
where the bullet has impinged on a rib it has failed to perforate the 
bone but has instead slid over it and reappeared even at the other side 
of the body Again in several instances the bullet has struck the smooth 
skull and travelled over its surface for some distance and then made its 
exit Injury to the brain from concussion and fracture of the inner 
table from the great force of impact are not uncommon complications of 
such head injuries 
Work is quiet in hospital at present as there are no big engagements 
at the front Roberts will possibly make matters soimiewhat more lively

THE REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF 
HEALTH FOR LONDON FOR 1898

OVERCROWDING 
By representing overcrowding as the proportion of the 
population of each district occupying tenements of one two 
three and four rooms in which there were more than two 
ersons to a room according to the census of i8g9 Mr Shirley 
Murphy shows graphically how the phthisis mortality at each 
age increases with overcrowding The figures however do 
not suffice to show whether the overcrowding caused phthisis 
or whether the disease by adding to family expenditure or by 
diminishing the wageearning power left less money available 
for rent and thus led to the overcrowding or whether again 
overcrowding may not be associated with some other condi 
tion or conditions which are favourable to disease In order 
to determine whether overcrowding bears a similar relation 
ship to the mortality from diseases other than phthisis and 
if so whether the increase of mortality from these diseases in 
association with overcrowding especially manifests itself at 
the same ages as in phthisis a comparison is made between 
phthisis and tabes mesenterica tuberculous meningitis 
diarrhoea the principal zymotic diseases excluding diarrhoea 
and cancer Mr Shirley Murphy shows that the mortality 
from tuberculous meningitis does not correspond to the extent 
of overcrowding so closely as phthisis and that from tabes 
mesenterica still less so the relation of overcrowding to 
mortality from diarrhoea and the principal zymotic diseases is 
not particularly apparent while the mortality from cancer 
does not appear to have any relation whatever to over 
crowding 
THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOuS DISEASES BY SCHOOLS 
The suffieiency of the various measures which can be taken 
for the limitation of the spread of infectious diseases at 
schools are critically reviewed and Mr Shirley Murphy 
advocates a step the value of which many of those connected 
with the public health service have recognised for some years 
Like many others he is satisfied that inasmnch as attend 
ance at school is a considerable cause of spread of infectious 
disease the examination of school children should be under 
taken in any school attendance at which is suspected to be 
caltsing prevalence of disease This examination becomes 
necessary at school because it is not practicable to examine 
numerous schorl children quickly in their own homes It is 
contended that the medical officer of health or some medical 
man acting on his behalf should make these examinations 
since the health officer is more acquainted with the behaviour 
of infectious disease in the neighbourhood of the sbchool and 
the knowledge of the condition of children in the school would 
be of material value to him in determining what action is 
required by his authority to limit the extension of the 
disease Mr Murphy observes that  London school children 
have not yet had extended to them this protection which they 
so urgently need 
BACTERIOLOGY AS AN AID TO DIAGNOSIS 
The employment of bacteriological methods for the diagnosis 
of obscure cases of diphtheria and typhoid fever is shown by 
the report to be on the increase nearly onehalf of the sani 
tary areas in the metropolisafforded facilities for such diagnosis 
in I898 and no doubt the provision is already much more 
general At Westminster an incubator steriliser and micro 
scope are provided for the use of those practitioners who have 
the leisure or the special knowledge and training to make a 
satisfactory examination for themselves 
SMOKE NUISANCES 
Among a mass of information upon various nuisances the 
subject of smoke nuisances may be selected for brief reference 
for all will be anxious to learr whether local authorities are 
maintaining the serious attempt to deal with the offence 
which the past two years have given some promise of It ap 
pears that considerable smoke nuisance arose in London during 
i888 and the circumstance is attributed to the use of inferior 
coal which resulted from the failure of the supply of Welsh 
coal The steamboats on the river seriously contributed to 
the nuisance and the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of 
London states that 265 notices were served and in two in 
stances the defendants were prosecuted and fined The Chief 
Officer of the Public Control Department of the Council reports 
that in the twelve months beginning April ist 1898 no fewer 
than 1338 cases of smoke nuisance were brought to the notice 
of sanitary authorities 
HOuSE REFUSE 
The results of the Councils efforts to secure a weekly collec 
tion of house refuse throughout London by means of the dust 
cart calling at each house has been attended with considerable 
success By degrees the old fixed dustbins of an unlimited 
size are being replaced by movable receptacles and a frequent 
and complete removal i8 thereby much facilitated The need 
for better vehicles as dustcarts and for the exercise of greater 
care in the removal of house refuse is appreciated by the 
Council who offered a prize of 25 for the best designed dust 
cart which would enable house refuse to be removed without 
nuisance The result of the competition brought out several 
suggestions for improvement The ultimate disposal of this 
house refuse is becoming a serious question with most London 
sanitary authorities the days of  shoots  are numbered as 
the available sites for many miles round the metropolis are 
becoming fewer each year and the necessity of the adoption of 
the method of destruction by fire is gradually being recog 
nised 
HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES 
During I898 the work of carrying out various schemes for 
the improvement of unhealthy areas was proceeded with and 
several schemes were undertaken by the Council under Part I 
of the Act The Housing of the Working Classes Committee 
also instructed the officers to repott on the desirability of the 
Council acquiring large plots of land and building cottages 
thereon in the outskirts of London The decision at the time 
was adverse to the proposal for the reaeons that such action 
was calculated to check the work of private persons who built 
for profit and the Council by undertaking the construction 
and management of such cottages would incur a far greater 
expense that the amount of provision required is so great 
that the demand could only be very partially met by such a 
measure and that the best results towards the housing of 
the working classes would be obtained by the development of 
means of communication between Central London and the 
outskirts 
DISINFECTION 
The subject of disinfection as practised in the different 
sanitary areas within the metropolis is fully set out in a re 
port by Dr Young which appears in the appendix In several 
districts the use of formic aldehyde for the disinfection of 
rooms either as a gas or a spray has superseded the use of 
sulphur dioxide in the large majority of London districts 
however sulphur is retained though chlorine is employed in 
exceptional cases The Cleansing of Persons Act had been 
put in force in a few districts and only in Marylebone where 
special provision under this Act has been made has there 
been any real demand for baths and other facilities for 
cleansing
