THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY FIELD HOSPITAL 
We have received from Mr Charles Stonham Officer Com 
manding and Chief Surgeon Imperial Yeomanry Field Hos 
pital a further letter dated Pretoria October 23rd 1900 in 
the course of which he gives the following details with regard 
to further wanderings of the hospital  
I El 
The March to Barberton 
On reaching Pretoria on August 28th we sent our ambulances 
on to the Irish Hospital established in the Palace of Justice 
and camped near the racecourse We had lost many transport 
animals and those still alive were worn out with long marches 
and scanty rations The Field Hospital and Bearer Company 
combined had to requisition for seventy fresh animals but 
were only able to draw ten sixty being the total number 
allowed for the whole brigade All units were in this respect as 
badly off 
The day after our arrival in Pretoria Major Hale and I went 
to No 3 Model School Hospital commanded by Major Ford 
RAMC to which we had lent our detachment for the time 
being and made all arrangements for the detachment ex 
changing one or two sick men and providing for the sending 
home of most of the St John Ambulance men who were time 
expired We drew a few stores and changed a couple of carts 
so that we should be ready to march at once when orders ar 
rived For these we had not long to wait as we received 
marching orders for the following day 
On August 30th we struck camp at 7 am  marched through 
Pretoria at 9 a m passing the recently established Yeomanry 
Branch Hospital in the grounds of Becketts House at Sunny 
side It looked most businesslike with everything in full 
swing orderlies and nurses coming to the railings to see us 
pass On the opposite side of the load was the Langmans 
Hospital 
On September ist we arrived at Balmoral having camped 
the night before two miles south of Bronkhurst Spruit We 
had to pass along the road where our animals had perished in 
such numbers during the storm of July 25th26th The stench 
was abominable and nauseating We passed through Middel 
burg on September 3rd and sent our sick to the hospital 
there We camped at Wonderfontein on September 4th 
Next day as we were inspanning we heard heavy gun fire to 
the northwest of us and after marching about three miles our 
artillery and mounted troops with two ambulances under 
Major Hale were ordered back The Boers under Com 
mandant Trichardt had attacked a party of Canadians guard 
ing the railway but had been beaten off Our ambulances 
took five wounded men from the Canadian camp to Wonderfon 
tein railway station to await a train for Middelburg 
On September 6th we joined General Frenchs division at 
Carolina and rested hre till September 9th when the 
division marched ioto the hills in the direction of Barberton 
Major Hae and Mr Green with two ambulances followed 
Mahons cavalry the rest going with the main convoy About 
1030 a m our advanced guns engaged the enemy and the 
convoy parked at the foot of a hill on which two of our guns 
were placed The guns soon drove the enemy from the oppo 
site hill  the action was most exciting especially at the 
finish when the mounted Boers broke cover and made up the 
hill we had been shelling as hard as they could go under a 
perfect hail of shell from the battery The division now ad 
vanced crossed the hill we had been shelling and camped 
about 8 oclock in the valley Our casualties in this action 
were 5 wounded  one man shot through the head died in our 
hospital on September 12th The next morning we were 
fairly in the mountains  the roads were very bad broken by 
numerous drifts over the winding Komati River On Sep 
tember 12th we camped at the foot of Roodehoogte an exceed 
ingly steep pass about half a mile long and the remainder 
of that day and the two next following were taken up in get 
ting the troops and convoy over the pass Our turn to ascend 
came on September 14th and the next day we marched to 
the top of the Devils Chute about 7500 or 8000 feet above 
sea level from which there is an extensive and beautiful 
view with Barber ton about 20 miles distant The Chute is 
a winding road about 3 miles long descending about 2500 or 
3000 feet to the lower but still hilly and broken ground 
Many waggons and animals which had come to grief in the 
descent bore witness to its difficulties Our mules were now 
thoroughly done up  we had lost so many that even after 
inspanning our horses our teams were reduced to six animals 
and we only just managed to creep into Barberton on Sep 
tember 17th when we sent our sick to the Boer hospital 
This march to Barberton will certainly rank as one of the 
great marches of the campaign  and the Boers and indeed 
the English residents there thought it impossible for us to 
enter Barberton with our heavy guns and convoy But 
French pushing on and arriving two days before he was ex 
pected caused the Boers to beat a hasty retreat leaving large 
quantities of stores and over forty engines At Barberton we 
were detained for lack of transport till October 2nd 
At Barberton 
We obtained supplies and a few fresh vegetables which were 
very welcome as we began to feel the absence of the latter 
severely indeed this is one of the chief drawbacks to long 
marches through absolutely barren country 
Unfortunately there was absolutely no forage to be ob 
tained and our transport animals had to pick op a living as 
best they could on the veld Needless to say they died daily 
A few days before we left a small quantity of forage was 
issued  had it not been for this most of the poor animals 
would have died 
From Barberton to Machadodorp 
Gn October ist we received orders to march the following 
morning as we were to proceed by the Devils Kantoor We 
were only to take such waggons as we could find full teams 
for We left 2 officers and 35 men with 7 waggons who 
camped near the station These were sent on by train and 
we found them waiting when we got to Machadodorp On 
October 2nd Major Hale Dr Green and I with 28 men 
moved off with 10 carts after passing a most disagreeable night 
in consequence of the very high wind and perpetual dust 
storms marched 18 miles and camped at the North De 
Kaap River The rest of the column going 4 miles further on 
During the night a series of heavy thunderstorms com 
menced and lasted practically without intermission for 
eighteen hours Two men in the ammunition column were 
killed by lightning and others injured Some mules were 
killed On October 3rd we commenced the ascent of the 
Kantoor by a very bad road in parts excessively steep wind 
ing up the mountain for about seven miles This day we did 
about four miles in pouring rain accompanied by heavy 
thunder and lightning The next two days were occupied in 
getting the waggons up From the top of the Kantoor a mag 
nificent view of the mountains surrounding the low ground in 
which Barberton lies was obtained On October 6th we 
reached Godwan River Station and had again to cut down our 
convoy as there was another hill to be ascended at Waterval 
Onder which according to accounts we received was worse 
than anything we had yet done We left Mr Green wilh all 
the baggage and what little stores we hadtwo carts and all 
the men but eight to go on to Machadodorp by train Major 
Hale and I with eight men and the rest of the waggons empty 
except for kits marched to Nooitgedacht through a beautiful 
valley which had it not been for the wind and heavy dust 
storms would have been most enjoyable On arriving at 
Waterval Onder about midday on October 8th we saw the hill 
of which we had received such terrible accounts and were 
agreeably surprised to find that there was really nothing for 
midable about itindeed in the afternoon we marched up it 
without difficulty with our usual ten span of mules The fol 
lowing day we reached Maohadodorp where we found the rest 
of our men and waggons who had preceded us by train 
Frenchs division and some of Bullers troops were at 
Machadodorp making a very big camp On October nth 
we received orders to cross to the north of the line at day 
break and take over the sick from the field hospital which 
was to replace us in Mahons brigade This in view of the 
fact that the yeomanry volunteers colonials and reservists 
were being sent down looked like an early return home and 
although we were sorry not to accompany General Manon as

deighted at the prospect before us We remained at Macha 
dodoip until October 2ist when we entrained for Pretoria
