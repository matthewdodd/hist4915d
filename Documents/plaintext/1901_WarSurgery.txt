In order to secure that your ship shall be healthy she 
must  
1 Have certainly not less than 120 cubic feet of space for 
each man and more in the tropics 
2 Have uptake ventilators from every compartment 
opening as near the top as 
possible 
These should be so con 
structed as to be capable of being cleaned by a brush pulled 
through 
3 Cowls and airshafts are needed to be supplemented in 
all favourable weather by rwindsail for each hatchway and 
wind scoops for each port or scuttle in the side Artificial 
ventilation is required for every space in which men live 
only to be used on the main deck in bad weather 
4 She should be warmed and kept dry by steam radiators 
In 1888 the Alexandra having been fitted with electric light 
and being now 
kept 
drier by the heat radiated from the boiler 
always alight had less than half as many cases of Malta fever 
as she had had in each of the four preceding years 
5 Whenever decks are washed the last washing over should 
be done with a 1 in 1000 solution of perchloride of mercury or 
other antiseptic The mess tables and stools are similarly 
washed This reduces the liability of casual wounds to 
inflame I would like also to spray the beams overhead with 
formalin solution once a week in order to diminish the occur 
rence of sore throats and other septic diseases But I quite 
believe the best general antiseptic on board a ship to be fresh 
dry air in plenty 
6 There should be a drying room for the wet clothes and 
bedding of the ships company 
Fleet Surgeon Kirker said that owing to the conditions 
which existed on board menofwar it was impossible to give 
men the desirable amount of air space or air supply It was 
therefore necessary that most careful attention should be 
paid to sanitary matters on board for a small amount of pre 
ventive work was worth to the service more than much 
curative It was found in the days of wooden ships that those 
with small complements were more healthy than those with 
large and it would probably always be so There were 
several sanitary improvements which one would like to see in 
the navy and the most liberal supply of fresh air possible was 
the most important of them 
Donation to the Royal Free HospitalThe Committee of 
Management of this hospital has received a donation of 
loo from Mr Peregrine Purvis 
Wallingford Cottage HospitalA sum of 1010 has 
been subscribed for the purpose of endowing a bed as a 
memorial in the Wallingford Cottage Hospital to the late Mrs 
Helen Mary Wells who took an untiring interest in the above

SOME REMARKS BY WAY OF CONTRAST ON WAR 
SURGERY OLD AND NEW 
By Sir William MacCormac Bart KCB KCVO 
MA MCh LLD DSc 
On October ist 1856 Mr MWhinnie assistant surgeon to 
St Bartholomews Hospital delivered the introductory address 
at that Institution In the course of it he referred to the 
Crimean War and many of his remarks are applicable now 
He said that 
 
although the military surgeon enjoys certain 
advantages which the events of the late war promise to render 
greater we must not conceal the fact that military surgeons 
have not yet attained the position to which their varied 
acquirements skill and devotion fairly entitles them 
Speaking of the return of the victorious regiments and the 
enthusiasm which accompanied their triumphal entry he 
called to mind the glorious part our own professional brethren 
had taken in the struggle and that the surgeons had as in 
preceding wars distinguished themselves oy their skill 
devotion bravery and humanity He quoted Colonel Ambert 
a French colonel of dragoons who had used in October 1854 
generous and eloquent words in describing the qualities of 
the medical officer 
 
In the hour after the battle he will be 
chief among the multitude during the fight calm when all 
around is agitated and disturbed in an atmosphere of grape 
shot and smoke he must deny himself all emotion The 
shrieks of the wounded the booming of cannon and the crash 
of shells do not disturb himall ranks appeal to him for help 
and he gives it alike to the poor soldier or to the mighty 
general to the fallen amongst the enemy and the wounded 
of his own army  
After the battle the General and his soldiers hear the 
shouts of triumph but the surgeon has to listen to the groans 
of the sufferer  night comes on and all are asleep save him 
awake amongst the wounded and next day exhausted with 
fatigue he sets out again with his ambulance giving hope to 
all improvising a thousand methods and supplying material 
means of aid by the power of his intelligence and skill 
Honour then to him  his mission is a thousand times 
sacred 
Fellow citizens you who were so moved at the heart 
rending sufferings of your soldiers in the East the military 
surgeon has saved your sons though he may himself have 
died at his post and the heroism of science has equalled if it 
has not surpassed the bravery of the field of battle 
Mr MWhinnie pointed out that from evidence given 
before Parliamentary committees and other undeniable 
testimony it was clearly shown that the blame attached to 
the medical department at the beginning of the Crimean 
campaign was undeserved and had the hygienic measures 
suggested by its members been carried out the losses and 
sufferings of the army would not have been greater than those 
which attend the ordinary casualties of war and that when 
the injunctions of our military brethren were attended to the 
health of our troops soon became most satisfactory 
Dr Balfourthen of the Royal Military Asylum Chelsea 
whose authority is entitled to the greatest attention and 
respectwrites that so far as I can learn from competent 
judges there has been an amount of good surgery which sur 
passed the anticipations of even the best friends of the depart 
ment and I believe we are far ahead of the French army in 
that respect 
The wars which compare with that in South Africa in 
regard to length of the struggle numbers of wounded and 
strain upon the Army Medical Department are the Peninsular 
and Crimean wars the American war of the Rebellion and 
the FrancoGerman war 
Many lesser campaigns have intervened such as the 
Egyptian and the Indian wars and the struggle between 
China and Japan but these are not epochmaking like the 
other great wars and do not constitute milestones along the 
march of military medical progress In considering this 
question we must also remember there is much concerned 
beside the mere treatment of wounds There is the organisa 
tion of the Medical Corps the improvement in the means of 
transport of sick and wounded the formation of hospitals 
and the commissariat supply 
We scarcely remember it now but chloroform was first

tested on a large scale in the field during the Crimean cam 
paign and its success was complete Mcleod says there 
was but one death which can fairly be said to have arisen 
from it Baudens tells us that chloroform was administered 
some 25000 times in the French army and that no fatal case 
had occurred 
It was found even more precious in the field than in civil 
practice by relieving shock and permitting many primary 
amputations 
which could not otherwise be performed Fewer 
assistants are required when it is employed which materially 
adds to its value Mr Blenkins of the Guards remarks that 
without the aid of chloroform many severe operations could 
not have been undertaken or performed at all 
The next great war was that of the American Rebellion 
and the records of its results are to be found in the 
monumental volumes issued from the SurgeonGenerals 
office 
In the AustroGerman war of 1866 antiseptic surgery had 
not been introduced nor was it employed during the Franco 
German war of 187071 except to a quite limited extent upon 
the German side 
The mortality after operation was then very great indeed 
on both sides and especially in the French army All kinds 
of infective diseases prevailedsepticaemia pyaemia and 
tetanus were common most indeed of the operation cases 
died pyaemic suppuration was universal gangrene and 
secondary haemorrhage were frequent Wounds of large 
joints entailed fatal results abdominal wounds were scarcely 
ever recovered from and onehalf or more of the cases of 
chest injuries died Fractures of long bones were always 
very serious especially those of femur  amputations were 
frequent and attended by a large mortality  while excisions 
of joints in the lower limb at all events were most unsatis 
factory if performed as primary operations A very large 
proportion of those who died on the field of battle if not 
killed immediately perished from haemorrhage Operations 
however were almost invariably performed with the assist 
ance of chloroform and an infinite amount of suffering was 
thus saved 
The large bullets of former campaigns weighing often twice 
as much as those now in use inflicted most extensive damage 
both on the soft parts 
and the bones the comparative mag 
nitude of the injury and the imperfect means of guarding 
against sepsis offer a sufficient explanation of the high rate 
of mortality 
In the war between Russia and Turkey a systematic at 
tempt was first made by Professors Bergmann and Reyher to 
treat gunshot wounds of the knee antiseptically with very 
great and at the time astonishing success In the campaign 
in Egypt in 1882 antiseptic methods were so effectively car 
ried out that there was not throughout a single case of ery 
sipelas pyaemia or septicaemia or of any infective preventable 
disease 
I do not mean in this brief communication to enter into 
minute details or to give you many statisticsindeed from 
South Africa there are as yet no complete ones available I 
would only seek to indicate in a general way some of the 
improved conditions of modern warfare as exemplified in 
South Africa 
The use of chloroform was universal and that not less 
blessed agent in relieving pain morphine in this way the 
detrimental influence of shock was much lessened But 
hock is less severe in the case of the modern bullet than 
previously was the case due no doubt to the different cha 
racter of the wound 
The limited amount of local damage produced in most in 
stances by the comparatively small and very swift LeeMetford 
or Mauser bullet has impressed all observers The normal 
external wound is circular and quite small like the end of 
an ordinary pencil and it soon became sealed with a black 
cab of dried blood The exit wound is often quite similar 
or like a small slit and closes in the same way The soft 
parts and bone are damaged as a rule in a limited degree 
and recovery generally took place rapidly and without com 
plication 
The bullet seems to be itself aseptic  clothing is very 
seldom carried in with it  the bullet track behaves more like 
an incised wound than a contused one  the rapid manner in 
which the small external wounds seal up reduces the injury 
to the subcutaneous form and the frequency of recovery is 
proportionately great 
The manner in which the bullet may traverse the abdomen 
thorax cranium the great joints and important viscera not 
only without entailing a fatal result but often producing only 
a minimum of constitutional or other disturbance must be 
witnessed to be realised 
I was much impressed with the small number of cases of 
primary fatal haemorrhage and the large number of traumatic 
aneurysms The large vessels even including the innomi 
nate artery may be wounded by a bullet without causing fatal 
bleeding and often with a surprisingly small amount of 
haemorrhage either external or internala totally new expe 
rience 
In the Crimea and in the FrancoGerman war the estimated 
proportion of deaths from primary haemorrhage on the field of 
battle was about 20 per cent and it was thought beforehand that 
the small hardened bullet would probably greatly increase the 
number but this is not true and in South Africa and in the 
Cuban war death from this cause was found to be compara 
tive rare The same comparative infrequency may be stated 
in respect of secondary haemorrhage 
Wounds of the blood vessels are generally followed by 
aneurysmal swellings sometimes arterial more frequently 
arteriovenous The treatment of these cases is difficult and 
many I am convinced should if possible be left alone Unless 
immediate interference is indicated by some urgency such as 
fresh haemorrhage pressure symptoms or impending gan 
grene the longer the interval permitted before operation the 
better the prospect of ultimate success besides some cases get 
well spontaneously In those operated upon the ligation of 
the vessels at the seat of injury remains for most cases the 
classic and safest treatment but it is often attended by the 
greatest difficulties and often followed by gangrene 
The treatment of the larger proportion of Mauser wounds is 
generally of the expectant kind and of none may this be more 
correctly stated than of wounds involving the abdominal 
cavity 
Many surgeons went to South Africa anticipating a large 
field of surgical enterprise in this direction but I feel sure 
the surgical records of the campaign when published will 
prove the advantages of noninterference in the greater num 
ber of instances and this has also been the experience of the 
American surgeons in the war with Spain where the weapons 
used were precisely similar There all the abdominal cases 
but one operated on died while many treated expectantly 
recovered but the general mortality was as high as 70 per 
cent of the total while in the Civil War the mortality reached 
87 per cent The liver kidneys and spleen may be perforated 
and yet recovery ensue The large intestine and I believe 
the small intestine also must have been frequently perforated 
without fatal consequences The small perforation caused by 
the Mauser bullet and the frequently empty condition of the 
bowel are the principal factors to account for a nonfatal 
issue 
In every region of the body the percentage of cases 
terminating fatally is diminished Formerly a gunshot frac 
ture of the femur formed a serious menace to life and deter 
mined not infrequently an immediate amputation In the 
Civil War of 6576 fractures of the femur nearly 3000 2923 
were treated by primary amputation and the mortality 
following the injury amounted to 50 per cent 
In the SpanishAmerican war of 82 cases of gunshot of 
femur 6 only were amputated while 74 were treated conserva 
tively We do not yet know the mortality results in South 
Africa nor do I know of any uncomplicated case of gunshot 
fracture of the femur treated by primary amputation I 
fancy there must have been very few Recovery was looked 
I upon as the ordinary result although union was often con 
siderably delayed and the risk to life and limb was increased 
the higher up the fracture  while possibly 15 to 20 per cent 
were amputated for various causes later on I think the 
record of this war will show amazingly few primary ampu 
tations for injury but a certain number had to be performed 
at a later period on account of septic conditions 
j 
The way in which many perforating wounds of one side or 
both sides of the chest recovered was nothing short of mar 
vellous Very often the most trivial inconvenience was the 
I resulttrifling dyspnoea perhaps or haemoptysis which was

often absent and frequently insignificant and complete 
recovery followed in a few days In other cases there was 
more or less haemothorax and in a few pyothorax  what the 
ultimate mortality table may show we do not yet know but it 
will not be very large In the FrancoGerman war half the 
cases terminated fatally and in the Civil War the mortality 
was as high as 626 per cent 
It may be taken as proved that a Mauser or Metford bullet 
may traverse the knee and other articulations and fracture 
the bones entering into the joint without causing any risk to 
life or limb or even any permanent disablement The old 
difficulty as to amputation or resection did not arise the 
treatment was expectant suppuration was rare and when 
passive movement was commenced sufficiently early excellent 
functional results followed 
In the sketch to which I have limited myself I think 
enough has been said to show how completely the character 
of gunshot injuries is changed Their severity is not only 
diminished but also their relative frequency so that the pro 
gressive improvement in lethal weapons does not appear to 
render the prosecution of war more difficult or to render it 
impossible as some have recently contended 
In the American Civil War 1 man was killed for every 44 
wounded while with the Mauser bullet the proportion of 
killed to wounded is 1 to 7 j Only 6 to 8 per cent of those 
wounded now die whereas In the Civil War the percentage 
was 14J this is due no doubt to the altered character of the 
injuryand also in no small measure to improvements in the 
method of treatment 
It has often been forgotten what a complete change there is 
in the battles of this present war from any that have gone 
before Stress is placed upon our losses but they are almost 
insignificant in comparison with those of former times In 
the Crimea they reached nearly half our strength There 
was no trained transport corps nor hospital service nor 
adequate system for the care of the wounded on the battle 
field at the beginning of the war and numbers died on board 
the ships transporting the sick and wounded to Scutari in 
consequence of the inadequate preparation although it is a 
journey of only 36 hours 
Now the enemy is for the most part unseen and the smoke 
less powder fails to give any sign of his whereabouts At 
some of the earlier battlesthat of Colenso for instancethe 
Boers were invisible during the entire day  not a single Boer 
was seen by our men and the result was that the enemy 
only lost 5 killed and 25 wounded  while on our side there 
were 1100 casualties 
What a contrast is this to the early battles of the Franco 
German war with their brilliant cavalry charges and their 
masses of men hurled at the objective without heed of the 
loss incurred  they were literally decimated At Gravelotte 
on August 16th 1870 each side had 16000 men placed hors de 
combat On the 18th two days later occurred the terrible 
struggle of St Privat where 120000 French were pitted against 
180000 Germans The artillery the mitrailleuses chassepots 
and needleguns plied against one another in the open Five 
times Steinmetzs sharpshooters were driven back and many 
corps lost half their officers The Prussians were repeatedly 
repulsed with fearful loss and at 7 in the evening Bazaineand 
his officers considered the field was won But at 9 the 
Prussians again attacked and in the early morning the 
Royal Guards advanced up the exposed slopes of St Privat 
against Canrobert 
They assaulted one position after another in superb fashion 
but the slaughter was dreadful  almost all the principal 
officers were struck down the colours exchanged hands 
several times and 160 German officers and 4000 soldiers were 
laid low in the attempt Nevertheless the Germans poured 
in regiment after regiment 14 Saxon batteries of artillery were 
added to the ten Prussian ones and as the sun was setting 
the Saxon regiments of the Guard drums beating and trum 
pets calling rushed at the double on Canroberts forces 
there was fighting in the streets in the houses in the ceme 
tery man to man with bayonet and butt end of musket and 
the place was taken 
The French lost that day 12000 men and the Germans more 
than 20000 amongst them the flower of the army for the 
Prussian Guard had 300 officers and 8000 soldiers either 
wounded or killed One of them was Langenbecks son who 
told me he had spent many long hours in search of him only 
to find him mortally wounded 
The Germans nearly lost the battle and would certainly 
have lost had Bazaine come to the assistance of his colleague 
He heard the guns and was informed of the situation by 
Marshal Leboeuf yet he never left his office at Plappeville 
Soon afterwards Moltkes supreme knowledge shut him up 
helpless with 170000 men in Metz and a little later on 
October 29th Metz la Pucelle and all this great French army 
was forced to surrender 
In some of the great Napoleons battles as many as 38 per 
cent were disabled  at Waterloo the number was 24 per cent 
At Koeniggratz the bloodiest battle of the war of 1866 it was 
7 per cent At Mars le Tour it was 16 per cent and at 
Sedan 12 per cent I was there that day September ist 
1870 when the French lost 3000 killed and 14000 wounded 
not very far short of our total loss for the entire period of the 
war in South Africa 
During twentyone months of this war from the beginning 
up to the end of June 4355 officers and men have been killed 
in action 18291 were wounded and 1493 or 81 per cent of 
the wounded died 
Modern troops in the field are now supplied with a packet 
of antiseptic material called a  
first field dressing It is 
hermetically sealed and carried in a special pocket in each 
soldiers jacket If a surgeon be near he applies the gauze 
contained in the packet to the wound and fastens it on with 
the bandage supplied  or the wounded man himself does it 
or his comrade for him as every man is taught its use and 
application It certainly helps somewhat and comforts the 
wounded  but I do not myself much believe in its antiseptic 
adequacy and it often slips out of place 
Later on the Roentgen rays are of great service  they 
localise the foreign body when lodged and determine the ex 
tent and direction of a fracture They should serve to abolish 
the use of the probe which is a fertile cause of mischief and 
of needless pain and suffering 
Before the regimental system ceased to be each regiment 
had a surgenmajor and two assistant surgeons In time of 
peace there was very little for them to do except to look after 
a few sick in the regimental hospital In time of war they 
accompanied their regiments into action as at Waterloo and 
in the Crimea and tended the wounded often under fire 
When the regiment moved on the wounded had perforce to 
be left behind to the chance care of such persons as could be 
found to look after them and there was practically no or 
ganised system of transport field hospitals and bearer com 
panies 
The organisation of the transport of wounded from the 
field to the field hospital and thence to the stationary and 
base hospitals is now very complete and worked well in 
South Africa Formerly the wounded might have to lie for 
days untended now they are looked after with the least pos 
sible delay and passed along the continuous relief chain from 
the front to the base with a minimum of hardship and delay 
I myself saw many who had been exposed after Sedan for 
three or four days and some were even longer without any 
succour 
The hospital ships and hospital trains are comparatively 
new departures and of immense value in modern warfare 
The ships were I consider something as near perfection as 
anything human can be and the hospital trains did splendid 
work One officer I knewMajor BrazierCreaghlived for 
twelve months in one of these trains almost constantly on 
the move During the period of twelve months and six 
weeks that Major BrazierCreagh commanded this train he 
conveyed 16485 officers and men from the battlefields and 
along the lines of communication covering a distance of 
34473 miles The train was several times under fire and was 
shelled on two occasions It was also in collision and more 
than once in imminent risk of being wrecked by the Boers  
and the Princess Christian Train made 102 journeys carried 
7000 patients and traversed over 30000 miles up to June 
last and is still at work with the same staff of surgeons and 
nurses on board as at the beginning 
At the battle of Colenso before the firing had ceased a 
hospital train was loaded with 120 wounded men every one 
of whom had been previously dressed and otherwise attended 
to by the bearer companies This train with its occupants

lying comfortably in their cots was soon speeding on its way 
to the general hospital at Maritzburg A few days later 
these and other wounded men were sent on to one of the 
hospital ships provided with every medical and surgical 
requirement and luxury awaiting their arrival at Durban 
Many thus found themselves aboard ship in a swinging cot 
in the fresh sea air a couple of days after they had been 
wounded some 150 miles inland What a contrast to the in 
cidents which took place in the Crimea and on some battle 
fields in India where the wounded had often to be left for 
days upon the field being frequently plundered and some 
times killed by murderous thieves amongst the camp fol 
lowers  
Dr Farquharson MP congratulated the Section on 
having had the opportunity of hearing from a surgeon of Sir 
William Mac Cormacs unique and varied experience there 
suits of military surgery in South Africa in comparison with 
those in 
previous campaigns His address formed a complete 
and forcible vindication of the Army Medical Department 
and their admirable work in South Africa under conditions of 
exceptional difficulty and danger and at times when the 
society globe trotters who afterwards posed as critics were 
comfortably in bed atter a good dinner This work had been 
insufficiently appreciated and the Department had felt rather 
strongly that their proceedings had been specially subjected to 
hostile criticism and that it was thought necessary to appoint a 
commission to make inquiries whilst the purely military side of 
the campaign had hitherto escaped hostile comment and in 
vestigation The Commission was composed of able and 
trustworthy men who took a calm judicial and dispassionate 
review of the situation and it was unjust cruel and 
even libellous to characterise their report as a whitewashing 
one Reading between as well as on the lines they found some 
emphatic condemnation of the insufficient appreciation by 
the Government of the difficulties of the situation but at the 
same time they praised highly the skill devotion and 
humanity shown by the army doctors under conditions of 
absolutely unprecedented difficulty Undermanned as they 
were compelled to attend vast numbers of sick and hurt 
encountering overwhelming difficulties of transport and 
hospital accommodation they still attained results unknown 
in previous warfare The climate had something to do with 
this as well as the Mauser bullet but much was due to the 
early antiseptic dressing on the field as well as to the skill 
and care with which the wounded were afterwards treated 
Fleet Surgeon G Kirker RN said he had listened with 
great pleasure to the very interesting and instructive address 
of his distinguished countryman and townsman Sir William 
MacCormac He did not propose to refer to Sir William 
MacCormacs paper further than to observe that it showed 
the great difficulties which the RAMC had to contend with 
and the splendid results which in spite of these difficulties 
they achieved With the permission of the Section he wished 
to refer to a somewhat personal matter in connection with the 
nature of modern smallbore bullet wounds a subject which 
Sir William MacCormac shortly treated Through Sir William 
MacCormacs instrumentality he had the opportunity of ob 
serving bullet wounds in the RussoTurkish war of 187778 
and he presumed to regard himself as the prophet of the 
humane character of modern bullet sounds of which they 
heard so much now In Turkey he saw compound fractures 
of the thigh which healed without suppuration perforations 
of the kneejoint which healed without trouble and cases of 
penetration of the chest from side to side which recovered 
without a bad symptom When he returned home he made 
experiments on the subject of rifle bullet wounds and based 
on these observations he brought forward the then new 
doctrine that rifle bullet wounds were less severe than round 
bullet wounds and would be the more so the more their 
peculiar charactersespecially smallness of diameter and 
hardnesswere accentuated He also pointed out that the 
splendid results especially in the treatment of penetrating 
wounds of the kneejoint in the hands of Dr Reyher which 
were attributed to antiseptic treatment were to a great extent 
probably due to their being produced by rifle bullets A 
similar remark had recently been made by surgeons who had 
been out in South Africa and several characteristics of small 
bore rifle wounds had been brought forward in connection 
with the South African war which he brought forward twenty 
years ago His papers on the subject were one in the Transac 
tions of the International Medical Congress of London 1881 
and another read at the meeting of the British Medical Asso 
ciation in Belfast in 1884 and printed in the British Medical 
Journal in the following September 
SurgeonGeneral ODwyer pointed out that with a force ex 
tended over a frontage of three miles as was the case at 
Waterloo it was much more easy to remove the wounded 
promptly than when they are scattered over an advance ex 
tending over twenty milesand Lord Roberts informed the 
troops at Bisley the other day that future wars against troops 
armed with modern rifles must be in the very extended for 
mation It would require a great increase of medical personnel 
as well as of the transport for medical purposes Surgeon 
General ODwyer fully corroborated Sir Wm MacCormacs 
experience as to the benign character of the modern small 
bore bullet He also pointed out the difficulties the medical 
service had to contend with inimprovisingjteranweand equip 
ment only intended to be sufficient for a force of 70000 men 
to suffice for a force of 200000 for it appeared from the 
evidence given by the Chief Ordnance Officer at Woolwich 
Arsenal as given before Mr Justice Romers Committee that 
after the hospital equipment for the first two army corps 
70000 men had been despatched only one general hospital 
and three stationary hospitals remained in store to meet the 
requirements of the remaining 130000 men added to the 
South African field army He concluded by thanking Sir 
Wm MacCormac for his interesting paper and from the de 
ductions from the war which would be treasured up by those 
who had to do with wounded men 
SurgeonGeneral Hamilton commented on the various 
forms of bullet that had been in use in the British army 
Commencing with the original spherical and passing on to 
the Mini the Enfield the Snider with its expanding 
indeed almost explosive bullet the Martini and finally the 
LeeEnfield of 0303 bore He alluded to the great pene 
tration of the present bullet deprecating in the strongest 
terms the use of expanding bullets and proposed a motion on 
the subject 
SurgeonMajor Poole said his experience of the South 
African war had been gathered from his connection with the 
Soldiers Help Society and pointed out that the worst cases 
of injury had been from the use of explosive bullets  the 
present bullet was comparatively harmlessmen coming to 
his study for help to work who had had a bullet entering 
one side of the head behind the ear and passing out at the 
right eye whose appearance and behaviour had been that of 
happy individuals 
SurgeonGeneral Harvey DirectorGeneral IMS thought 
that in justice to the Government of India he should 
mention that the first field dressing had been used in 
all recent Indian campaigns The surgical results of 
these campaigns had been excellent  in the second 
Mirangui expedition of 1891 less than 3 per cent of the 
wounded had died and the proportion of deaths among 
the wounded in the Tirah campaign was very small He en 
tirely agreed that in fighting with a civilised enemy the use 
of expanding bullets should be absolutely prohibited but in 
the case of savage foes who were determined to kill their enemy 
though they died for it the case was different A fanatical Ghazi 
was not checked by the modern bullet which went through him 
like a knittingneedle through a pat of butter and it seemed 
to him quite legitimate to stop him by any means necessary 
including the Dumdum bullet It was false humanity to 
allow our own men to be killed rather than take means to 
effectually prevent this by disabling the enemy 
Mr J W Smith Manchester said that from his experience 
in the South African campaign he wished to support the con 
clusion enunciated in the paper He regarded the first field 
dressing as somewhat ineffectual either as an aseptic or anti 
septic agent and attributed the aseptic course of wounds 
rather to the nature of the wound and atmospheric 
conditions than to the dressing Some better means of 
fixing the dressing should be devised 
SurgeonGeneral Harveys observations on the advantages 
of the Dumdum bullet in war with savage and fanatical foes 
were approved by the Section and SurgeonGeneral Hamiltons 
motion deprecating such bullets was not entertained
