ENTERIC FEVER IN SIERRA LEONENOT YET 
ENDEMIC 
with a note on a case of infection three months after 
contact 
tafite By Major F Smith RAMC 
Sierra Leone 
Enteric fever has not been generally regarded as a Sierra 
Leone disease and as a matter of fact it is very rare indeed 
The object of this paper is to record the fact that enteric is 
among us to moot the question as to whether it is a new 
thing or not and to point out a danger which overhangs us in 
the shape of an extension of the disease Our insanitary sur 
roundings are likely to conduce to its establishment in Free 
town The city contains some 40000 inhabitants spread over 
a large area and the place is honeycombed with unsteined 
wells and cesspits 
the latter generally at a higher level than 
the former and within twelve yards distance A great part 
of the inhabitants do not yet use any common water supply 
These conditions are more likely to bring about an endemic 
state than to give rise to a sudden extensive 
epidemic 
It seems an extraordinary thing that enteric has not been 
more common in Sierra Leone considering that there is 
nothing to prevent it from travelling from the North of 
Africa where it is common or from South Africa 
where it has played such havoc with our soldiers 
Malaria has however been hitherto regarded as almost 
our only fever and the facts seem to justify this 
view The absence of records of enteric cannot be looked 
upon as being to any great extent due to cases having 
escaped the notice of medical men We have had skilful 
physicians here since the early part of last century men with 
experience of diseases of other countries and they are not 
likely to have all of them overlooked the existence of a 
malady having such marked characteristics No doubt many 
like myself have been on the lookout for it 
The following is a list of all the causes and suspected cases 
I have heard of

Second quarter A West Indian negro woman in Freetown Two 
of 1901 attacks of haemorrhage Brought to my notice 
by Dr Latchmore 
West Indian negro soldier in Tower Hill Barracks 
Verified at necropsy 
Dec 190X A suspected case in a Freetown native 
Jan 1902 Ditto 
Feb 1902  Three native children living in one house in 
Freetown 
The diagnosis in Cases 11 and 12 is strengthened by the fact 
that the dried blood examined by Professor A E Wright in 
the laboratory of the Army Medical School at Netleygavea 
positive reaction in the agglutination test 
Eight of the 13 cases namely Nos 2 and 7 to 13 came 
under my personal observation Though there is no definite 
evidence of any connexion of these cases one with another the 
sequence of occurrence is such as to suggest relationship be 
tween Nos 2 and 3 also between No 7 and all those which 
followed except No 8 
Case No 2 was in a man who had recently arrived from 
Egypt where enteric was rife He was taken ill almost im 
mediately after arrival in this country and while on service in 
the hinterland He was brought down through Panguma 
and stayed there two days in quarters in the barrack en 
closure in which case No 3 occurred a few months later 
Case No 7 is dealt with below but of those which followed 
No 8 was in a soldier in isolated barracks on a hill and was 
most likely connected with the arrival early in 1901 of some 
comrades who came from St Helena in the same ship which 
brought the case No 7 
The remainder occurred on the same side of the town as 
No 7 but the houses were by no means near and there was no 
common water supply It is probable though that the 
clothing was washed in the same stream Dirty clothes in 
Sierra Leone are  
taken to the brook 
 
and washed in the pools 
which in the dry season are more or less stagnant but com 
municate by rivulets of running waterhot water is never 
used by our washerwomen These cases might of course 
have arisen out of Nos 2 4 5 or 6  or again out of unrecog 
nized cases from the hinterland 
Case No 7 bears on the question as to whether or no enteric 
fever is always waterborne The woman was in St Helena 
with her husband  she came to Sierra Leone in the middle of 
January on a transport which had carried soldiers and Boer 
prisoners from South Africa Towards the end of the follow 
ing April she developed enteric fever Her husband who 
came with her had not been ill neither had her only child 
or any one connected with the family The woman was in 
lodgings in the town where as before stated the disease is 
almost unknown No local source of infection could be dis 
covered 
There is little doubt that in this case the germs of infection 
came from St Helena or the transport The assumption 
then is that the infection was carried about on the person or 
belongings of the woman or some member of her family for 
some weeks before it found its way into her system 
It will be gathered from the remarks on the other cases that 
there is no certainty about the origin of this case No 7  but 
the rarity of the disease in Sierra Leone and the absence of 
evidence of other cases occurring in or near the house before 
this West Indian woman was attacked together with the im 
 portant point that she had recently come from an infected 
1 place is strongly in favour ofA the theory that she brought the 
bacillus with her 
The serious fact in any case is that we have enteric fever in 
Sierra Leone  and it is well that all should know it in good 
time Our climate is bad enough already without the addi 
I tion of typhoid to our burdens 
THE CLIMATE AND DISEASES OF BANGKOK 
By P A Nightingale MDEdin 
Harrogate late of Bangkok Siam 
The only excuse I have to offer for my paper is that hitherto 
nothing authentic has been written or published as to that 
much abused place Bangkokwhich is usually regarded by 
the inhabitants of Singapore and Hong Kong especially those 
who have never visited Siam as a certain deathtrap where 
not even the necessaries of life can be obtained and where 
Europeans might with wisdom follow the Chinese custom 
and keep their coffins handy in the storeroom or godown 
The difficulty of collecting reliable medical facts in Bangkok 
i is very considerable for though several hospitals have existed 
for years they have for the most part been in the hands of 
natives and other irregular practitioners so that any statistics 
collected by them would have to be looked upon with consider 
able suspicion 
Some five years ago a sanitary department was started 
which though working against the many difficulties insepar 
able from a treaty port and Asiatic government has been ablor 
to do a 
good 
deal of practical if not very scientific work 
A police surgeon was later appointed who some three yea
