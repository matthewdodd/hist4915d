THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
AFTER SPION KOP 
By FREDERICK TREVES FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Forces 
Spearman8 Camp on the Tugela February 7th 1900 
SHELL AND SHRAPNEL WOUNDS 
As I mentioned in my last letter the wounded from the 
battle of Spion Kop on January 24th presented a very 
large proportion of shell and shrapnel injuries In spite 
of every possible care the shell wounds almost without 
exeeption have done badly We had over 30 deaths 
within the week after the battle and these were nearly all 
cases of shell injury The wounds are of the worst type 
contused and lacerated and very often contain dirt 
fragments of stone and even grass The men at the time 
of the battle had Bad a week of hard work and hardship 
and were unnerved by the terrible experience on the 
summit of the hill A good number of primary amputa 
tions were found necessary and a still larger number of 
secondary amputations As an example of the latter I 
may mention the following case 
AMPUTATION OF THE UPPER LIMBS BY BERGERS 
METHOD 
A man was wounded in the right shoulder on January 
24th by a Mauser bullet at short range The bullet 
entered at the outer side of the limb about the centre of 
the deltoid muscle It passed through the ala of the 
scapula and was ultimately found under the skin near 
the vertebral column It was much distorted The 
tiMues at the back of the shoulder were abraded and con 
tused by a fall upon stone Dr Nuttal under whose care 
the patient was enlarged the wound and found great 
shattering of the humerus about the surgical and 
anatomical necks Permission for amputation had not 
been given by the patient and the limb was adjusted on 
splints The wound suppurated and the patient rapidly 
lost ground I was of opinion that an amputation of the 
shoulderjoint would hardly be possible owing to the 
state of the soft parts It was evident also that the head 
of the humerus was shattered The scapula was shot 
through I therefore proposed the amputation of the 
entire limbincluding the scapula and the outer two 
thirds of the clavicleby Paul Bergers method This 
operation I performed on February 3rd The joint was 
found to be full of pus and fragments of bone The 
patient has so far done very well I imagine this to be 
the first occasion upon which this operation has been done 
on the field 
COLOTOMY FOR WOUND OF RECTUM 
One case presented a curious complication A man was 
shot through both hips by a Mauser or a shrapnel probably 
the latter The lower end of the rectum was wounded in 
two places and in due course famces and flatus were passed 
through each of the gluteal wounds In one of these 
wounds the hipjoint was involved The wound in the 
rectum was easily felt on anal examination The mans 
condition was absolutely deplorable and his pain intense 
The question was should the case be left or should the 
lower end of the rectum be excised or should left colotomy 
be performed  We decided to perform colotomy and this 
was carried out by Dr Nuttal There were many difficul 
ties in the way of a direct operation upon the rectum 
WOUNDS OF THE THORAX 
Many of the wounds of the thorax have been attended by 
pneumothorax hmmothorax and empyema Taken as a 
whole this series of cases has done well 
THE TELEPHONE PROBE 
Before I left England Dr Hecleythe physician in 
charge of the electrical department at the London Hos 
pitalkindly lent me a telephone probe This instrument 
has been of the very greatest possible service and it has 
proved to be absolately reliable and very easy to manipu 
late As we have no Roentgen ray apparatus at the front 
I do not know what we should have done without this 
handy little instrument In compound fractures with 
comminution of the bone it is impossible by any ordinary 
examination to tell a distorted and brokenup Mauser from 
a fragment of bone The probe reveals the metal at once 
and will detect the smallest fragment I have a piece of a 
Mauser picked out of a compound fracture by the probe 
which has precisely the feel to the finger and common 
probe of a fragmentary bone 
The news has just reached us that a Roentgen ray appa 
ratus is on its way to this field hospital 
ABDOMINAL OPERATIONS 
But little encouragementattends upon abdominal opera 
tions 
i The first argument agaiiot laparotomy rests with the 
fact that a very large number of cases in which the patient 
has been shot directly through the abdomen have re 
covered perfectly without operation As examples of such 
recovery I may mention the following 
Point of entry near navel and point of exit by side of 
second lumtar vertebra 
Entry directly over stomachand exit by upper part of 
right loin i 
Entry in anterior part of one loin and exit in other loin 
Entry at tip of eleventh rib and escape through the 
opposite axilla 
2 The second point is this The Mauser is apt to make a 
small hole in the bowel which hole maybe closed by appo 
sition with an adjacent coil of intestine 
3 In the third place abdominal operations are not very 
easy in a place where the supply of water is very limited 
and where washingas of towels etcis difficult to pro 
vide for Major Kirkpatrick has surmounted these 
obstacles in a very able manner but still they cannot be 
quite got over 
The appliances I took with me for abdominal operations 
get over all difficulties as to really efficient and sterile 
sponges sterile silk etc and a sterile instrument tray and 
sponge dish They also provide a reliable means of 
making a carbolic solution The whole tin is so small 
that three can be carried in a capacious coat pocket They 
are however still far from perfect 
4 In the fourth place the injury in many of the cases 
is very extensive As an instance I may quote the follow 
ing example 
A man was knocked down by a Mauser in the engage 
ment of Monday February 5th I witnessed the engage 
ment and saw the rifle fire and shell fire to which the 
men were exposed He was hit at long range and fell 
about I PM He was brought into hospital on a stretcher 
having been carried by hand all the way He came in at 
530 PM having had to wait until the infantry and field 
artillery had retired I saw him at once He was 
blanched and somewhat collapsed His pulse was small 
He answered all questions promptly He had had an in 
jection of morphine when picked up and had vomited 
twice There was still much pain but the abdomen was 
quite flat There was evidence of considerable peritoneal 
haemorrhage The wound was a Mauser wound and was 
over the left tenth rib in the midaxillary line There was 
no point of exit but a wellmarked ecchymosis of the 
right parietes at the tip of the right twelfth rib suggested 
the position of the bullet The case seemed favourable 
for operation and I carried out a laparotomy by median 
incision at once The following condition was found

mous quantity of blood in the peritoneal cavity and evi 
dently from the spleen a linear rent in the upper jejunum 
4 inch long four holes entry and exit in the jejunum at 
its very commencement a hole in the lower part of the 
right lobe of the liver All the five wounds in the bowel 
were carefully sutured the smaller holes requiringin 
addition to a continuous suture of the mucous membrane 
from 3 to 6 Lembert sutures I found the bullet lying 
loose under the liver The wounds in the solid organs had 
ceased to bleed and were not touched The whole peri 
toneal cavity was flushed out with hot water which had 
been passed through a Berkefeld filter after having been 
boiled The operation of necessity occupied a considerable 
time The patient died shortly after he was removed to 
his tent 
THE OPERATING TENT 
I may say that these operations are done practically in 
the open air that is under the shelter of a widelyopened 
square tent The light therefore is good A great trouble 
is from flies they cover the surgeons hands and with all 
care cannot be kept from alighting on exposed intestine 
etc The flies in this camp are nearly as bad as they were 
at Frere where they constituted a real plague 
THE LEEMETFORD 
We have a certain number of wounded Boer prisoners 
in the hospital and it is evident from their wounds that 
the IeeMetford bullet is not so merciful as the Mauser 
GENERAL WOODGATE 
I am sorry to say that General Woodgate is not progres 
sing favourably and is indeed losing strength I had to 
remove the damaged eye The General is free from pain 
but is seldom really conscious although he recognises his 
friends and answers a few questions 
THE TELEPHONE PROBE 
The following description of the telephone probe taken 
from Dr Hedleys recent work on Therapeutic Electricity 
and Practical Muscle Testing toRether with the accompany 
Dg illustration for the use of which we are indebted to 
1W Hedley and to Messrs 3 and A Churchill the pub 
lishers of his book will explain the construction of the 
probe to which Mr Treves refers 
 It was de Wilde a civil engineer who I872 first pro 
posed the use of the electric bell as a signal of a metallic 
body in the tissues An improvement on this is the tele 
phone probe Its action depends on the difference of 
potential between two different metals and upon the 
delicacy with which the telephone will disclose an electric 
current so engendered A thin sheet of pure silver is 
placed upon an indifferent part of the body and attached 
by means of a wire having a telephone in circuit to a 
silver probe or heavilyplated exploring needle If the 
probe be inserted into the tissues the telephone is silent 
because there is no difference of potential that the tele 
phone will register but immediately a metallic body other 
than silver is touched there is a fall of potential a current 
is produced and the telephone indicates the fact Used to 
verify the localisation of foreign metallic bodies whose 
presence has been shown by radiography this probe is a 
strikingly effective device 
THE BASE HOSPITAL CAPE COLONY 
FRoM OUR SPECIAL COBESPONDENT AT CAPETOWN 
February 14th 1900 
NEw BEARER COMPANIES CAPE MEDICAL STAFF CoiPs 
IN my last weeks letter I was compelled to point a few minor 
details in which it seemed as if the extraordinary strain of 
the campaign was apparently overtaxing the per8onnel of the 
medical authorities The only wonder is that more weak 
spots have not been evident considering how fruitful this 
war has been in surprises and how utterly it has falsified all 
expectations as to its duration and magnitude When we 
reflect that Great Britain has never during the whole course 
of her national existence put into the field forces of anything 
like the magnitude of those engaged in the present campaign 
and that it has to be carriecd on in a country singularly 
deficient in natural resources and in means of communication 
it is possible to form some estimate of the difficulties which 
have met the medical authorities in common with their 
colleagues in every branch of the service It is not too much 
to say that everything in this war has to be carried on under 
what are experimental conditions If until the experiments 
had been tried the British taxpayer had been asked to equip 
and maintain an army medical establishment sufficient to 
deal with the present crisis he would have retorted that such 
a premium was an altogether fantastic measure of national 
assurance But it is satisfactory to be able to note the extent 
to which the authorities here have developed the improvising 
faculty Even the small defects which I mentioned last week 
and which I hardly thought were remediable are being so 
rapidly put straight that in a week or two they will be probably 
nonexistent It has often been said by Colonials that the 
British soldier is hidebound by tradition and will not deviate 
one inch from the beaten track This war certainly disproves 
that assertion so far as medical matters are concerned The 
capacity shown for original arranigements has been simply 
marvellous Since my last letter the startling but manifestly 
commonsense departure has been taken of determining to 
practically break up the bearer companies of the RAMLC 
substituting therefor newlyraised companies of the Cape 
Medical Staff Corps and thus setting free the highly 
trained regulars for ward work at the hospitals As 
I pointed out in a previous letter hospital orderlies 
cannot be improvised whereas bearers can The average 
citizen can be taught stretcher drill and first aid in a 
week or two and got to take to it very creditably Months 
will not make him a decent hospital orderly except he be 
under the perpetual supervision of a superior The moral of 
this has been acted upon Companies D and E of the Cape 
Medical Staff Corps are now being rapidly drilled and trained 
and will be fit for the front in another week or so I hear that 
probably another company will be raised at once and more 
will follow if required The men are sbaping better than I 
at first thought they would Major Nicol RAMC of the 
2oth Company which is now being broken up as a unit is 
supervising the training of these compinies and is I under

stand to take command of D Mr Fryer a South African 
practitioner who has been acting as one of the civil surgeons 
at the Woodstock Station Hospital is to be one of his 
subalterns SurgeonCaptain Black the Medical Superin 
tendent at Robben Island who properly commands one of the 
permanent companies C but who was not permitted by the 
Cape Government to leave his civil appointment when his 
company was mobilised has now obtained the desired leave 
and is to take command of E I have not heard of any other 
appointments having been made 
The projected equipment by the local St John Centre of a 
bearer company has for some reason or other fallen through 
This is I think a pity as it would have been a veryeffective 
way not only of showing patriotism but of rendering real ser 
vice The Centre would have been in a position to get excel 
lent men and the very fact of the company being raised and 
equipped by the Centre would doubtless have induced a class 
of recruits passed pupils to come forward who would not 
volunteer in the ordinary way So soon as these volunteer 
companies are in working order they will set free a very valu 
able accession of strength of the Royal Army Medical Corps 
available for the hospitals 
WOODSTOCK STATION HOSPITALs 
In other directions the authorities have shown their com 
mon sense in not hesitating to break up units to meet the 
special requirements of the situation and provide personnel 
where it is most needed No 5 General Hospital is I under 
stand not to be mobilised its personnel is at present scat 
tered to the ends of the South African earth Some are in Natal 
some with French some with M4thuen and some down here 
Major Gibson of that unit is temporarily attached to the 
Woodstock Station Hospital where his services are extremely 
welcome as the administrative work is becoming too much 
for Major Tuke 
This hospital is being thoroughly remodelled and is fast 
becoming quite equal to any demands laid upon it Four new 
wocden huts are about to be erected making a total of six of 
these structures which are excellently adapted for the pur 
pose and will enable the marquees to be vacated as the rainy 
season comes on Some old buildings are being thoroughly 
reconetructed and adapted for infectious and lunacy wards 
The huts are hygienically perfect and should be most com 
fortable in both summer and winter A completely new system 
of drainage for these buildings is being laid out under Colonel 
Supples supervrision And in connection with these altera 
tions a systematic classification of the patients is being made 
All the more serious medical cases cases of enteric fever in a 
ward of their own pneumonia acute rheumatism and the 
like are located in one of the wings of the permanent build 
ing and the 6lite of the nursing staff including the sisters 
whom I mentioned last week are attending to them Five 
more nurses of the Army Reserve are expected almost imme 
diately to be followed I understand by five more For the 
accommodation of these ladies a whole block of quarters 
hitherto occupied by the commanding officer and other officers 
and staff is to be set aside the former inmates being put on 
lodging allowance The civil surgeon who attends to outside 
work and who has other quarters will continue to reside onthe 
place a very excellent arrangement securing the presence of 
one medical officer in addition to whoever may be the orderly 
medical officer of the day The medical staff has been 
strengthened so that seven executive officers are availablea 
number amply sufficient for present needs especially as recruit 
exattrination is likely soon to be out of the way With these 
 new srrangements and a further strengthening of the orderly 
personnel this hospital will compare most favourably with any 
civil hospital in the Colony and will be able if required to ac 
commodate fully 5oo patients Another little point I must 
menti9n for the benefit of those who have their doubts about 
the feeding of Tommy when sick The chief cook of No 5 
General a Swiss chef of undoubted attainments and drawing 
I am told a salary of 150 per annum has been taken on at 
Woodstock 
ENTERIC FEVER 
A number of cases of enteric fever but especially of 
pneumonia and acute theumatism continue to come into this 
hospital from the transports Very good results are being 
obtained all round especially with the enteric cases very few 
of which have had any dangerous complications The 
medical officer in charge of this ward informs me that he 
relies principally upon Yeos chlorinated quinine mixture 
and seldom administers stimulants earlier than the third week 
If pneumonia occurs he promptly adds digitalis to the 
quinine He draws attention also to the factknown to all 
South African practitioners of experiencethat high tem 
peratures have by no means the same clinical significance as 
in England Patients keep a temperature of from ko40 to IO50 
night after night with a clean tongue a clear head and a 
good appetite and do splendidly after all He never uses any 
galenical antipyretics and only in rare cases resorts to 
sponging with a lump of ice in flannel South African enteric 
is a very puzzling thing Spots are quite seldom met with 
and the temperature very rarely takes the characteristic 
curves But the enlarged spleen is almost constantly 
present and often furnishes the only diagnostic sign If any 
severe diarrhoea comes on the indigenous drrtg Monsonia 
ovata or better if obtainable Monsonia Burkei brings about 
admirable resuks There are several cases of phthisis in the 
hospital mostly traceable to previous pneumonia A project 
is on foot to provide an openair treatment for them as it 
would be a pity to send them to England just now 
ENGAGEMENT OF COLONIAL NURSEs 
About forty Colonial nurses have already been engaged by 
the department to accompany invalids to England These 
ladies are paid 2 per week until return to Capetown with all 
found a very liberal remuneration considering the little 
element of pleasurethat must enter into such a trip A very 
careful selection has been made only nurses with undoubted 
qualification being engaged Several Colonial nurses have 
also been taken on for other work 
INCOME TAX 
One notable concession has just been made to the local 
civil surgeons and other local officers partVeipate in the 
benefit Hitherto income tax has been deducted from the 
pay of these gentlemen Against this one of the civil sur 
geons protested on the ground that he had no English domi 
cile and did not come under the purview of the Board of 
Inland Revenue The Field Marshal adopted this view and 
ordered the deduction to be suspended pending communica 
tion with the War Office These little concessions do much to 
create a good feeling 
SURGICAL CONVALESCENTS AT THE WYNBERG HOSPITALS 
There is little doing at the Peninsula General Hospitals 
N O I especially is practically a convalescent home A some 
what interesting case which I think I mentioned in a former 
letter is now almost well It is remarkable as showing the 
results obtained even with bullet wounds other than the 
Mauser The man was wounded at Belmont a sporting bullet 
striking just over the right eye ploughing through the frontal 
bone and emerging in the right temple Numerous frag 
ments of the frontal bone and much sloughing skin were 
found portions of the frontal lobe were removed and a good 
deal of cerebrospinal fluid escaped This escape of fluid con 
tinued for some days There were never any signs of fracture 
of the base The wound was gently irrigated with warm 
boracic lotion at first weak perchloride and finally dusting 
with iodoform being substituted later At first there was 
total blindness of the right eye but now he has recovered per 
ception of form and colour and can count fingers although he 
cannot make out details The range of vision is limited irregu 
larly An elongated detachment or rather separation of the 
retina is shown by the ophthalmoscope He was very drowsy 
at first but the temperature never rose above ioo and that 
only early in the case The intellect is now perfectly clear 
He vomited early in the case He had a few spasms in both 
lowerextremities early and the left hand and leg are still weak 
Facial movements are diminished en the left and the right 
orbicularis oculi is partially paralysed I may mention that 
fragments of bone continued to be extruded for some time 
He was not trephined A rather notable case of fracture of 
the thigh is still in the wards A wedgeshaped fragment 
was as shown by radiography forced out of the line of con 
tinuity and lodged against the edges of the two portions of 
the bone forming a sort of buttress to the broken limb at

the line of fracture There was a complete loss of continuity 
for an inch or more other smaller fragments coming away 
It was first put up in a Bavarian then in a Hodgen splint 
and later for a time on Stevensons sliding panels It has 
done well is in excellent position and is only showing 1 inch 
shortening not a bad result considering the extensive com 
minution A case mentioned by me before of a gunshot 
wound evidently passing the spleen is now convalescent 
These are practically all the surgical cases of any interest 
Numbers of convalescents from the station hospital and 
various cases from the ships have lately been sent to 
Wgnberg 
SCARLET FEVER AMONG THE CIV 
I omitted to mention in the proper place that three men 
of the City Imperial Volunteers have been lately admitted to 
the station hospital with scarlet fever How they got it is 
not quite clear They were all sent in from the Green Point 
Camp The first was attacked eight days after arrival This 
would be twentyfour days after leaving England and eighteen 
from Madeira The other two showed signs two days later 
The three men did not occupy the same tent in camp All 
three are slight cases indeed in the two diagnosis would 
have been very doubtful had it not been for the concurrence 
with the others 
THE RAMC 
One point of administration must not be omitted the 
amount of interest taken in actual executive work by the 
principal medical officers of the Army Corps and the lines I 
mean that they are not only constantly inspecting and making 
every detail fit in with every other but that they keep well 
in touch with the treatment of cases and continually give 
very valuable hints to the officers in charge Colonel Steven 
son is continually at Wynberg and practically supervises the 
surgical work there The amount of travelling about which 
the SurgeonGeneral seems to get through is remarkable 
VOLUNTARY AID 
Voluntary effort is moving along well The work has now 
been divided the Red Cross taking the wounded at the front 
the Good Hope the base and the Absentminded Beggar Fund 
the home ships 
WOUNDED FROM SPION KOP

ARRIVAL OF THE WOUNDED AT CAPETOWN 
THE hospital ship Spartan arrived on February sth from Dur 
ban with ISO sick and Lwounded and the Lismore Castle on 
February 6th with 120 The speedy way in which these men 
were entrained in an hour and ahalf and a little over an hour 
respectively says much for the energy and skill of Major 
Tatham RAMC disembarkation medical officer whose 
duty it is to superintend their removal from the ship to the 
train which is run alongside and in which they proceed to 
the general hospitals at Rondebosch and Wynberg 
SomE FORTuNATE CONVALESCENTS 
Many of the men wournded at Spion Kop on January 25th 
are today February ioth practically well amongst them 
are two cases of penetrating wound of the lung in which the 
bullet passed clean through the cheat and out at the back 
another man was shot through the liver and two men were 
shot in the inguinal region the bullet passing out at the 
buttock What is the cause of this marvellous recuperation 
in wounds of such severity First the Mauser bullet is very 
small and makes a clean wound the exit very little larger 
than the entrance and totally different from the Snider or 
MartiniHenry bullets which inflicted terrible wounds com 
pared to those we see here Secondly the bullet passes into 
the body at a high temperature and is practically aseptic 
leaving an aseptic track in its course hence there is nothing 
so to speak to heal The XRay Department at No i General 
Hotpital Wynberg has done some admirable work and the 
series of skiagraphs taken by Mr Catling will form one of the 
most interesting surgical records of the war

THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
XVI 
THE RELIEF OF LADYSMITH 
NOT only has the tide turned in South Africa it is now in full 
flood One success has followed another culminating in the 
relief of Ladysmith The raising of the siege so long con 
ducted against this gallant little town has evoked expressions 
of the wildest enthusiasm not only from every corner of the 
British Empire but from the AngloSaxon world Last week 
we had to record the sufferings endured by the besieged in 
Kimberley They were great but those endured in Lady 
smith were still greater In this hour of relief we cannot 
refrain from turning for a moment to the eloquent description 
of one of the most gifted victims of the siege Thus in his 
last letter Steevens wrote 
Poor Ladysmith deserted in its markets repeopled in its wastes here 
ripped with iron splinters there rising again into rail roofed rockwalled 
caves trampled down in its gardens manured where nothing can ever 
grow skirts hemmed with sand bags and bowels bored with tunnels 
Where people should be the long long day from dawn to daylight shows 
only a dead blankWhere no people should be in the clefts at the river 
bank in bald patches of veld ringed with rocks in overgrown ditches 
all these you find alive with men and beasts The place that a month ago 
was only fit to pitch empty meat tins into Is now Priceless stable room 
two squadrons of troop horses packed flank to flank inside its shelter 
Such was Ladysmith for four weary months Men women 
and children dwelling not in the dwelling places of the town 
but in halfburied tents pnder slopes of rocks in the midst 
of ddbris perforce sharing the dongas dark corners and waste 
spaces with the sewage and wreckage of the town Their food 
grew ever less and less Their water befouled by the besieging 
Boers became more and more pestiferous and for want of fuel 
the inhabitants could not even adopt the precaution of boiling 
it Gaunt worn weary but never despondent the garrison 
held on Men died like sheep of disease The weakness of 
hunger was constantly increasing ammunition had been 
almost expended the last gasp seemed nigh at hand until 
at length relief came  And ever upon the topmost roof our 
banner of England blew 
Some few special correspondents have already sent through 
accounts of relief thus supplementing the very brief official 
despatches containing its announcement The best we have 
seen is contributed to the Standard This correspondent 
tells us that the garrison which has for four months defended 
Ladysmith is now but a shadow of the force as it existed on 
October 30th I899 There is hardly a man but bears evidence 
of the physical sufferings and the mental torture of the siege 
Since the investment there have been lost in action i6 officers 
and I62 men The casual bombardment has killed R officers 
and men and wounded 20 officers and i68 men 47 officers and 
360 men of whom 94 have since died have been wounded in 
ction and disease has accounted for 476 more a figure which 
implies a greater loss of life of permanent injury to health 
than all the battles assaults and sorties Enteric fever 
low fever and dysentery have been rampantthe direct 
utnome of bad water privations and fcetid dust No fewer 
bhan 8424 out of a total of 21ooo halfstarved inhabitants 
hiave passed through the hospitals and the daily average 
inder treatment ranged from I500 to 2000 There were 1710 
3ases of enteric fever alone Some of the regiments indeed 
10ow can muster only a quarter of their former strength and 
some time must elapse for careful nursing and proper feeding 
efore they can be fit for duty The once dashing cavalry 
rigade has practically ceased to exist At the beginning of 
ihe year the garrison had 55oo horses and 4500 mules 
3efore the end of January they could only feed I1O0 the 
emainder had either been converted into food or been 
eft to forage for themselves These emaciated animals 
nere phantoms were among the most painful sights 
If the siege The same correspondent adds that the 
oombardment throughout the siege was heavy but on 
he whole ineffectlve It was estimated that 12000 
hells had been thrown into the townan average of 
tons of explosives dailyyet only 35 men were killed and 
88 wounded by the shelling The lessons which may be 


MARCH 10 1900I THE WOUNDED AT WOOLWICH I DICL 0 603 
learned both from the experienoe here and at Kimberley and 
we fear in Mafeking are of the highest military importance 
The effect of shelling is to be found not so much in the actual 
destruction or maiming of men as in the conditions of life 
which continual bombardment entails Buried in holes in 
drains and subterranean shelters of every description the 
health of the garrison must soon suffer and doubtless many 
of the deaths from disease may be directly attributed to the 
artillery fire and the dark unhealthy refuges in which it com 
pelled the inhabitants to dwell On the water supply from 
the Klip River the correspondent of the Morning Leader 
writes It is thick with putrid animal matter and the 
water has in it suspended fibre something like beef tea the 
sewage of the Boer camps 
Dr Jameson who has been doing excellent service during 
the siege was seized with enteric fever on February 14th 
after nursing his servant through an illness He is said to 
have only a slight attack and to be doing well A mnessage 
which a telegraphist from Natal despatched from Colenso 
during the bombardment tells with graphic if somewhat 
grim humour its story IHear gun ran cover platform 
shell burst rum work Today March 6th a message 
direct from Ladysmith sent by Mr Treves which appears 
elsewhere in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL bears further 
witness to the deplorable condition of the town 
BOER AMBULANCES 
The Times published an interesting telegram from St 
Petersburg dated March ist in which it is stated that the 
Dutch Committee there received news from Piofessor 
Korteweg Surgeon at the University Clinic at Amsterdam 
who has recently returned home aftertwomonths with the 
Boers He states that 
hitherto there have been six foreign sanitarydetachments or ambulancep 
on the Boer sidenamely two Dutch one of these beingfrom Java and the 
other four respectively from Belgium France Germany and Russia The 
second Russian ambulance fitted out by public subscription which has 
notyet reached its destination will be the seventh The Englisb it is 
stated have splendidly equippedhospitals for their own wounded at Pre 
toria The foreign doctors and nurses had great difficulty in finding out 
where their services would be most required as the Boer officials refuse 
all information and General Joubert declined for strategical reasons to 
indicate where fighting was likelyto take place Strangers were therefore 
left to shift for themselves and had to depend uponi thie information of 
private persons Another difficulty was tle want of confidence among 
the Boers in all Europeans The Boer will on no account accept assist 
ance from a European doctor if he can possibly help it It would seem 
from this and other accounts that the display of sentiment and sacriflce 
of money in sending medical aid to the Transvaal have so far been lost on 
the Boers When the professorwas last at the seat of war in the middle 
of January the Doer loses had been very insignifant not more than 
350 killed and oowounded from the beginning of the war The great 
majority of wounds were caused by explosive shells During the month 
that the professor was present at the siege of Ladysmith he performed 
about 40 surgical operations 
The want of confidence among the Boers in Europeans here 
referred to may seem curious but knowing the Boers as I do 
I have not the least doubt that the statement is accurate 
The Boer has a deepseated suspicion and distrust of all 
strangers It is a trait which he has in common with the 
natives and is due to various causes the chief being the 
isolated life ignorance and continuous native environment 
SHIELDS AND THE MAGAZINE RIFLE 
The accounts which have appeared from distinguisbed sur 
geons in South Africa as well as your correspondents descrip 
tion of the cases at Netley show the ready way in which 
almost every wound made by a small modern bullet heals 
Thqs the lungs the liver the abdominal organs and even 
occasionally the brain appear to have been penetrated and 
the wounds recovered from in most cases with greatrapidity 
The one organ which cannot recover from even the bullet of 
the Mauser rifle appears to be the heart As was pointed out 
by Mr Jonathan Hutchinson an efficient heart shield 
would thus save a great many lives and such a shield one of 
our correspondents bas modelled and it is now being 
experimented upon Weighing under 4 lbs it is designed to 
be worn under the tunic and without in any appreciable way 
interfering with the free movements of the soldier 
to diminish considerably his risk of being killed The diffi 
culty will be to obtain a shield sufficiently light to stop the 
bullet at short ranges and an effort to find something which 
will combine the maximum resisting power with the minimum 
of weight is now being made by an eminent firm of engineers 
Mr BenettStanford late Lieutenant the iat Royal Dragoons 
who is now at Modder River in a letter to the Western 
Morning News writes of the battle of Magersfontein and in a 
reflection on the lessons which this conflict conveyed clearly 
indicates his advocacy of some form of shield He says 
Messrs Cummel of Sheffield have constructed a small sbield 
of Harveyised steel which has been patented by Mr Boynton 
and only weighs about 51 lbs this shield he says is I foot 
9 inc es in width and i foot 5 inches in height and only 
inch in thickness and gives protection against modern rifle 
lire at pointblank range besides whieh it forms an excellent 
rifle rest so that a force attacking a position with this shield 
unle8ss there is a crossfire could calculate on reducing the loss 
of men by 6o or 70 per cent When the infantry had got up to 
charging distance of the enemies trenches tbe shield could 
easily be slipped off by merelyreleasing a catch and depressing 
the muzzle of the rifle It would be the old game of guns 
versus armour as in the case of the navy of the present day 
It would be curious if in the twentieth century we went back 
to the ideas of the twelfth century of defending a man with 
armour from the missiles of his enemies The deecription at 
least suggests that some such device might be used with 
advantage 
In the Daily Mail of February roth another form of shield 
is described which it is said may be possibly sent to South 
Africa This shield is somewhat heavier than the one de 
scribed by Mr BenettStanford and is known as the  Sbarp 
shooter It is said to be impervious to Mauser or Lee 
Metford bullets at 400 yards and to light machinegun fire at 
7oo yards it weighs X3 pounds and cannot be overturned by 
the impact of any number of bullets it is divided into two 
parts hinged together each weighing 64 pounds which can 
be made interchangeable It is intended for the use of 
marksmen onlynot more than about Io per cent of the 
infantry 
It is quite certain that the Germanslave long contemplated 
the necessity of some such protection against the territic hail 
from modern magazine rifles It is obvious that men who 
have to storm entrenchmentts must if they are to be on even 
terms with their opponents be provided with some readily 
movable form of cover and I cannot but believe that such a 
shield as a  Sharpshooter behind which a man might 
securely cover himself in a prone position and through a hole 
in which he can with safety and deliberation fire at his par 
tiallyconcealed opponent will eventually be adopted If the 
marksmen say 20 per cent of an attacking force were pro 
vided with an artificial cover of this sort and the rest of the 
men wore under their tunics a heart shield the frontal attack 
would be much more deadly to those holding the entrenched 
position and much less deadly to those making the attack 
than it is at present 
I note from the German book of musketry instruction that 
a steel shield for use in entrenchments is described as a por 
tion of routine military equipment and I am informed by a 
correspondent from South Africa that over many of their 
trenches the Boera actually have a sort of hinged lid of corru 
gated iron through which they protrude their rifles and which 
in a measure deflects bullets 
Our own book of musketry instruction makes no reference to 
any shield but the longer I study the accounts of the present 
campaign the more I feel convinced that in order to put our 
men on anything like even terms with the Boers when they 
attack them in position they must be provided in advancing 
with some artificial protection of a readily movable character 
such as the Boers obtain in fixed positions from trenches 
boulders and earthworke 
THE WOUNDED AT THE HERBERT HOSPITAL 
WOOLWICH 
Nature of the Wounds 
THE sS Avoca arrived at the Royal Albert Dock London on 
March 3rd The wounded on board were met by all the mem 
bers of the military medical staff of the Herbert Hospital 
Woolwicb and were quickly conveyed in a large number of 
ambulances to the hospital

and removal of bullets from the thigh amputation of the thigh 
above the knee amputation of the leg below the knee ampu 
tation of the wrist many cases of injury to the head and of 
penetrating wounds of the chest and many minor injuries of 
the limbs 
A Ca8e of intestinal Resection for Bullet Wound 
There are two cases of recovery from serious abdominal 
injuries One of these is very remarkable The man was 
wounded near Frere at about 4 AM on November 27th I899 
He arrived at the Convent Hospital Estcourt a distance of 
about twelve miles about lo AMl It was found that he had 
been wounded in the abdomen The posterior wound was 
about 3 inches above the right trochanter the anterior wound 
to the right of the middle line half way between the umbilicus 
and pubes Zaparotomy was at once done by Dr J E Neale 
civil surgeon The abdomen was full of blood the small 
intestine was found to be cut right across and there were four 
bullet wounds on each side of the cut edges A piece of in 
testine 15 inches long was resected an endtoend 
anastomosis done by CzernyLembert sutures A gauze drain 
wasinserted and double cyanide dressings used Transfusion 
was done with  per cent saline The patient was fed by 
rectal injections for fortyeight hours The drain was then 
removed He neverhada bad sign Hewas keptonslop diet 
for a month and enemata were used to keep the bowels regu 
lar The bullet had penetrated the iliac bone and must 
have injured some branches of the lumbar nerve as the right 
leg suffered slightly The patient was up and about gaining 
strength daily before he left Estcourt but great care was taken 
with his diet 
The Hospital Arrangements 
The accommodation for the wounded at present in the Her 
bert Hospital is very good indeed as the wards have all just 
recently been redecorated and equipped throughout The 
food for the invalids is of a very excellent quality and the 
majority are on medical comforts Great credit is due to the 
officers and to the civil staff of surgeons for the attention 
which is paid by them to the sick in the hospital We under 
stand that a great increase in hospital accommodation is 
about to be made at Woolwich

The Chairman then gave  The Guest Mr Victor Horsley 
He thanked him for having honoured the Society by coming 
at great personal inconvenience to be their guest for the 
evening briefly traced his career indicated the great value 
of his work in medicine and in surgery emphasised 
his influence in the sphere of medical politics and 
referred to his hobby archaeology The toast having 
been enthusiastically honoured Mr Horsley replied 
He had he said a lively recollection of the hospitable re 
ception the University had given him when they awarded him 
the Cameron Prize Referring to the complimentary remarks 
which the Chairman had made as to his work in surgery he 
said that it was true that he had done certain things for which 
the profession seemed never to cease thanking him though 
his share in what was called cranial surgery had not been so 
large as the Chairman had in his kindness inferred yet it was 
perfectly true that by experimental science alone had it been 
possible to do cranial surgery at all the profession was apt 
to forget the man to whom it owed all modern surgery includ 
iDg cranial surgery and he thought that in Edinburgh the 
name of Lord Lister ought to come first whenever any advance 
in surgery was mentioned It was true that most operations 
on the head were regarded as of necessity dangerous twenty 
years ago now it was known why and the application of the 
scientific principles which Lord Lister taught had made pos 
sible what all were proud to recognise as a distinct advance in 
surgery To the members of the Society it would be given to 
see the advances in professionaL knowledge which he was sure 
would occur during the next forty or fifty years In conclusion 
he thanked the members for their kind reception 
The toast of  The Royal Medical Society  was given by Pro 
fessor Simpson and Dr Mackie the Junior Prresident re 
plied 
 The University and Medical Corporations was given by 
Mr Victor Ilorsley who said It gives me very great pleasure 
to propose this toast and to couple with it the names of my 
friend and teacher Professor Scbafer and my friend 
tbough unfortunately not my teacher Professor Chiene 
The expression  Medical Corporations  I suppose we under 
stand to include the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Sur 
geons not only of this great city but of all the other metro 
politan cities in the United Kingdom the Medical Corpora 
tions in general distinguishing them from the Universities 
The unity of purpose existing in these institutions has not 
been obtained by an Act of Parliament nor is it ever likely 
to be attained by that means In some respects fortunately 
each University and each Medical Corporation preserves a 
certain tradition of its own and there is no University 
and no Medical Corporation more than the University 
of Edinburgh and the Royal Colleges of Physicians and 
Surgeons which have preserved distinguished traditions The 
history of the University shows that it has always been to the 
front in the advancement of medical science It is true that 
some one hundred and twenty years ago medical science was 
in a confused condition so far as its teaching was concerned 
but the lustre which Alexander Munro for example shed 
upon the University in the last century has been maintained 
by numerous distinguished men up to the present time 
When you come to the Medical Corporationsthe Colleges of 
this great city especiallyI must associate with them as I 
said before the other medical colleges and corporations 
in this kingdom because things at the present moment 
are in a very curious state In fact there is a sort of medical 
war going on in the least favoured part of the kingdomLon 
donwhere I am sure to your grief you will learn the twoCol 
leges have departed from what are called peaceful lines and 
are now going to strike off from their mother for a kind 
of stepmother who has been forced upon them Yes that is 
unfortunately a fact The situation is this The Medical 
Corporations in this country have a certain duty to perform or 
they think they have to perform through their Councilsthe 
duty of examining some of us and deciding whether 
we are fit to be registered to practise At the preeent 
moment the Medical Corporations are attemping an 
impossible task Originally they were Guilds of a 


MLAROH a 1900 LITERARY NOTES   6o 
high order Originally they had powers disciplinary 
powers over the socalled apprentices which have 
disappeared into the background but they achieved 
a work at that time which had for its object the 
preservation and the advancement of medical science in 
addition to the more academic kind of work which the Uni 
versities were performing But since 1858 the position of 
those Corporations has been one of difficulty and almost a 
contradiction in terms for whereas they were supposed 
to continue those disciplinary measures and to go on 
with education hold examinations and grant quali 
fying diplomas they nevertheless have lost their primary 
position Since i858 the Medical Corporations have been 
placed by Acts of Parliament under the hierarchy of the 
body called the General Medical Council Their one desire 
is apparently both to be connected with the General Medical 
Council as a department of the Government and on the other 
hand to be free of the restrictions of the General Medical 
Council and the Colleges of Physi iians and Surgeons in 
London are banded together in a distinct revolt against 
the General Medical Council to such a degree that 
it is possible that students in London may find certain 
difficulties in obtaining qualifying diplomas from those 
bodies That is a very unfortunate state of things It 
seems to me that it is one which youmost of youwill have 
the chance and the duty in fact of putting an end 
to in future years I say future years advisedly 
because no medical reform can be achieved within 
thirty or forty years and as this is a fundamental reform 
any change in the political and social position of the great 
Corporations which have lasted for centuries is not likely to be 
attained in a short time If you ask me the solution 
of the difficulty I replythe oneportal system and 
I take it that Professor Chiene will say that it 
is the worst medicine he ever heard of that 
in fact it is a do3e which is likely to carry them off 
altogether I know perfectly well that many members of the 
councils of the various Corporations think honestly that the 
oneportal system would mean the total extinction of 
these venerable and muchtoberespected institutions 
Personally as a Fellow of one of those Colleges 
it is not likely that I should be in sympathy with anything 
calculated to lead to extinction of bodies which have done 
good work in the past and which I am convinced will do 
very good work in the future It is of course a 
fact that the  oneportal system would deprive the 
socalled Medical Corporations of a certain income 
now derived from the fees of candidates who present them 
selves for diplomas because the oneportal system would to a 
certain extent render some of these diplomas unnecessary 
but the commercial side of the question is not the 
one that should really appeal to us We have the 
brilliant example of the College of Physicians to the 
direct contrary because the College in their desire to pro 
mote medical science established a scientific laboratory 
They cannot do that without money and they cannot do that 
again if they have no endowments without the fees of can 
didates I quite admit all that but I say this that where a 
corporate body like the College of Physicians of Edinburgh 
has shown that it has such a wide grasp of the affairs 
of the profession when it goes out of its way to 
liave this laboratory it then takes upon itself public 
duties which it is the bounden duty of the public to 
support The public at present accept everything that 
the medical profession gives them but not with thankfulness 
They accept it almost as a matter of course I consider that 
those Medical Corporations who are thus performing public 
duties of great value such as the Colleges in Edinburgh and 
London have a claim on the State that their continuance 
and efficiency is a matter of importance to the State and to 
the furtherance of medical science What would be the result 
if this view were accepted and the oneportal system intro 
duced and those Corporations who do the work were sup 
ported by the State The result would be at once that we 
hould have an impetus given to medical study and science 
and the Universities would occupy their proper place Iam ery 
interested in this subject of medical education especiall r in 
its relation to the UnIiversities and the Medical Corporati ns 
which great bodies are too often brought as it were into com 
petition with each other whereas they ought simply both to 
be in the van of medical progress I hope you will accord to 
Professor Schafer and Professor Chiene the reception which a 
toast of this kind should carry Success and Prosperity to 
the University of Edinburgh and the Medical Corporations 
In reply Professor Schafer urged the claims of laboratories 
in connection with the Universitylaboratories that were not 
cast in an inflexible mould so that they could not be altered 
but laboratories capable of expansion modificamion and what 
not as the changes and advances in medicine and surgery 
demanded 
Professor Chiene referring to Mr Horsleys advocacy of the 
oneportal system said he did not see how the difficulty was 
to be overcome by the system He was however willing to 
learn and if it were proved to him that the oneportal system 
was the best he trusted he was not too old to learn 
The toast of The Royal Infirmary was given by Dr 
Comrie and Dr Smart replied 
Professor Chiene proposed the toast of The Chairman 
Dr W J Barclay Hs was a Colonial a New Zealander and 
they were specially proud of him at this time They all re 
gretted the absence of the Senior President Dr A Dingwall 
Fordyce but they must warmly compliment Dr Barclay on 
his excellent conduct in the chair

In the Revue des Deux Mondes M le Dr A Kuyper deputy 
to the StatesGeneral of Holland concludes an article on the 
South African crisis wroitten from the Dutch point of view in 
the following words 
Perhaps England may succeed in disarming the men but she will never 
be able to destroy the fertility of the female Boer In less than a century 
thanks to this extraordinary fertility 6ooco Boers have grown to half a 
million In the coming centurY they will increase to 3 4 5 millions and 
South Africa will be theirs The wife of General Joubert who accom 
panies her husband to the battlefield is the perfect type of the Boer wife 
whose fecundity is unequalled and who knows how to inspire all her 
children with the national virtue So long as the Transvaal ioness sur 
rounded with her cubs roars against England from the heights of the 
Dralenberg the Boers will never be brought into subjection
