THE MILITARY MEDICAL SERVICE 
The Council of the British Medical Association at its last 
meeting adopted a report on the Military Medical Services 
which had been sent up by the Parliamentary Bills Conv 
mittee The report which is published as a special 
supplement to this issue of the Journal was drafted by 
a Subcommittee of experts upon which the medical 
officers of the auxiliary forces were represented and which 
was presided over by SurgeonGeneral Hamilton The 
suggestions contained in the report are therefore of a 
thoroughly practical character and will we trust 
receive the sympathetic consideration of the Secretary of 
State for War 
The substance of the report falls under two headsthe 
medical services of the regular and auxiliary forces 
but also touches on the Indian Medical Service which 
cannot of course be left out of account in any considera 
tion of the needs of military service of the Empire 
The regular service is dealt with both generally and 
specifically and fairly exhaustively Although the general 
causes which make it unpopular and keep it undermanned 
were well known at least to experts the subcommittee 
wisely determined as a preliminary to the consideration 
of the subject to ascertain the views of the medical 
colleges aod schools throughout the kingdom A large 
number of replies were received and as will be seen from 
the analyses of answers given in the report there is prac 
tical unanimity on one point namely that undermanning 
lies at the root of the drawbacks and consequent unpopu 
larity of the service 
From this one cause there result a host of evils such as 
overwork of individuals harassing changes of stations and 
duties undue prolongation of terms of foreign service in 
sufficient ordinary leave and no possibility of leave for 
the improvement of professional knowledge Insufficient 
pay in junior ranks is indicated as one of the chief causes 
of this undermanning It appears that the pay cannot 
be made to cover unavoidable expenses and it is therefore 
faeld that an increase in pay must precede any successful 
tilling up of establishments This difficulty has been ren 
dered acute by the fact that the army has now to compete 
with the increased emoluments which assistants have in 
recent years been able to command in civil life 
Notwithstanding successive augmentations of the army 
during past decades with consequent increase of duties atj 
home and abroad the medical service is at present about 
200 under what it was forty years ago Furthi ithas now 
 to provide for the militia as the 300 militia surgeons of 
that period have all but died out Taking the two branches 
together there are now actually 500 fewer medical officers 
than in the early Sixties 
The processes of the official mind are often inscrutable 
and it is therefore difficult to determine the reason 
that has led to these two services being allowed to fall 
into so lamentable a condition unless it be mistaken trust 
in a socalled 
 
Reserve formed about thirteen years ago by 
the simple procedure of counting the medical officers of the 
auxiliary forces two or three times over in separate lists 
The fallacy in the constitution of such a reserve was pointed 
out at the time of its formation and since then the atten 
tion of successive War Ministers has been drawn to the 
matter The Committee points to the fact that this Medical 
Reserve was not called up during the Boer war as proof 
that the authorities did not regard it as a reserve in the 
true sense of the word If by 
 
national emergency 
 
in 
vasion only is meant it would be of even less value as 
then the officers would have to join their respective corps on 
mobilisation The cogency of this reasoning cannot be 
gainsaid but we could have wished that the Committee 
had seen its way to suggest some definite scheme for a 
genuine reserve It must be admitted that the task of 
forming a reserve of civil practitioners tied down by private 
and personal responsibilities which perhaps exceed those 
of any other class in the community is very difficult 
Among the conditions which are mentioned as operating 
to deter young men from entering the Army Medical 
Service the character of the present entrance examination 
is mentioned It was instituted at a time when the 
diplomas of the licensing bodies in the United Kingdom 
were granted after a curriculum and examination very 
different from those now required It must be remem 
bered that for years past competition for commissions in 
the Army Medical Service has practically ceased owing to 
the fact that the number of candidates has not as a rule 
equalled the number of vacancies The report recom 
mends that in place of competition which has become 
inoperative candidates for the Royal Army Medical Corps 
should be recommended by the various constituted 
authorities of the profession the universities colleges and 
schools It is believed that in this wav the class of men 
best suited for the army would be obtained As an aid 
to the successful application of this principle the forma 
tion of medical cadet corps at the various medical schools 
is suggested 
It would be useless to attempt to forecast how this sug 
gestion of the abolition of open competition will be re 
ceived by the authorities Competition is assuredly no 
longer the popular fetish it was thirty years ago though 
there is still much to be said in its favour It is the fact 
however that in the army medical service it has practically 
ceased to exist and the situation thus created has to be 
dealt with It is clear that competition and nomination 
cannot be carried on as they now are side by side One 
of them must go  and as the former has already in practice 
ceased there seems to be no alternative but nomination 
The true army status of medical officers still seems doubt 
ful in the schools notwithstanding the granting of military 
titles in a Royal Corps this is doubtless due at least in part to

distrust of the military authorities from whom these conces 
sions Were wrung virtually by force and who still try to mini 
mise them in various ways What is not at all doubtful 
however is that should any illadvised meddling with the 
rank and titles of army medical officers now be attempted 
under the name of reform the result will be an abject 
failure that will cover the responsible Minister with shame 
as with a garment and lead to a state of things that will 
entail heavy cost to the overburdened taxpayer and too pro 
bably also inuch preventable suffering on our troops 
The report contains some valuable suggestions as to 
reorganisation of the headquarter and district medical 
staffs The pay and position of such a highplaced officer 
as that of DirectorGeneral are inadequate while his staff 
has been cut down much below the strength fixed for years 
under the recommendation of the Sidney Herbert Commis 
sion of 1858 
The addendum dealing with the Indian Medical Service 
recoinmends its amalgamation with the home service in so 
far as military duties in India are concerned  but the 
subject is much too wide to be now discussed 
That part of the report which deals with the auxiliary 
forces contains in its first section the uncomprising state 
ment that 
 
organisation in the sense of preparation for 
the medical requirements of a large force on taking the 
field can hardly be said to exist in any branch of the 
auxiliary service We venture to hope that this pro 
nouncement will receive the serious attention of the War 
Office for the tone of this part of the report shows that 
those best acquainted with the actualities and possibilities 
of the situation are much impressed by the many diffi 
culties which must attend any attempt to provide an 
efficient medical service for the great auxiliary army for 
home defence contemplated in the scheme of the Govern 
ment Provision has to be made for the Militta the 
Yeomanry and the Volunteers and the report is quite 
clear upon the point that the medical organisation for the 
auxiliary forces must be regimental as well as depart 
mental The organisation of the units of militia 
yeomanry and volunteers makes a unified medical 
service as in the regular army impossible though it 
does not preclude the maintenance and development of 
the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps On the contrary the 
report recommends that bearer companies and hospital 
companies sufficient for the whole volunteer force if 
mobilised into brigades divisions and army corps should 
be organised during peace for training and that the 
existing companies of the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps 
and the brigade bearer companies represent the nucleus 
of such an organisation It is further recommended that 
the medical services for the whole of the auxiliary forces 
should be organised on similar lines but kept as separate 
branches and made quite independent of the Royal Army 
Medical Corps 
Into the details of the scheme suggested in the report it 
would be premature to enter here They will at least form 
a basis for discussion and for further elaboration as the 
situation becomes clearer But we cannot refrain from 
drawing attention to the very different conceptions formed 
by the War Office and by the expert subcommittee of the 
British Medical Association as to the needs of the yeo 
manry The War Office considers that one medical officer 
will be sufficient for each regiment and does not appear tc 
contemplate any coordinating departmental organisation 
The report of the subcommittee of experts assigns two sur 
geons to each regiment and a supernumerary surgeon to 
relieve the strain on the two regimental officers during the 
annual training It recommends also a yeomanry medi 
cal staff corps of 250 medical officers with mounted 
brigade bearer companies properly equipped for service 
with cavalry 
We have before expressed the opinion that augmentation 
and reorganisation of the military medical services should 
not and cannot be long delayed It is most important how 
ever that nothing should be done hastily or without full 
consideration of the needs of the army and the peculiar 
exigencies of medical practice We believe that the sub 
ject would be best threshed out by a committee on which 
the War Office the military medical services the teachers 
in medical schools and the general body of the medical 
profession in the three kingdoms were fairly represented 
Mr Brodrick has as we have already pointed out plenty 
of theoretical advisers inside as well as outside the 
medical profession but we trust that he will listen with 
caution to theoretical reformers who are not in touch with 
and have no real knowledge of the services and who seem 
to imagine that the medical profession can be drawn upon 
at any time to any extent that may suit the requirements 
of the moment or the parsimony of Parliament Unless 
service is to be made compulsory this is simply a gratuitous 
assumption and any scheme of provision for the emer 
gencies of war or even for foreign service in time of peace 
based upon it must inevitably fall to pieces at the fipst 
impact of hard fact 
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONSUMPTIVE 
The effect of bodily disease on the mind is a compara 
tively unexplored region of psychology We indeed 
believe in a general way that longcontinued severe pain 
may derange the reason  that cutaneous irritation may give 
rise to a kind of frenzy  that gout engenders an almost 
savage irascibility  that dyspepsia obfuscates the intellect 
and engenders spiritual gloom that a disordered liver 
breeds melancholy  that a loaded colon disables the judg 
ment  that fissure or fistula of the anus causes a peculiar 
irritability of temper These facts suggest that every 
organic lesion and indeed every pathological condition 
may reflect itself in a corresponding mental disturbance 
so as to supply a scientific basis for the charitable maxim 
 
Tout comprendre cest tout pardonner 
An interesting contribution to this field of clinical research 
has been made by Dr Maurice Letulle who in a recent num 
ber of the Archives Gnrales de Mdecine gives the result 
of an investigation which he has lately carried out as to the 
psychology of phthisis In the early stage before the 
disease has caused extensive ravages the intellectual apti 
tudes according to this observer are in young patients 
usually well preserved Sometimes they seem to be 
exalted to an extent that may alarm the friends Mean 
while the physical strength gradually wanes the pallor of 
the face wasting want of appetite and anaemia being in 
strong contrast with the mental energy 
There may be an active intellectual hyperexcitability
