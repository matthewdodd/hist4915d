THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE BATTLE OF TUGELA COLENSO 
By FREDERICK TREVES FRCS 
Consulting Surgeonwiththe Forces 
FRERE CAMP 
IT was from Frere Camp that the army under General 
Buller started for the Tugela River Frere is merely a 
station on the line of rail which traverses Natal and as it 
consists only of some four houses it can hardly be dignified 
by the name of hamlet These few singlestorey houses had 
been very thoroughly looted by the Boers and in one of them 
the stationmasters housethe General had his headquar 
ters Frere is simply a specka corrugated iron oasisin 
the vast undulating plains of the veld On the way to Lady 
smith are a few large kopjes from any one of which the 
line of the Tugela River can be seen with the hills beyond 
occupied by the Boer entrenchments and over them again 
the hills which dominate Ladysmith There was no shade 
of any kind and as the weather was exceptionally hot the 
camp was not precisely comfortable The inconvenience 
of a continued sunglare was intensified by constant clouds 
of brown dust and by the scarcity of water On the other 
hand the evenings were cool and the early mornings 
delightful 
The river which is reputed to  run  through Frere had 
long since ceased to run The water was retained by 
certain dams and the pools thus formed were not over 
numerous The water was the colour of peasoup and when 
in a glass was semiopaque and of a faint brownish colour 
It soon blocked a Berkefeld filter the pencil of which had 
to be cleaned after each water bottle had been pumped full 
The filtered water was pleasant enough to the taste In 
the lowest pool immediately above the iron railway bridge 
which had been blown up by the Boers Tommy Atkins 
could bathe in what seerned to be a lightcoloured mud 
Here also he washed his socks and his shirts 
We came up to FrereI and my two nurseswith No 4 
Stationary Field Hospital This hospital was under the 
very able direction of Major Kirkpatrick and did splendid 
service The other officers were Major Mallins and 
Lieutenant Simson of the RAMC than whom none 
could be more efficient We reached the camp on the 
Monday before the battle when it was reputed that 30000 
men were under canvas A camp of this size of necessity 
presented an endless scene of bustle and movement 
Nothing seemed to be at rest but the interminable array of 
white tents and the rows of baggage waggons Cavalry 
would be moving in one direction and infantry in another 
Here a mounted patrol would be riding out or a couple of 
scouts coming in Gallopers would be seen in all direc 
tions and everywhere would be a struggling team of oxen 
or of mules enveloped in clouds of dust and urged on by 
sweating men and strange oaths The camp during the 
day lay dry dusty parched and restless under a blazing sun 
but at night there was a cool wind and cheery camp fires and 
a darkness which blotted out the dusty roads the driedup 
river the dismal piles of stores and the general picture of 
a camp in a desert of baked earth Every night a search 
light was at work sending despatches to Ladysmith and 
almost every morning could be heard the Boer guns 
thundering over that unhappy place Tommy Atkins 
looked very smart in his khaki suit when leaving Waterloo 
Station or when embarking at Southampton but at Frere 
he showed the effects of wear and his tunic his belt his 
pouches his boots and his face had all toned down to one 
uniform tint of dirt colour HeVwas of the earth earthy 
Even his brown face and red neck were well powdered with 
the common dust but nothing seemedto have blotted out 
his cheerfulness and his determination to make the best 
of even a camp on the veld 
BEFORE THE BATTLE 
On Wednesday the army began to move forward to 
Chieveley and on Thursday the whole camp had nearly 
vanished aad little remained but smouldering fires of 
camp refuse the inevitable dust the inevitable sun and 
the inevitable Kaffir 
From a kopje some three miles beyond therethe kopje 
from which the Boers fired upon the illfated armoured 
trainthe new camp at Chieveley could be seen The 
baggage train which followed the army was eight miles in 
length This train was made up mainly of waggons drawn 
by teams of oxeneighteen to each waggon The last bearer 
company was well out of sight in the new camp before the 
last waggonscarrying pontoonshad started The course 
of this enormous caravan across the veld was marked by a 
line of brown dust which gave one the idea that the very 
road was smoking under this unwonted burden 
From the kopje we could see the firing of the great naval 
guns and the clouds of dust sent up by the exploding shells 
and now and then from the weary road would come an 
attenuated sound which was all that reached us of the 
shrill yells of the nigger drivers whose dustdried throats 
gave out noises like the shrieks of parrots 
DURINGX THE BATTLE 
On Friday morning No 4 Stationary Hospital movc 
up hurriedly to Chieveley To our numbers had been 
added two Netley sisters whose skill devotion and 
unselfishness were soon taxed to the utmost On the way 
up it was evident that the battle was raging The roar of 
the big gans was incessant and rising above their solemn 
boom was the sharp irritable crack of the quickfiring 
ordnance When I reached Chieveley Station where the 
hospital was to be pitched a message arrived asking me to 
go down to the field of battle at once I went down in a 
mule waggon immediately Our hospital was about three 
and three quarter miles from the Naval Hill on which our 
big guns were pitched Close behind the ridge formed by 
this hill were four field hospitals The scene presented 
at this spot was beyond description The men were 
coming in as fast as the ambulances and bearers could 
bring them Some were dead some were dying all were 
parched with thirst and baked and blistered with heat 
The men were lying on all sides on stretchersamidst tents 
piles of rifles accoutrements battered helmets and blood 
stained tunics It was a sight no one would wish to see 
again and the blazing sun added to the miseries of all 
Some 8oo wounded were passed through the field hospitals 
and dealt with by sixteen surgeons Those who harshly 
criticise the Army Medical Department should have seenm 
the work done on that memorable Friday on the Naval Hill 
before Colenso No work could have been done better 
The equipment was good the arrangements elaborated 
and the officers worked on hour after hour without 
rest or food under the most trying possible conditions 
No greater strain could have fallen upon a department and 
all concerned met the brunt of it valiantly and well One 
could not be other than proud of ones profession 
The system of dealing with the wounded had been 
very carefully worked out by the Principal Medical 
Officer Colonel Gallwey CB and to his foresight and 
preparation the perfect working of the hospitals on 
the day of the battle is due In addition to the 
ordinary bearer companies Colonel Gallwey had or 
ganised a volunteer ambulance corps of some 2000 tmen 
disposed in the proportion of twelve men to a stre cher 
It was intended that these bearers should convey the more 
seriously wounded from the field so that they might be 
spared the jolting of the ambulance waggons over the 
somewhat rough ground Not only did the bearers do this 
and so save infinite suffering but all Friday night and 
Saturday they were carrying the graver cases from the 
field hospitals to the stationary hospital at Chieveley So 


220 IJOUNA  MR TREVES ON THE BATTLE OF COLENSO JAN 27 1900 
admirably was the stretcher work done that not a single 
wounded man was left upon the field after dark on Friday 
AFTER THE BATTLE 
Oar hospital at Chieveley was crammed to its utmost and 
ery many wounded men had to lie all night in the open 
Fortunately the nights on Friday and Saturday were very 
fine and there was a bright moon 
The work on Friday and Saturday was the heaviest I 
have ever experienced and we all suffered a good deal 
from thirst The nurses worked not only all day but also 
all night Some hundreds of wounded soldiers will have 
reason to remember their devotion that day and how well 
they succeeded in rendering a little more tolerable a state 
ol misery which was horrible to contemplate 
IN THE DONGA 
After a heavyafternoon on thefield I returned toChieveley 
Field Hospital in the evening but had hardly got in when a 
galloper arrived to ask me to see Lieutenant Roberts who 
had just been brought back I returned at once with a 
full equipment of instruments and much regret that that 
valiant soldier was from the first quite beyond the reach of 
surgery In addition to a penetrating wound of the abdo 
men his forearm was shattered by a Mauser and his knee 
wounded by a shell He was pulseless I slept outside 
his tent that night and saw him up to Chieveley on Satur 
4day morning He never rallied nor regained a pulse and 
zdied on Saturday at midnight Before he was brought in 
he had been lying for seven hours in the sun in a donga 
Here he was attended to by Major Babtie RAMC who 
rode into the donga through a hail of bullets and whose 
horse was killed under him Major Babtie kept by the many 
wounded men in the donga until the battle was over and as 
he alone had water in his water bottle he doled out 
water to each man in a minim measure i drachm to each 
The courage and daring of Major Babtie on this occasion 
calls for some recognition from the medical profession if 
not from the military authorities 
THE HEAT 
On Sunday we had to leave Chieveley as the hospital 
was within reach of the Boer shells We therefore retired 
to our previous pitch at Frere The hospital tents at 
Chieveley were admirably situated but the work was much 
hampered by want of water The temperature on Friday 
and Saturday was up to IOO F in the shade On Monday 
the temperature rose to IO40 F in the shade A clinical 
thermometer in a bag and under cover of a tent registered 
0450 F 
DEATH OF CAPTAIN HUGHES 
One very sad episode of the battle was the death of 
Captain Hughes RAMC Surgeon to General Buller 
He was riding to the aid of the wounded when he was 
shot through the root of the neck and died in 30 minutes 
He was an able surgeon a charming companion and a 
most amiable and popular man He was beloved by 
everyone in his corps and had a distinguished career be 
fore him 
THE HO3PITAL TRAINS AND SHIPS 
Themethod of dealing with the wounded in the Natal 
Field Force is as follows The railwaya single lineis 
open as far as Chieveley and on it are two admirably 
equipped hospital trains in charge of the indefatigable and 
everobliging Major BrazierCreagh RAMC The hospital 
train was on the field before daybreak on Saturday morning 
and was soon filled with wounded Some few of these 
were landed at the No 4 Stationary Field Hospital at 
Chieveley the rest were taken on to Estcourt and Maritz 
burg At both these towns but especially at Maritzburg 
there is very excellent hospital accommodation The 
base hospital alone at MaritzburK can take in IIOO patients 
and besides there is the large military hospital at the Col 
lege Greys Hospital and the hospital for volunteers estab 
lished at the Legislative Assembly 
From Maritzburg the patients are sent down to Durban 
by the hospital train and are then conveyed to Cape Town 
by the hospital ship Spartan which is under the charge of 
Major Woodhouse RAMC From the careful examina 
tion I made of her when I boarded herat Durban I should 
think she was the bestequipped and bestmanaged hospi 
tal ship afloat 
Colonel Gallweys organisation has now been tested to the 
utmost and has been proved to be efficient and admirable 
Those in England who have friends among the army in 
Natal may rest assured that the wounded are well looked 
after and that the arrangements for their comfort leave 
little to be desired The wounded placed upon the hospital 
train by the Naval Hill below Chieveley could haveas 
soon as they were placed in their berthsiced soda water 
and whisky iced milk hot soup or even champagne and 
seltzer It is no matter of wonder that Major Brazier 
Creagh is proud of his train to which he has devoted so 
much labour and thought 
The strain of the work at Durban falls upon Major 
McCormack RAMC who has charge of the base depot 
medical stores and whoafter weeks of hard work has 
brought his department to a perfect degree of businesslike 
efficiency 
MAUSER BULLET WOUNDS 
The great majority of the wounds are by Mauser bullets 
some few are due to fragments of shell and a still less 
number to shrapnel The Mauser bullet is a very merciful 
one and in no instance have I met with a case in which 
the head of the bullet had been cut off as had been asserted 
by some The damage done by the Mauser depends mainly 
upon the range At I500 to 2000 yards it penetrates like 
a needle At 5oo yards or less it will smash a femur or a 
humerus to fragments When a bone is fractured the 
bulletif retainedis generally found to be much dis 
torted or broken up into many fragments The shell 
generally peels off the leaden core 
As an instance of the fine hitting of the Mauser I may 
mention a case from the armoured train in which the 
bullet went through the middle phalanges of the ring and 
little fingers making four small wounds which healed 
kindly and neatly The two bones were fractured but the 
man recovered with sound union and mobile joints On 
the other hand I have seen a fracture of the humerus in 
which the bone was broken into twentythree small frag 
ments Many gunshot fractures of the thigh heal by first 
intention 
ABDOMINAL WOUNDS 
The point of entry of the Mauser is very smalloften as 
Tommy says like a bugbite it is not difficult to over 
look The point of exit is also often very small but is 
more apt to be slitlike Several patients have been shot 
through the abdomen without inconvenience following 
In some of these the bowel has been penetrated as shown 
by blood in the motions The hole made in the bowel by 
the Mauser is very small and can be closed by from three 
to five Lemberts sutures Several penetrating wounds of 
the liver and kidney have been followed by no symptoms 
One distinguished officer had a shrapnel bullet pass 
through his liver and kidney He had little collapse and 
beyond some temporary tympanites and hEematuria he had 
no trouble of any kind 
BULLET WOUNDS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE 
In several instances the bullet has passed through the 
brain without causing marked symptoms and perfect re 
covery has followed For example a bullet entered near 
the vertex passed through the brain hard palate and buc 
cal cavity and escaped at the root ofithe neck on the oppo 
site side No discomfort followed except headache and 
3ome strabismus Speaking generally operations upon 
the skull for gunshot wound have done exceptionally well 


JAN 27 19oo THE MEDICAL SITUATION IN CAPE COLONY  Bntrve 221 
and such operations have been numerous I met with 4 
cases of paraplegia on Saturday the bullet having in each 
case apparently passed through the cord 
BULLET WOUNDS OF THE EXTREMITIES 
Amputations have been comparatively few I have seen 
a Mauser go through the centre of the patella and out at 
the centre of the popliteal space and lead to no trouble 
in the joint In another case the bullet went through the 
popliteal space from side to side and left the bone and 
joint untouched but led to an arteriovenous aneurysm 
BULLET WOUNDS OF THE CHEST 
After penetrating wounds of the lung there may be n1o symptoms beyond an immediate heemoptysis which iS 
not repeated In other instances there has been surgical 
emphysema or haemothorax apneumothorax and an exam 
ple or two of empyema On the whole gunshot wounds 
of the chest do well 
Some cases are hard to understand as for example one 
in which the bullet entered above the clavicle and came 
out on the inner side of the opposite thigh there being no 
symptom except temporary shock 
THE FIELD DRESSING 
The field dressing carried by each soldier answers its 
purpose admirably Tommy has a great regard for it and 
takes every care that he has it on him 
THE SPIRIT OF THE WOUNDED 
On all sides there is evidence that our soldiers behaved 
splendidly on the field and I can say that when brought 
back wounded they were plucky patient and uncomplain 
ing Their unselfishness was many times very marked 
An orderly was bringing some water to a wounded man 
lying on the ground near me He was shot through the 
abdomen and he could hardly speak owing to the dryness 
of his mouth but he said  Take it to my pal first he is 
worse hit than me This generous lad died next morning 
but his pal got through and is doing well 
FREDERICK TREVES 
FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT 
THE MEDICAL SITUATION AT THE BASE IN 
CAPE COLONY 
Capetown December 80th 1899 
THE BAE HOSPITALS AFTER LORD METHUENs ACTIONS 
THE newsthe rather scanty newsthat we get from England 
chiefly refers at present to the additional reinforcements that 
are coming out With military matters I am in no way con 
cerned but it is at least possible that the idea may obtain at 
home that the noncombatant departments may also stand in 
need of further augmentation and it is tolerably safe to 
assume that to the medical branch thoughts will be turned 
It maysave disappointment to many if the medical situation 
is explained At the moment of writing there are in round 
figures some IIoo patients in the three base hospitals No I 
and No 2 as the readers of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 
are aware are at Wynberg and No 3 atRondebesch The 
latter hospital has rather over Ioo cases which were brought 
down a day or two ago in the hospital ship Spartan from 
Natal No 3 therefore has at present more medical and 
nursing staff power than is required It is likely to fill up 
gradually and without any sudden strain being thrown on it 
After the engagements in the neighbourhood of the Modder 
River in which General Lord Methuens force took part there 
was for a time very great pressure on the base hospitals 
Nos I and 2 The nursing staff was hardly up to the 
strength calculated to meet such a sudden and serious 
strain In some respects the hospitals were incomplete 
thus the operating theatre of No 2 is still a marquee tent 
the building being still in the hands of the workmen Not 
withstanding Lthe severe pressure and in spite of the fact 
that in minor details the absolately smooth working that can 
only be looked for when the machine has been running for a 
little time was hard to secure these base hospitals met the 
emergency with comparative ease Hard work was entailed 
but that was precisely what every member of the staff was 
burning with anxiety to give and they asked for nothing 
better 
Meanwhile No 4 Hospital at present under ordErs to 
proceed to Natal has not as yet been called into requisi 
tion and there are two additional hospital ships the Lisnore 
and the Nubia which have been fitted here There is there 
fore a large margin allowed The wounded at all the three 
base hospitals broadly speaking do well and a large number 
of convalescents will shortly be ready to leave On all these 
grounds therefore it does not seem probable that any increase 
of the medical or nursing staff will be called for 
A WARNING TO VOLUNTEER NURSES 
Yet every steamer from England appears to bring ladies 
who seek in vain to obtain nursing employment in the hos 
pitals To such as are unacquainted with the methods of a 
military hospital and its manner of working the nursing staff 
appears inadequate Judging only by their experience when 
they have any of civil hospitals there appear abundant 
openings for more women workers The outflow of sympathy 
is strong and it seems almost cruel to point out that the 
resentment felt when applications are declined is highly un 
reasonable The long and short of it is that the RAMC is 
not in any need of more nursing power Were there any 
desire to appoint extra nurses of which there is not the 
slightest indication it is possible that the claims of the 
many nurses who under normal conditions exercise their 
vocation at places like Kimberley and Johannesburg would be 
first considered Among these are many fullytrained nurses 
fully qualified to do any work to which they might be set 
Their lot is a hard one for prices at Capetown are high and 
civil employment is not easily obtained 
No one here would doubt the readiness with which the 
nurses at home would volunteer for service but they are 
not wanted At some future date the question of the em 
ployment of nurses to a greater extent than now obtains in 
military hospitals may come again to the front and the ex 
perience derived from this campaign will be of much value 
but this sort of question is one that it would be most im 
proper to discuss at present and most unprofitable No sane 
person would seriously argue however strong the views he 
held that any grave change of system should be made during 
a time of stress and trial 
The feeling that animates so many at home is just as strong 
at Capetown Everyone is desirous of giving practical aid of 
being useful in some capacity It is to be feared that a for 
midable amount of thankless work devolves on the officials of 
the medical department in answering the numerous applica 
tions made 
WNo I AND 2 HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG 
The hospitals at Wynberg are very easily accessible from 
Capetown and when strong southeasterly winds blow Wyn 
berg is a much pleasanter place than Capetown It has been 
found necessary to restrict rigidly the granting of passes to 
the hospitals which otherwise would have been inundated 
with visitors many of whom would have gone out of pure 
curiosity It is not easy to convince people that the essential 
business of a hospital is to get the patients well as quickly as 
possible and move them away to make room foir others and 
that anything which interferes in the least degree with this 
end is highly undesirable 
No 3 HOSPITAL AT RONDEBOSCH 
No 3 Hospital charmingly situated at Rondebosch with 
a magnificent view of Table Mountain was opened on 
December 24th for active work some ioo wounde4 and sick 
brought down in the hospital ship Spartan being the first 
occupants The only objection that can be made against the 
site chosen is that it is rather expoeed to wind ihe trees 
that surround the tents are at some distance The sandy soil 
gives but poor hold for tent pegs and if the  Cape Doctor  
blows with great force there may be anxious moments The 
water supply is abundant and good and the Water Company 
has undertaxen to keep the roads watered When the tent 


222 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA Jl 27 1900 
ropes are secured by long iron pegs which are immediately 
to be provided the airiness of the situation will be an advan 
tage and not ananxiety The hospital is about a mile from 
Rondeboseli Station and the road leading to it is a good one 
Still the journey that has to be made from the docks in the 
case of sick and wounded brought by sea from Natal is rather 
a trying one 
TEh WORK DONE IN THE FIELD HOSPITALS 
It speaks volumes for the excellence of the work done in 
the field hospitals that the patients arrive in such excellent 
condition In my next letter I hope to particularise some of 
the cases under treatment and it will then be seen that praise 
of the work done at the front is thoroughly well merited 
Our correspondent informs us that he was leaving Cape 
town for Durban on the day this letter was despatched 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR

FIELD AMBULANCES 
N my last letter I referred to the question of wheeled 
ambulances for use with the cavalry column and in doing so 
said that I believed a spiderbuils vehicle would be more 
adapted for the purpose in South Africa than any twowheeled 
cart could be not excepting even the Irish jauntinf car Since 
writing an illustration of one of these  spiders as used in 
South Africa appeared among the excellent snapshots from 
the field of operations published by South Africa and by the 
kind permission of the Editor of that journal I am able to 
reproduce it here A glance at this vehicle will show how 
Spider cart used for the transport of wounded Frma photograph 
taken in Pietermaritzburg college Grounds bytespecial corre 
spondent of South 4frica with the force in Na 
extremely difficult it would be to capsize it with its wide 
axlesi and light wheels standing well out from the machine 
Any one of these four wheelsj could go almost anywhere with 
out actually capsizing the ambulance Various atrs of 
 rigsare mounted on wheels such as these teone 
shon itha I ttle modification would not be a bad one for 
aFJmbulancwork The centre of the cart could be used either for 
3 men lying down side by side or for 4 or more men sitting in 
front at least 2 more men might be accommodated with the 
driver For rapid movement over a rough country two goodl 
horses would be used in a vehicle of this description 
DRESS FOR SOLDIEBS 
The question of dres s for troops In South Africa is still re 
ceiving the attention of experienced campaigners The volun 
teers recently sent out are it is satisfactory to see provided 
with the wideawake felt hat instead of the helmet but puttees 
continue to be very much in demand and although com 
fortable to the wearer are not entirely suitable for rough work 
in South Africa The spear grass of India or  stick  grass ol 
South Africa are equally liable to get into the puttees and 
cause considerable annoyance while the various thorns abun 
dant in the bush of South Africa will undoubtedly tear and 
penetrate them On the whole there can be little doubt that 
some form of leather legging either as a puttee or an ordinary 
legging should be provided especially for the mounted men  
such leggings are being made for the South African contingent 
of the Imperial Yeomanry The latter has the further advan 
tage of being a protection against snakes which although not 
a great danger cannot nevertheless be entirely ignored One 
officer at least it has been pointed out to me since writing 
my last letter lost his life from the bite of a cobra during the 
Zulu war 
TICKS AND NATAL BOBs8 
The following letter from a lady who is herself an experi 
enced traveller has been received 
When seeing alady friend of mine an experienced traveller off to the 
Cape for the fourth time last week she begged me in the interests of our 
soldiers to ascertain if our medical men and surgeons who were accom 
panying them were aware or had been duly warned as to one of the 
plagues of Natalas bad as some of the plagues of Egyptand for which 
the season was just now approachingnamely the prevalence In the 
grass of myriads of bloodthirsty ticks which attack both man and beast 
indiscriminately She herself having made light of her fathees iljunc tion to keep ovf the graes and going to look at some particular shub found herself covered witit them one day Most of these miniature 
leeches sbe managed to remove safely but one failure resulted in one of 
the dreadful Nata sores from which shie suffered agonies and so speaks 
from experience 
The danger is that in hastily tearing off the loathsome little creature the 
head should be left when a socalled Natal sore resultsan ulcer some 
times deep which if multiplied indeflnitely may probably Invalid many 
of our brave men as can easily be imained 
She told me of a simple local remedysome kind of oil as far as I re 
membermixed with tobacqo ash which if applied at once makes the 
insect as she expressed it  kick out backwards intact of its own accord 
I think that this informationthe remedy which Icould more accurately 
verify if you wishedcannot be too widely known for we surely have 
enough to contend with as it is in this arduous campaign and the root of 
evil at the bottom of many a mysterious sore may thus be discovered and 
removed 
The evil is undoubtedly a real one as I can testify from 
personal experience fortunately however the ticks are most 
abundant and troublesome in the immediate vicinity of the 
sea coast and at altitudes of 3000 or 4000 feet they are much 
less numerous I am not acquainted with the remedy re 
ferred to in this letter but I have personally found carbolie 
oil to be absolutely reliable both as apreventive and as a cure 
I can well recall a night spent in ambush near the Kei river 
in the eastem provinces of the Colony We lay in long 
grass awaiting the arrival of a Kaffir marauding party who 
never appeared but the torture of that night I shall never 
forget We were literally devoured by swarms of these ticks 
which infest the long grass of the coast 
It is curious that with ticks as with other paraites some 
sort of immunity appears to become established in the host 
thus a newcomer suffers much more severely from the tick 
bite than the salted colonist The reason would appear to be 
a double one for while the veteran colonial campaigner suffers 
less from the effects of the bites the tick itself appears to 
prefer fresh blood and these parasites invariably attack in 
greater numbers the newcomers Whether the tick is really 
responsible for the Natal sore referred to is not quite ceraIn 
some medical men maintaining that they are the result of a 
different parasite 
Tnc LAST HOURS OF THE FATALLY WOUNDED 
A very admirable letter on this subject was published the 
other day in the Morning Post by Colonel Wyndham Murray 
MP a soldier of wide experience who has served through 
no less than five campaigns In the majority of instances he 
was on the staff of the commander and his opportunities of 
observation have therefore been ample He has already 
spoken with no uncertain voice in the House of Commons on 


J 27 1900 THE WOUNDED AT NETLEY TMs

223 
the question of offering additional facilities for rifle practice 
among our troops He has seen that for those whose sad lot 
it may be to die in a far country it is a great solace to be 
enabled before death actually occurs to send a last message 
to those best loved on earth and to the recipients a com 
munication of this sort mitigates in a measure the bitterness 
of the blow which they have to sustain 
Colonel Murray says that there are no persons whose 
special duty it is to collect the last words of the wounded in 
battle and that many men die in a state of mental agony 
which would be considerably relieved if they were assured 
that their last words of farewell would be faithfully carried 
to their kith and kin Colonel Murray therefore suggests 
that 
Of the Medical Department with each force a few persons should be care 
fullyv selected for tact and other such qualities who should make this 
their special duty immediately after an engagement and that an officer in 
the hospital of each force should collect and make a careful record of 
every such case transmitting the messages as required so that the matter 
be on an organised footing instead of being carried out in nodoubt the 
kindly but chance manner that must be the case at present 
In reference to this we may at once say in justice to our 
profession that we believe this office is invariably performed 
when the opportunity arises but at the same time it must be 
admitted that the first duties of a medical officer are often 
so urgently of a purely surgical character that he has but 
little time for the performance of a duty which requires both 
delicacy and time Where big armies are engaged as in the 
present campaign Colonel Murrays suggestion appears well 
worthy of attention though possibly the task is one which 
should be shared at least by the chapiains department 
Death of course not infrequently comes suddenly aud 
swiftly on the field of battle but there are many cases where 
life lingers it may be for an hour or even less and in such 
opportunity for this last act does occur 
RAPID RECOVERY OF WOUNDED 
In the last issue of the Polyclinic the journal of the Medical 
Graduates College in London Mr Jonathan Hutchinson 
observes that never before in the history of the world were 
wounded soldiers more rapidly restored to the combatant 
ranks The term  wounded he thinks will soon cease to 
have the fearful significance which it once had and all those 
coming under it will hardly be coUlnted as losses when we 
realise that twothirds will probably be back in the ranks 
within a fortnight Mr Hutchinson concludes his article by 
pointing out what great interest would attach to statistics 
collected by those who have the opportunity as to the precise 
nature of the injuries of those killed on the modern battle 
field Experience of the present campaign would apparently 
show that the only absolubely fatal part is the heart and this 
as has been suggested by more than one writer may eventually 
be protected by a breastplate Even penetrating wounds of 
head although of course usually fatal we have seen in the 
present campaign are not invariably so 
THE WOUNDED AND SICK AT NETLEY 
By OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT 
DURNG the past few weeks detachments of sick and wounded 
from South Africa have been arriving at Netley The empty 
transports returning from the Cape afford ample and luxurious 
accommodation to convey to the military hospitals in Eng 
land a considerable number of men There are now at Netley 
a total of 450 soldiers returned invalided of which number 
358 are surgical cases 
On Thursday January x8th by the kind permission of the 
Principal Medical Officer Colonel Charlton I visited the 
hospital at Netley in order to see some of these men A 
winters su shone brightly over the fine buildings trim 
lawns and playing fields of the hospital From the waters 
edge the jetty ran out into the rippling surface of Southamp 
ton Water and across the water lay the wooded slopes of 
Eampshire covered by the perennial haze of England th 
whole presenting a scene both beautiful and tranquil It was 
a grateful change from the murk and gloom of a winters day 
in London It was the scene that formed the soldiers last 
glimpse of England as he embarked for the South and it was 
this scene which he gladly welcomed again on his return for 
a period of convalescence and rest The excellent accommo 
dation which the empty transports are able to offer together 
with the fine weather voyage from South Africa evidently 
exercised most beneficial effects on the invalids Thus of the 
136 cases recently landed from the Aurania only one bad to be 
carfied into the hospital the others all having sufficiently 
recovered to walk As my time was limited I confined my 
visit to an inspection of some of the extremely interesting 
surgical cases the result of gunshot wounds of these the 
great majority have been inflicted by the Mauser bullet 
SurgeonCaptain Steele of the Militia Medical Staff Corps 
who was orderly officer for the day took me to Major Dick 
RAMC in whose charge most of the surgical cases had 
been placed and who kindly took me round some of the 
wards Among the cases were men who had been pierced by 
bullets in almost every direction Thus there were cases in 
which the head had been wounded and apparently even the 
brain traversed others were shot through the thorax while 
several had been wounded in the abdomen groin and but 
tock and both upper and lower limbs Shoulder and elbow 
joint had in turn been pierced In one or two cases of which 
I give brief notes the body had been traversed literally from 
one end to the other The wounds witb the exception of a 
very few had almost entirely healed and in a large number 
of cases had left no symptom whatever behind them Most 
interesting of those with appreciable aftereffects were 
cases of nerve injury in which a degree of either pain or 
paralysis or both remained 
I will now give a few notes of the cases I actually saw in the 
order in which I saw them 
CAsE IBullet Wound of Humerus 
LanceCorporal W R of the 3rd Grenadier Guards took 
part in the engagement at Belmont He received a bullet 
wound in the arm which fractured the humerus and appa 
rently had involved the shoulderjoint the wound had com 
pletely healed the wound of entrance had healed before 
leaving Capetown that of exit on the voyage homeV When 
hit he was standing close to Lieutenant Fryer The 
Grenadiers R says were advanced out of their camp at 
130 AM and subsequently took part in the successful en 
gagement at Belmont the first of Lord Methuens brilliant 
series of actions previous to Magersfontein 
CASE iiBullet Wound of both Thighs without Fracture 
Probable Injury of iatic Nerve 
Private E of the Argyll and Sutherlandshire Highlanders 
was wounded at Modder River by a Mauser bullet which 
traversed both thighs passing posterior to and clearing the 
femur in both legs The second bullet had traversed the left 
deltoid muscle The wounds had all healed but a good deal 
of pain was still felt in the right foot The patient himself 
attributed this pain to rheumatism acquired from exposure 
subsequent to the wound as he lay inl pelting rain for many 
hours There can however I should imagine be little 
doubt that in this case the sciatic nerve had been lacerated 
by the passage of the bullet and that the pain referred to 
was due to this 
CASE iiiBullet Wound of Elbowjoint 
Private K of the same regiment had received a wound in 
the elbow which had fractured the bones of the joint The 
wound had been entirely healed for some time past and the 
splints had recently been removed There was still a good 
deal of thickening but the patient was making excellent pro 
gress 
CASE ivPerforating Bullet Wound of Thorax Paraple k 
Private K of the Kings Own or s ire Light Infantry 
was engaged at Grasspan in his case the bullet traversed the 
thorax It had entered below the tenth rib on the left side in 
the midaxillary line crossed in front of the spinal column 
which presumably it had grazed and came out in the mid 
axillary region on the right side below the seventh rib The 
shot was from a rifle at 6oo yards distance and made a per 
fectly clean wound both of entrance and exit Major 
Dick in commenting upon this case said that the cleanest 
wounds were those from a Mauser bullet fired at from 4oo to 
xooo yards below 4oo and over iooo a more explosive effect 
is produced The patient explained that after the wound the 
effect he was principallyconscious of was a loss of power in 


224 
MA JovMALJ THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA  
JAN 27 1900 
both legs Power had gradually been returning and with it a 
certain amount of pain the pain had increased slightly as 
the power returned As this patient was one of those cases 
requiring a recumbent position during the whole of his 
journey I fasked him how he had fared He said that the 
journey had been comfortable from start to finish first of all 
by train to Oapetown and then by ocean steamer to good 
quarters at Netley He felt that he had been well treated and 
cared for and that every provision practicable had been made 
for his comfort 
CASE vPerforating Bullet Wound of Che8t Pleural 
Effsion 
Private W of the Grenadier Guards was wounded at Bel 
mont The bullet had entered 2 inches to the left of the 
nipple of the left side where a rib had been fractured The 
bullet came out to the immediate left of the spine below the 
seventh rib Three weeks afterwards a certain amount of 
fluid had apparently collected in the pleura and had been 
drawn off through a trocar All the wounds had healed and 
he was rapidly regaining his normal condition The wounds 
of entrance and exit as well as the site of the puncture of the 
trocar were all visible The patient stated that the fluid 
drawn off consisted of blood and water There was at any 
rate no reason to suppose that an empyema had formed 
CASE vIBullet Wound of Arm Paralysis of Extensor8 
LanceCorporal R of the ist Kings Royal Rifles was 
wounded at Lombards Kop near Ladysmith In his case 
the bullet had traversed the back of the right arm and pre 
sumably had severed the musculospiral nerve The wound 
had healed completely but there was entire loss of power in 
the extensor muscles R had taken part in the march of 
General Yule from Dundee to Ladysmith and two days 
afterwards was engaged at Lombards Kop where he received 
his wound 
CAsE vr Wound of Face Fracture of Nasal Bones 
Private E K of the ist Battalion Scots Guards took part 
in the storming of the Kop at Belmont He had received a 
bullet in the face fracturing the nasal bones and destroying 
the right eye He was not unconscious after the injury and 
said that he had not suffered any great degree of pain 
CASE viIIBullet Wound of lschium 
Private E of the 2nd Kings Royal Rifles was engaged at 
Lombards IRop on October 30th He had a wound of entrance 
over the ischium and the bullet had remained lodged in the 
body It is hoped that it will be definitely located with the 
aid of Roentgen rays at present the wound has completely 
healed and all that he is suffering from is a certain amount of 
pain in the right knee and groin 
CASE IxShell Wound of Muslekoof Forearm 
The next case was one of a wound from a shell Of these some 
6 or 8 had been received at Netley Private J S of the 3rd 
Grenadier Guardswas engaged at Modder River where he re 
ceived his wound A fragment of shell had torn out a portion 
of the muscles of the forearm the wound had healed but 
there was a good deal of contraction of the flexors 
CAsE xBullet Wound of Foot Cellulitis 
Private H of the 2nd West Yorkshire Regiment formed 
one of the few exceptions to the general rule and had a bullet 
wound of the foot still unhealed In this case sloughing and 
cellulitis had occurred and on admission to the hospital his 
temperature was still elevated Since his stay at Netley his 
temperature has gone down to normal the wound is in a per 
fectly healthy condition and doing well 
CAsE xMPerforating Bullet Wound of Cranium 
This was a very interesting and astonishing case of a man 
who had a bullet pass through his head behind both orbits I 
was unfortunately unable to see him as he was taking a 
walk somewhere in the extensive grounds Major Dick 
assured me that the man was practically well that he had 
never shown any special symptoms He is probably the same 
case as that referred to in the letter of the Capetown corre 
spondent of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL published some 
few weeks ago 
CAsE xiiBullet Wound of Pelvis and Abdomen Injury to 
Bladder 
Private B No io Mountain Battery was shot in the right 
buttock during the engagement at 1teitiontein near Lady 
smith while serving his gun The bullet entered about 
2 inches to the right of the anus and came out slightly below 
the umbilicus and within 3 inches of it to the left He passed 
blood in his urine for some six days and then steadily re 
covered The bullet he believes was a ricochet off a stone 
close by If this was so the wound was unusually clean for 
as a rule a bullet which ricochets from a rock is rendered 
jagged and dangerous But both the wound of entrance and 
that of exit in this as in all the other cases simply showed 
after healing up small purple marks about thesize of the top 
of the little finger 
CASE mixPerjorating Bulet Wound of Neck and Thorax 
Private L of the 2nd Coldstream Guards took part in the 
fight at Magersfontein The bullet entered on the left side 
of the neck low down and came out below the tenth rib do 
the right side of the midaxillary line What course this 
bullet could have taken without wounding one of the larger 
vessels is difficult to conceive 
CAsE xIVPerforating Bullet Wound of Thorax Abdomen anct 
Pelvis 
Private M of the Argyll and Sutherlandshire Highlanders 
took part in the fight at Magersfontein The bullet entered 
on the left side below and in front of the outer end of the 
clavicle and it came out an inch below the crest of the right 
ileum In this instance the bullet must have traversed the 
thorax the abdomen pelvis and finally the iliac bone 
literally from one end of the body to the other The patient 
said that he had a good deal of abdominal pain for the fSt six 
days but after that he was soon all right again Both wounds 
had completely healed and the wound of exit was very little 
though slightly larger than that of entrance 
Time would not allow of a further inspection of cases 
although a large number would have repaid careful examin 
ation If some of the surgical lecturers at the Polyclinic could 
get a dozen or two of these casesnow practically convales 
centto come to London for their demonstrations they would 
certainly be conferring a favour upon a large number of the 
profession who would be delighted to have an opportunity of 
seeing some of the extraordinary results of the Mauser bullet 
wounds The patients now at Netley are in good hands and 
should do well In addition to the officers of the RAMC 
several of the militia medical staff corps have been callea 
up for service and 8urgeonCaptain Steele informed me that 
from his own corps he had taken a company of 5o men who 
were assisting in variouscapacities about the hospital 
HOSPITALS FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
THE YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
THE organisation of this hospital has made satisfactory pro 
gress and it will probably be ready to leave on February 3rd 
should transport be at that time available This matter 
which is in the hands of the Transport Department of the

in one of the huts Special attention is being given to all the 
sanitary arrangements and a PasteurChamberland installation 
to supply filtered water for seven hundred and fifty persons will 
be provided A WashingtonLyons steriliser for infected 
clothing and an incinerator for dressings will be taken out 
It has been resolved to increase the staff of nurses to forty all 
fully trained and carefully selected The superintendent of 
nurses will be Miss Fisher who was trained at Guys hospital 
and the night superintendent will be Miss Brereton lately 
a sister of the Bright Ward at Guys Hospital The

member of the Order of St John felt assured would maintain 
the grand traditions of the Knights Hospitallers of old who 
went to the East to succour the sick and wounded in war as 
they the English modern representatives would surely do in 
the South in friendly emulation of their comrades in the 
Royal Army Medical Corps whose motto In arduis fidelis 
faithful in difficulties had from all accounts been well 
adhered to in spite of the asperities which stimulate rather 
than deter The SurgeonGeneral concluded by wishing them 
every success and a safe return after a successful campaign

THE LATE MR JOHN RUSKIN 
MR RUSKINS ILLNESS DESCRIBED BY HIMSELF 
WTHEN some time ago I was on a visit to Mr Ruskin at his 
house at Coniston he received me with that genial 
almost tender kindness and hospitality for which he made 
Brantwood famous and not only Brantwood but any other 
house which for the time being had been his home He 
talked in his cbarmingly frank and naive manner which 
considering the delicacy of some of the subjects upon which 
he touched was at once delightful and even to a friend 
a little surprising Ruskinas everyone knowswas an 
admirable talker A rich vein of playful humour when 
he was not in too serious and earnest a mood underlaid 
his conversation which when accompanied with the merry 
twinkle of his deep blue eyes and the smile that on such 
occasions was ever playing prettily about his mouth and 
lighting up his expression possessed a fascination peculiarly 
his own One morning as we sat at the breakfasttable 
Mr Ruskin and Iand after he had served me standing 
as with a pretty oldfashioned courtesy he insisted upon 
doingthe sudden crowing of a bantam cook just outside 
the window behind methat overlooking the lakecaused me 
to turn my head quickly that way 
Do you object to that noise inquired my host with 
some solicitude  Somne people do Now I like the sound 
of poultry very much in moderation but it always serves 
to bring me back to a very painful incident which I will tell 
you about It may be of some psychological interest one of 
these days 
 During my first illness of wild deliriumfor I have had 
several such attacks but the first was by far the worstthe 
voice of the fowls was an inexpressible terror to me Ridi 
culous as it may seem my madness took the form of my ever 
being in conflict more or less personal with the Evil One 
I had at that time an old peacock who was good for nothing 
and bad for very much for at that season of the year the 
weather was abominable and he was for ever foretelling rain 
with his ugly croaking voice I was lying ill upstairs and so 
quickly flew my thoughts I have since in my subsequent 
attacks which were much less severe been able to verify this 
extraordinary psychological fact which proves how the 
Creator of all can subdivide time infinitesimally that every 
time he croaked 1 thought I was inma farmyard and that I was 
impelled by the tyrant Devil to do some fearful wrong which 
I strove with all my might and main to rr sist Bat my pas
