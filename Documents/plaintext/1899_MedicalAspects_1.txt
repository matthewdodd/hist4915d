THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR 
By a South African Campaigner 
I 
The Medical Work of the Campaign 
It is now abundantly clear that during the South African 
campaign the medical service both in the army and civil 
branches will have important duties to perform Hospital 
ships and a hospital train will shortly be despatched in addi 
tion to the resources already available  and although we may 
still hope that the campaign will be a short one and the 
deplorable losses of life on both sides be soon brought to an 
end it is evident from the very imperfect medical resources 
at the disposal of the Boers that our medical and ambulance 
departments will have while the war lasts to devote a con 
siderable portion of their attention to Boer wounded in addi 
tion to attending to our own soldiers 
The Mauser and Lee MetfordBullets 
Judging from the result of the campaign up to the present 
and from the nature of the wounds received by our soldiers it 
is probable that the great bulk of surgical cases will con 
sist of bullet wounds and inasmuch as the Mauser 
bullet ued by the Boers is a small hard conical one 
which passes out with as little disturbance to sur 
rounding tissues as is produced at the point of entrance 
these cases should in the great majority of instances do well 
wherever the wound is merely one of a limb or limbs  and 
although thoracic and abdominal wounds will naturally be 
more serious their gravity is certainly less than it would be 
with a MartiniHenry or old Snider bullet The large pro 
portion of wounded to killed and the excellent accounts re 
ceived of the progress of the wounded are both largely due to 
this peculiarity in the Mauser bullet 
In the same way we know from past experience and also 
from recent Boer testimony that the LeeMet fordour own 
rifleinflicts a similarly small and clean wound The Lee 
Metford bullet it is true is somewhat larger than the Mauser 
but the difference is slight and both bullets when compared 
with the MartiniHenry are diminutive Of the wounds in 
flicted by the MartiniHenry I have myself had practical 
experience there was with this bullet little difficulty in 
telling the wound of entrance and the wound of exit the 
characteristic features of which are so fully described in the 
old textbooks The track of the wound itself also was large 
and well defined and the shock wherever the wound might 
be was severe This was the rifle used by the Boers in the 
campaign of 1881 and the proportion of killed to wounded 
then was very much higher than it is today 
Shell Wounds  Melinite and Lyddite 
Fortunately for us and for our soldiers the Boer shell from 
some peculiarity in its loading or structure very frequently 
omits to burst so that hitherto the losses from artillery fire 
on our side have not been very numerous although it is 
equally clear that our own artillery have inflicted very serious 
losses upon the Boers The wounds from bursting shells may 
be of any degree of severity but obviously cannot be of so 
clean a character as those produced by Mauser bullets In 
view of the protests recently made by the Boer General 
against our use of lyddite I took the opportunity the other 
day to obtain the opinion of an artillery officer and a naval 
commander on the subject I found they had been freely 
comparing notes and discussing the question The follow 
ing is a summary of the information derived from those 
authorities Melinite and lyddite although not absolutely 
identical are so for all practical purposes and the former is 
largely used in Continental armies The shells now being 
used by the Boers in their field guns are I was assured by 
the Royal Artillery officer loaded with melinite If accurately 
fired these shells would if they exploded inflict very severe 
losses upon our men but by a fortunate coincidence these 
shells although not infrequently directed with accuracy by 
the German artillerists now serving with the Boers do not as 
a rule burst 
The shells used in our field artillery are loaded with black 
powder and shrapnel and never fail to explode The only 
lyddite shells used by us were fired from the naval guns for 
the first time at Farquhars Farm on October 30th They are 
of somewhat large size and doubtless did great execution as 
they called forth General Jouberts protest In sending this 
protest however the Boer General did not we understand 
send any guarantee that the Boer melinite was intentionally 
I kept damp or otherwise inefficient The difference between 
i a blackpowder and a lyddite shell is that fragments of the 
former must strike a foe in order to inflict injury whereas 
mere vicinity to the explosion of the latter is fatal from the 
terrific concussion which is produced In this respect it 
seems to be similar to dynamite Men or animals killed by 
the explosion of lyddite have been found in some cases to 
show no wound whatever 
The Summer Heats 
Another factor to be reckoned with by the medical service 
in the present campaign is that the summer is rapidly coming 
on in South Africa and by December the heat on the plains 
of the Karoo and Orange Free State will be very great A 
temperature of 90o or even higher in the shade may have to 
be encountered and in the sun the heat at midday will pro 
duce many cases of solar fever and sunstroke unless provision 
is made against it The hospital train should have more than 
the ordinary protection overhead and the fittings might well 
be made to approach more to those in use in India than in 
South Africa 
The Transvaal and the Free State at least those portions of 
them which Sir Redvers Bullers column will enter are situ 
ated on the high veld of South Africa and one peculiarity of 
these high inland plateaux is the great changes between the 
night and 
day temperatures which have to be borne in mind 
by troops bivouacking on the veld Sharp attacks of 
diarrhoea and dysentery are very liable to occur at this time 
of the year 
The Climate of the Inland Plateaux 
Johannesburg is 5600 feet high and at this altitude the 
temperature seldom goes above 85o F in the shade Pretoria 
lies under the Magaliesbergen at an altitude of 4500 feet and 
is considerably hotter than Johannesburg The great interior 
plateaux on which both Bloemfontein and Pretoria stand are 
those plains lying inside the semicircle of mountains which 
run all round South Africa parallel to the coast and amongst 
which in Natal itself our troops are now more or less en 
tangled 
The Thunderstorms 
The thunderstorms in these plains are sometimes terrific 
and although grateful in their aftereffects are trying at the 
time especially to men clad in khaki Wet khaki is about 
as unpleasant and while it remains wet as unhealthy as any 
thing I know Chills and occasionally pneumonia will occur 
among men exposed to wet 
Froudes description of one of these thunderstorms on the 
high veld of the Transvaal during the summer is so graphic 
and true that I will quote it as showing the dangers to 
health as well also unfortunately to transport which a series 
of these storms may produce The extract is taken from his 
South African Diary  
The lightning was rose colour deepening at times to 
crimson Each flash appeared like a cross  a vertical line 
seemed to strike the earth a second time crossing it horizont 
ally The air was a blaze of fire the rain fell in such a 
deluge that the plain in a few minutes was like a lake Of 
course we could not move the horses stood shivering up 
to their fetlocks in water At one time there was no interval 
between the flash and the report so that we were in the very 
centre of the storm The sense of utter helplessness prevented 
me from being nervous  I sat still and looked at it in mere 
amazement In two hours it was over the sky cleared 
almost suddenly and with the dripping landscape shining in 
the light of a summer sunset we trotted on to the river 
In such hours as these on the High Veld the sound of 
Heavens artillery will drown even the roar of battle 
The first scientific meeting of the Zoological Society of 
London for the session 18991900 was held at the Societys 
House 3 Hanover Square on Tuesday last November 14th 
when Mr F Vaughan Kirby read Field Notes on the Blue 
buck of Cape Colony Papers were also read by Mr R I 
Pocock and Mr Stanley S Flower
