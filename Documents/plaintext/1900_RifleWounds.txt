The law by which the employment of unqualified assistants 
has been made illegal has naturally raised the demand for 
qualified medical men and the numerous openings official 
and otherwise in the Colonies have further drained the supply 
The introduction of the five years curriculum with the con 
sequent increase in the expense of education must also influ 
ence the rate of income required to attract good candidates 
This is not a point on which I can speak with authority but 
it is well worthy of consideration 
In conclusion I consider the chief points necessary to place 
the RAMC on a proper footing and secure a good class of 
candidates are  i Increase of pay at home and in the colonies 
2 The pay in India to be brought up to the level of combatant 
officers at least 3 The strength of the RAMC to be in 
creased to at least 1000 executive officers with the formation of 
an adequate reserve 4 The reappointment of medical officers 
to militia re iments 5 The extension of military titles to 
militia and volunteer medical officers 6 A guarantee of a 
fair amount of leave for study and also for recreation 7 Sur 
geongenerals should be granted the title of majorgeneral and 
be graded with the rest of the general officers of the army 
8 The proper recognition of majorgenerals and colonels on 
the staff of the army and on the staff of the general officers 
commanding districts 9 A more equable distribution of 
honours and rewards 
SurgeonGeneral ODwyer PMO Aldershot advocated the 
desirability of the PMO on active service being on the staff 
of the General Commandingin Chief in order that he might be 
enabled to administer his department under the most 
favourable circumstances He also advocated that this PMO 
should have executive powers re sanitary matters and 
instanced many advantages which would result if it were so  
he remarked that there were not many Generals who now 
sanctioned this 
SurgeonMajor Caverhill MB Lothians and Berwickshire 
Yeomanry considered that the authorities would have great 
difficulty in getting suitable candidates for the RAMC in the 
future First there were fewer entrants to the medical profes 
sion owing to the greater expense attending the extended cur 
riculum of five years study  and secondly the increased num 
ber of appointments in civil life caused by the abolition of the 
unqualified assistant conducting branch practices The 
RAMC was undermanned even in peace time  in an 
emergency their places could not be efficiently filled by undisci 
plined civil practitioners The deficiency of medical officers 
was the cause of great dissatisfaction as regards leave with its 
opportunities for study and keeping abreast of recent advances 
in medical science In the German army completely 
equipped bacteriological laboratories accompanied each army 
corps They were also to be found in the Russian army both in 
the medical and veterinary departments These were not pro 
vided for in our regulations The time had now come for the 
formation of a special sanitary organisation evolved from the 
ranks of the RAMC This body could be reinforced if need 
be by men of special training and great practical experience 
such as our county medical officers These medical officers of 
health as inspecting officers or as consultants would be of 
equal if not greater importance to the wellbeing of the 
army than the consulting surgeons appointed in the recent 
campaign 
SurgeonCaptain Harper MD VMSC said that in 
consequence of the drain of medical officers of the RAMC 
to South Africa many civilian practitioners had been called 
in to assist or take charge of military hospitals or troops at 
home A most important matter for consideration in this 
connection was the Volunteer Bill at present before the 
House of Commons which by substituting the words 
 
sud 
den emergency for the words actual or apprehended 
invasion altered the whole position of the volunteer force 
Sudden emergency was far too elastic a term and 
practically meant nothing Sir Howard Vincents statement 
i the House that the volunteers on the whole were in favour 
of the change was so far as he could gather quite incorrect 
It was impossible that any large proportion of officers or men 
with families depending on them for support could remain in 
a force under the proposed new conditions If the Bill became 
law it would be followed by a very large number of resigna 
tions and those of many of the best and keenest officers and 
men The matter was one of vital importance both to the 
medical and combatant branches of the volunteer force 
SurgeonGeneral Hamilton in reply said that the position 
of PMOs on lines of communication was all wrong They 
ought to be with the general in command and under his 
instructions should issue orders to the subordinate PMOs 
In the same way PMOs should be on the immediate staff of 
the GOC and under his instructions correspond 
 
by order 
The future supply of candidates was a most important question 
which must be gone into by the British Medical Association 
Volunteer medical officers would be in a very difficult position 
under the new Act if passed and men could not be expected 
to give up their practices to go off on a small salary to distant 
military stations 
MODERN SMALLBORE RIFLE WOUNDS 
By Clinton Dent FRCS 
Surgeon and Joint Lecturer on Surgery St Georges Hospital London 
So much has been written during the past few months on the 
subject of smallbore rifle woundsthat it is well nigh impossible 
to break new ground The surgeons who have been working 
in this campaign seem on the whole to be fairly well agreed as 
to the general lines for practice It may not be unprofitable if 
I endeavour to summarise some of the conclusions on surgical 
points so far as they appear to be justified by the evidence 
already collected This campaign has given us valuable ex 
perience of the effects of smallbore bullets travelling at high 
velocities Between the Mauser and the LeeMetford rifle 
there does not appear to me to be really anything to choose if 
we regard solely the destructive effects of the weapon There 
can be little doubt I think that our service rifle has shown 
itself to be a thoroughly good weapon and one that deteriorates 
very slowly from hard work My experience was almost 
wholly derived from wounds inflicted by the Mauser 
bullet but the same views really must hold good for 
both weapons One difference perhaps of importance in 
the LeeMetford and Mauser bullet is the steel sheath 
of the latter which breaks up worse It may still be a 
question for military experts to determine whether the 
smallbore rifle as at present adopted is suitable for every 
sort of warfare It is pretty clear that for the South African 
campaign it was eminently fitted and has proved altogether a 
success At the same time I believe that the tendency in the 
future will not be in the direction of further diminution of 
bore increase in rapidity of twist and diminution of weight 
of bullet thereby securing higher velocity and longer range 
Already it would seem that the range of modern rifles is 
longer than is really absolutely necessary Efforts will be made 
no doubt to increase the flatness of trajectory and the 
frequency of short range wounds will increase Much has 
been said as to the importance of the stopping action of bullets 
and it is asserted that the small high velocity bullet does not 
compare favourably with the older weapon in this respect For 
civilised warfare however the stopping action is certainly quite 
adequate and as warfare with savage tribes is likely to become 
less frequent andas moreover commercial enterprisetends to 
provide belligerents in every part of the globe with modem 
weapons longrange warfare is likely to become more and 
more the rule For some time to come therefore bullet 
woundsand these still constitute the huge majority of 
wounds received in warfareare likely to be of the class that 
we have had to deal with in the Boer war Broadly speaking 
in the South African campaign bullet wounds of all kinds 
have done well Recoveries from very severe wounds have 
been numerous and many of these recoveries have been most 
 remarkable The percentage of wounded men who have been 
 
fit to return to duty has been unusually high Wounds 
causing permanent disability are less frequent than was 
formerly the case Injuries of the limbs necessitating ampu 
tation are it will be found fewer proportionately than in any 
previous war Conservative surgery hasand most properly 
been carried further and with highly successful results than 
I in former campaigns These satisfactory results have been as 
I cribed mainly to the socalled humanity of the modern smallbor e 
bullets and it would seem to follow from this that from the 
military point of view the modern weapons do not fulfil the 
 prime conditions of warfare If the victory is to rest with the

side that can most quickly kill or efficiently disable a I 
large number of its adversaries then wars are likely to be 
prolonged and the humanity of the bullet would prove to be 
but a curse in disguise I think the socalled humanity of a 
smallbore bullet a great deal exaggerated There are other 
conditions to be reckoned with In the South African campaign 
I believe that the surgical healthiness of the climate and the 
wide adoption of the openair method of treatment have had 
quite as great a share in bringing about the favourable statistics 
as the character of the weapons employed The idea is far too 
prevalent that the injury inflicted by a smallbore bullet is 
almost trifling whatever part be hit It is largely a question 
of whether the wound becomes septic or not and septic com 
plications attacking either bullet or operation wounds have 
been very rare Indeed in South Africa operation wounds of 
all kinds have done exceptionally well This possibly may be 
ascribed to the efficiency with which the antiseptic system 
has been carried out in military surgery But truly aseptic 
surgery is practically impossible under the conditions of 
active service It is a matter of the faithful observance of elabo 
rate detail by all and they are many concerned in the opera 
tion Surgeons have to do the best they can in base as well 
as field hospitals and they have to work with orderlies  a hard 
working and highly septic body of men The want of dressers 
in a military hospital is to my mind more felt than in a civil 
hospital Certain views that have recently obtained with 
regard to bullet wounds have now I think been finally 
exploded but these cherished traditions die rather hard and 
one still sees reference to them One of these is that the 
heating of the bullet sears the track of the wound and so 
destroys any germs that might lodge favouring thus the 
immediate union and preventing any septic complications 
The ballets as a matter of fact fired from modern 
mallbore rifles are in the first place usually sterile for 
they have a hard smooth surface and in the next 
place they are not heated  but even if white hot the time 
that they occupy in passing through the 
body 
is so extremely 
short that no cauterising action could possibly be exerted 
The arrest of movement might heat the bullet but a bullet 
that can travel a couple of miles and hit hard at the end of it 
does not have much movement arrested and thereby con 
verted into heat A bullet making a flesh wound 6 or 8 inches 
long occupies at a range of 800 to 1000 yards somewhere 
about tcVq of a second A bullet that strikes a bone and 
lodges has its forward movement and its rotation arrested 
but no cauterising action is found in the neighbourhood of 
such and the energy is really dissipated in other directions 
of which the effect is very manifest  and this brings me to 
another theory that is now I think pretty generally dis 
carded  the socalled hydrodynamic or hydraulic theory has 
been held to explain the extending or explosive effects of rifle 
bullets on animal tissues Those who believe in this theory 
look upon a limb as a closed vessel containing fluid and 
account for the destruction which is undoubtedly seen some 
times at short range as due to the enormous increase of pres 
sure caused by the ingress of the bullet on the incompressible 
contents of the part hit This theory though abandoned for 
the most part with regard to the greater part of the body is 
till considered by some to hold good for penetrating wounds 
of the skull Experiments however do not bear out the 
hydraulic view and the explosive or expanding effects 
are now held to be due to the energy of the bullet 
which radiates out in lines from the long axis of the 
bullet track The hydraulic theory is now almost as 
wholly discarded as the projectile air theory This 
imagines that a cushion of highly compressed air is carried in 
in front of the bullet and exercises the explosive effect This 
is an old theory which has been recently revi ved Itmaybeheard 
of again but it is hardly worth while at present to administer 
the coup de grce to what is already defunct So again wind 
contusions from large projectiles are no longer believed in 
They disappeared when round shot ceased to be used For 
round shot would strike a part and inflict the most grievous 
injury on the deeper tissues though as they glanced off the 
skin might show no mark whatever 
As instances of cases in which military surgery is now much 
more conservative may be cited penetrating abdominal 
wounds compound fractures wounds of joint and nerve in 
juries There is a general consensus of agreement that the 
great bulk of penetrating abdominal wounds are best left 
alone The hopes that recent advance in abdominal surgery 
might lead to great improvement in the treatment of these 
serious injuries has been altogether falsified Patients 
operated on generally speaking do not do well or in other 
words the majority die It is impossible to make a thorough 
examination of the viscera and to ensure that every wound of 
the intestineand the wounds may be very numerous indeed 
from a single shotis dealt with without inflicting the most 
grievous damage on the abdominal contents Adhesions 
which form with great rapidity are likely to be broken down 
haemorrhage set up and extravasation of the in 
testinal contents brought about by manipulation On 
the other hand a remarkable number of cases in which the 
intestines have been undoubtedly perforated perhaps in 
many places have recovered The patients can seldom if ever 
be operated on early enough or get the lengthy and un 
divided attention that their condition would require in the 
field hospitals  and even if they could secure this their 
chances of recovery would probably be little increased A 
large proportion of cases of wound of the large intestines do 
well Patients with these injuries have their best chance if 
they have been long fasting and if they abstain for a long 
time after from any sort of drink  even a glass of water if 
given too early may bring about a fatal result in a man who 
might otherwise recover The shock of smallbore bullets in 
abdominal wounds is very much less than might be expected  
indeed former views as to shock from all kinds of bullet 
wounds must now be greatly modified The ingenious view 
has been put forward that the wound of the intestine pro 
duces a sort of tetanus of the gut and that the arrest of the 
peristaltic action allows time for lymph to be exuded while 
the slits in the intestine are sealed up Wounds of joints 
perhaps show the most remarkable contrast of any class of 
injuries compared with former experience Very few cases 
have gone wrong where the kneejoint has been wounded 
by bullets and I can recall a number of cases of wounds of 
joints such as the elbow which have done perfectly well 
without any complication or operation Primary excisions 
have been excessively rare Formerly it was considered 
highly conservative surgery to save the limb by operating on 
the joint now the joint can be left alone Wounds of the 
anklejoint have on the whole done worse than any others 
Of nerve injuries which are very common indeed it need 
only be said here that the expectant treatment has proved 
the best Many cases were operated on at the outset in 
which it was imagined that the nerve had been wholly or 
partially divided in which it was found that the trunk was 
quite intact and that the bullet track had only been near it 
While the extent of recovery in these cases is very great it 
is seldom in my experience altogether complete but the main 
point is that it is not likely to be rendered more complete by 
operation even when a mechanical lesion that can be dealt 
with is found 
SurgeonGeneral ODwyer wanted to know how the more 
frequent nerve injuries with the smallbore bullet when con 
tracted with those caused by larger bullets could be explained 
In wounds through the lungs even though the patient might 
be fit to resume his duties he always when questioned com 
plained of a little shortness of breath Why if the South 
African climate was eo effective in healing wounds was not 
civil surgery more successful there  He thought the prompt 
use of the first field dressing and instructing men how to do 
so had had much to do with the success mentioned He was 
glad to know that it was now an established fact that abdominal 
wounds from smallbore bullets had better be left alone 
What was the proportion of wounds from field guns  
 
Septic 
orderlies 
 
on field service were difficult to avoid 
SurgeonGeneral Hamilton said that fiat trajectory was 
what the military authorities aimed at and that it was a 
convertible term with velocity The great object of course 
was that any mistake in judging distance was remedied by 
the flatness of the trajectory He assisted Mr John Rigby 
years ago in experiments with express bullets and they 
found that bullets propelled by small charges penetrated 
into sawdust much further than when fired with large 
charges This was of course caused by the bullet not 
setting up or mushrooming as it did when fired with

heavy charges The larger the bullet the greater the shock 
and when shooting big game in India he found that a 
spherical bullet from a smooth bore stopped the charge of a 
tiger or a bear better than smaller bore express bullets The 
smaller the bullet the less the shock and in this way the 
modern bullet was more merciful 
Mr Clinton Dent in reply said he knew many cases of 
joint wounds in which this field dressing was not employed 
for many hours  one especially a wound of the kneejoint and 
j 
popliteal artery which made an excellent recovery He con 
sidered it was now proved that nerves and tendons might be 
pushed aside by smallbore bullets but thought the high 
velocity accounted for some nerve injuries the nerve not being 
visibly injured He considered the South African climate 
more favourable for wound treatment than that of this 
country According to Mr Cecil Rhodes artillery fire 
demoralised  
 
it gets on your nerves though it may not kill 
much The effect of artillery fire at Paardeberg was 
lessened by Lord Robertss humanity the fire being directed 
mainly on the commissariat  at Magersfontein the trenches 
indicated great effects from shrapnel He was satisfied that 
the expectant treatment in abdominal wounds from small 
bore bullets was best 
SurgeonGeneral Henry Skey Muir CB MD War 
Office mentioned a case of a smallbore bullet in South Africa 
striking the cervical spine and carrying away two teeth in its 
exit the patient now being in fair health 
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ON BOARD SHIP 
By W J Colborne 
StaffSurgeon RN 
The ships of Her Majestys Navy are now such complicated 
engines of war and so filled with machinery that the space 
that can be allotted to the sick is necessarily limited but 
although limited it is sufficient for all the ordinary ailments 
and diseases met with  yet provision cannot be made for 
isolation and observation wards and so it behoves the medical 
officer to take such measures as he can to prevent the onset of 
infectious diseases and when they do arise to combat them 
with the means at his disposal so as to limit their spread and 
to safeguard the health of the patient and that of the ships 
company 
Our ships now carry many men  they visit ports in all parts 
of the world  a large amount of leave is given to visit the 
shore  and the crew consists of young men  and therefore the 
possibility of infectious disease being contracted is very con 
siderable Retnembering all this one of the first duties of 
the medical officer on visiting a port is to make inquiries from 
the port authorities as to the prevalence or absence of infec 
tious disease its extent and the district affected and should 
it be necessary report the same to the proper authorities of 
the ship so that they may take the necessary steps to either 
warn the men from visiting a particular district or restrict the 
leave Circumstances alone can be a guide as to the necessity 
of curtailing the leave and the length of time the ship 
remains in the port 
The medical officer will also have to pay attention to the 
people who are allowed on board the shipparticularly washer 
women bumboatmen etc Knowing of the existence of 
infectious disease on shore particular attention must be paid 
to all minor ailments that may occur amongst the men and 
endeavour should be made to detect the premonitory sym 
ptoms and on the slightest doubt arising the patient should 
be immediately isolated from his fellows for as long as neces 
sary and carefully watched  a careful watch must also be 
kept on those who are his more immediate neighbours both at 
mess and at night To isolate the patient is not always an 
easy matter on fcoard ship and diligent search will have to be 
made for a spare cabin small watertight compartment or such 
other suitable place and if none are to be found below decks 
a suitable structure of canvas if the weather will permit will 
have to be built on the upper deck 
Should the case develop into one of an infectious nature 
steps must be taken to isolate the patient and his nurse or 
attendant at once  and having obtained a spare cabin or com 
partment it should be prepared for their reception by re 
moving all movable articles swinging service cots and bed 
ding as well as utensils taken to the place and the ventila 
tion attended to particular care being taken that the venti 
lating trunk opens direct on the upper deck so as to avoid the 
possibility of the infection being carried to other parts of the 
ship by means of these trunks  if necessary the ventilation 
openings in this compartment should be closed and sealed 
The patient and attendant should be kept strictly to this com 
partment and neither of them allowed to leave it till oppor 
tunity occurs to send the patient to hospital Should no 
cabin or compartment be available and it be impossible ta 
erect a temporary place on deck part of the sick bay must be 
screened off and this can be done by making a canvas screen 
which can be so fitted by the carpenters with battens so as ta 
reach from the beams above and to the deck beneath and 
effectually cut off this part of the sick bay and be used for the 
isolation of both patient and nurse During the treatment of 
the case the screen should be kept moist or damp by spraying 
or other means with perchloride of mercury solution i in 1000 
and the deck frequently washed with the same The food should 
be placed outside and taken thence by the nurse and all 
excreta mixed with disinfectants before removal The 
medical officer in attendance should wear a linen overall on 
visiting his patient and be particular as to the disinfection of 
his hands and face etc and should go straight from the 
patient on deck and remain there some time before mix 
ing with his messmates and others On the opportunity 
occurring for the patient to be sent to hospital the patients 
bed and bedding as well as the attendant and his clothes 
should be sent and the boat washed with perchloride of mer 
cury solution 1 in 1000 afterwards The attendant can be 
left to nurse the patient or can be disinfected and kept under 
observation for a short period  the men who have carried the 
patient to hospital should also be disinfected The bed bed 
ding and clothing must be disinfected by moist heat in a 
disinfector before being received on board again The place 
occupied by the patient on board the ship should now be dis 
infected The compartment should be sealed the screen 
made wet with perchloride of mercury solution and sulphur 
burnt not less than 3lbs of sulphur to each 1000 cubic feet 
of space being used The compartment and its contents 
should then be thoroughly scrubbed with perchloride solution 
1 in iooo the screen taken down and soaked for twentyfour 
hours in perchloride solution and then scrubbed and hung in 
the air the wooden battens burnt and the paint work should 
be repainted or limewashed 
During the presence of infectious disease on board ship all 
men should be warned to report every slight ailment to the 
medical officer who will watch every case and endeavour by 
every means in his power to discover the onset of the disease 
and by early isolation check the spread of the disease Should 
a case of small pox occur every man on board the ship must 
be vaccinated Should the ship be in a port where there is 
hospital accommodation cases should be landed immediately 
and should the case be one of suspicion only it is better that 
the patient should be landed for isolation and observation fo 
a few days than run any risk of the disease occurring on board 
If care is taken to isolate cases immediately on the appear 
ance of the disease and attention be paid to details the spread 
of the disease is practically limited and the chance of an epi 
demic on board is reduced to a minimum Whether any good 
result would accrue from the use of aerial disinfection such as 
carbolic vapour or spray which could be used during the 
treatment of the disease and at the same time be innocuous 
and pleasant to the patient I must leave to those who have 
had some experience of their use 
SANITATION IN CAMPS 
By Major James RAMC 
A subject which covers too much ground to be more than 
touched in one paper which therefore consists of a series of 
suggestions cannot pretend to be complete on any one point 
But its importance cannot be exaggerated when one considers 
the proportion of deaths from disease in armies to those from 
wounds 
The conditions of camps are so various and depend upon so 
many circumstances that there are few points that apply to 
all in the matter of detail The objects however to be kept 
in view in all cases are  
 i Protection of troops from weather and climate
