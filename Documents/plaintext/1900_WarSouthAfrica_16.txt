THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
A NOTE ON THE SOCALLED POISONED 
BULLET 
By G H Makins FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force in South Africa 
Pretoria July 5th 1900 
Fob some months past the waxcoated bullets employed by the 
Boers and discovered amongst captured ammunition have been 
a source of both interest and anxiety particularly to the lay 
mind in South Africa To the evil action of these suspected 
missiles many a case of suppuration and cellulitis has been 
ascribed By this time the appearance of the cartridges may 
be familiar to many of your readers but to such as are not a 
short description may be of interest It has apparently been 
the custom both by tht Boers and some ammunition manu 
facturers to coat the bulet with a layer of wax I believe on 
the theory that the missile in consequence takes the rifling 
more readily while at the same time the lubrication pre 
serves the grooving of the barrel from wear by friction How 
rapidly the latter takes place is patent to those who were 
familiar with the deep grooves seen on extracted Mauser 
bullets at the commencement of this campaign and can con 
trast them with the many almost smooth bullets met with at 
the present time  and when the hardness of the casing of 
the bullet is considered one would not expect it to be other 
wise Beyond this the Boer seldom cleans his rifle and the 
wax left may act as a preservative against erosion 
The wax coating of the various bullets I have seen differs 
in tint In the older large leaden bullets a white wax has 
been employed and the wax remains uncoloured except 
where fouled by contact with dust Many cartridges I have 
seen have had a coating of white wax applied which appa 
rently from age and perhaps the conditions under which they 
have been stored in hiding has acquired a brownish tinge 
Of the greencoloured bullets I have seen two varieties  in 
the first and less common white wax of some kind has been 
applied both to the bullet and brass case of the cartridges 
and probably from exposure to damp the latter has acquired 
an incomplete coating of verdigris which has become irregu 
larly diffused into the wax coating  in the second and more 
common variety a greentinted wax is employed in the original 
coating cases of cartridges treated in this way are numerous 
As to the composition of this wax I am unable to furnish any 
information but in support of the innocuousness of the pro 
cess I may only first repeat the opinion I expressed on a 
former occasion that the surface of the bullet clearing its 
passage through the grooves of the rifle is almost completely 
renewed only the extreme tip and base being untouched 
while th velocity with which the missile is started is such as 
to make it probable that the tip itself would be cleansed by 
the flight through the atmosphere This view as to the clean 
liness of the surface of the bullet has been most thoroughly 
confirmed in the case of the coated ones by an experiment 
performed by Captain Mitchell Wood at Capetown as long 
ago as last March 
A greencoated bullet fired by the Mauser rifle was made to 
traverse a book of white paper and then bury itself in a 
bank of sand As a result when the book was examined no 
trace of the green wax was found on the margins of the per 
foration in the paper and the casing of the bullet itself al 
though somewhat split was perfectly clean and white The 
complete disappearance of the wax is no doubt partly to be 
explained by the heat generated during the passage of the 
bullet through the rifle which although insufficient to 
cauterise the tissues is yet great enough to fuse the wax and 
in part to the actual scraping of the surface by the rifling of 
the barrel 
The Wounded at Pretoria 
Only the wounded from the Diamond Hill engagement have 
been in hospital in Pretoria hence I can give little surgical 
information of interest The service hospitals here are located 
in the Model School the Girls School the Volks Hospital 
and a building known as the Burke Hospital while the Irish 
Hospital has found a home in the splendid new Palace of 
Justice Enteric fever is still the mo3t prominent disease 
but its incidence is now happily on the wane 
THE LATE MISS KlNGSLEY 
I must not close this note without paying a modest tribute 
to the memory of Miss Kingsley of whose sad death I have 
only yesterday become aware Early in the year Miss Kingsley 
came to me with an introduction from Sir Lander Brunton 
although I had had the privilege of her acquaintance in 
England My wife at that time nursing at Wynberg took 
Miss Kingsley to the SurgeonGeneral who offered her the 
post of nursing the sick Boer prisoners at that time at Simons 
Town Miss Kingsley undertook this difficult work with 
characteristic energy she donned a Boer hat provided herself 
with a stock of cigarettes of special composition and battled 
with one of the most severe epidemics of enteric fever that 
has occurred out here The difficulties to be overcome were 
great but she overcame them all working with untiring 
cheerfulness and success infusing her own spirit and thorough 
ness into those working with her and gaining the hearts of 
the patients depressed and unhappy in their captivity and 
suspicious and fearful as to their disease The most arduous 
part of her work may be said to have been over when she was 
struck down with the same disease herself She bore her ill 
ness with the greatest fortitude and when the fatal perfora 
tion took place she courageously grasped her last chance and 
underwent an operation by Mrs Snowden Much as the t u geon 
dreads one of these operations and confident as I am that she 
was in the best of hands I cannot but feel a personal regret 
that I was too far distant to be able to fulfil her wish that I 
should undertake this for her It was perhaps characteristic 
of Miss Kingsley that all she asked was that if she had to die 
that 
 
she should be allowed to die alone and that she should 
be buried at sea To so great a traveller and so ardent a lover 
of Nature these desires seem both fitting and natural and she 
has found her last restingplace in the sea that she loved 
and among its denizens who formed her chief interest in the 
realm of Nature I think we as a profession may all be proud 
that the daughter of one of our brethren did such noble and 
disinterested work out here and met her death as a real heroine 
Miss Kingsleys remains were accorded the rare if not unique 
honour for a woman of both a military and naval funeral 
The military service having been performed on shore the 
coffin was placed on board HMS Thrush and committed to 
the deep with naval honours some 20 miles from the shore 
SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS 
From our Capetown Correspondent 
The Woodstock Hospital 
July 18th 1900 
As the No 5 General Hospital at Woodstock is the one at 
which the principal work at the base is being carried on and 
as it has probably reached somethuig like its final stage of 
development a somewhat detailed description of it may be of 
interest if only from the fact that it constitutes now the 
nearest South African approach to a general hospital at home 
Moreover as a reference to some of my previous articles will 
show it has grown from very small beginnings in the course of 
the present war a fact that goes some way to prove that the 
army medical officials can bring constructive ability to bear 
upon occasion The position as I have pointed out before is not 
a good one either from the sanitary or the aesthetic point of view 
and perhaps its only recommendation is that it is in close 
proximity to the railway station Situated on a lowlying piece 
of shore on which nothing will grow it is dusty and wind 
swept in summer a swamp in winter and noisy at all times 
But for the ordinary work of a garrison station hospital it was 
handy to the castle and the main barracks and no one foresaw 
that it would ever have to be turned into a general hospital 
The best had to be done with the only available site and 
apparently the best has been done 
 The hospital now consists of the permanent building that 
is the original station hospital an old and somewhat ram 
shackle double storeyed brick building large huts smaller 
ditto and marquees with a few bell tents The old building 
consists of two wings each containing four elevenbed wards 
two on each floor with a large central block used as quarters 
for medical officers and nurses with small wards for prisoners 
isolation and ophthalmic cases and a number of stores and 
offices Some of the latter are housed in a recently erected 
iron building in one of the quadrangles The wards are roomy 
and airy enough and their bareness has been much relieved

by a number of little accessories and decorations some sup 
plied by authority others by the outside public No reason 
able objection canbe made to them on the score of cleanliness 
for the most scrupulous care is evident in regard to this point 
but from the age of the building the floors are necessarily 
worn and dingy and superficial observers might rashly assume 
them to be dirty forgetting that no amount of scrubbing can 
make old floors look white The wards on each upper floor are 
approached by roomy landings used normally as lounges for 
the more or less convalescent patients who in the rainy 
weather now prevalent in the Cape peninsula cannot spend 
much time in the open air On occasions of exceptional pres 
sure caused by the sudden arrival of large drafts of convales 
cents from up country beds are occasionally made up on the 
floors of these landings but this never lasts more than a few 
days pending departures to England and certainly no dis 
comfort to speak of has been endured 
Each set of wards has an annexe for cleansing purposes and 
another as a sisters room On the ground floor of each wing 
of the permanent building is a dispensary serving the left 
and right divisions respectively The total capacity of the 
permanent building is somewhat under 100 beds There are 
six principal huts substantially built of iron lined with 
wood floored and lighted as is the old building with electric 
light These are most comfortable and in fact preferable in 
many respects to the main building Each of these huts has 
36 beds 
There are four huts of iron of a more or less temporary 
nature less substantially built than those just named but 
comfortable enough for the class of patients mostly conva 
lescents sent into them Their capacity is also 36 each 
There are also 7 portable huts built in sections of 25 beds 
These could easily be taken down and reerected in a very 
ehort time There are 2 infectious huts of 10 beds each well 
built and floored with wood Some infectious cases are occa 
sionally put into bell tents An observation hut for 10 
patients and a number of marquees and bell tents all 
woodenfloored complete the accommodation for patients 
which totals up to 804 
Two of the large huts are specially set apart for enteric 
cases and a fair proportion of the beds in the permanent 
building are also allocated to the same disease Generally 
peaking one of the groundfloor wards in the main building 
is reserved for surgical cases and the other seven wards are 
as far as possible devoted to serious medical cases Of course 
classification is most difficult to carry out with the sudden 
influxes of patients from up country but it is enforced as far 
as possible 
The dining hall is an iron structure capable of seating 
more than 200 patients The convalescents take their meals 
there and it is also used for Divine service and for recreation 
purposes including concerts which by the praiseworthy 
efforts of the outside public are frequently given 
There are eight or ten Boers at Woodstock at present 
accommodated in a separate hut All are absolutely con 
valescent and being fed up on luxuries galore Indeed the 
dietary throughout the hospital is liberal to a fault extras being 
absolutely unrestricted and practically every man gets every 
thing he asks for unless precluded by actual medical reasons 
A commodious operating room of iron is now being erected 
There are libraries attached to each set of wards There is a 
postoffice in the old building 
The staff now consists of LieutenantColonel Williamson in 
command Major Russell secretary and registrar Majors 
Gibson and Saunders in charge of divisions  one Militia 
BurgeonLieutenant who acts as company officer  one 
Volunteer SurgeonLieutenant holding a temporary commis 
sion in theRAMC  and 10 civil surgeons besides a quarter 
master 
The nursing staff consists of the superintendent who has 
also sole charge of all gifts contributed from outside and 13 
Sisters Part of these are accommodated in the hospital and 
part in a hired house near by 
The detachment consists of 1 RAMC warrant officer 3 
etaflsergeants RAMC 2 staffsergeants VMSC and 1 
St John Ambulance 6 sergeants VMSC and 3 St John 
sergeants 48 corporals and privates RAMC n Militia 
M8C corporals and privates 75 VMSC corporals and 
privates and 33 St John men Four of the Militia privates 
are specially enlisted compounders and of course a large 
number of the company are employed in the kitchen stores 
and offices The RAMC warrant officer is assisted by an 
acting sergeantmajor who takes his duties at night and two 
sergeants are engaged as wardmasters during the day and 
one at night Two nursing sisters and about 20 men are per 
manently engaged on night duty supplemented by special 
orderlies as occasion requires An orderly medical officer is 
constantly on duty all the officers below the divisional 
officers except the senior civil surgeon taking turns on this 
roster The orderly medical officer likewise visits the castle 
cells A medical officer detailed for outside duties at the 
barracks and amongst the castle staff is attached to the No 5 
unit but does no hospital duty and is not included in the 
list of the staff given above 
The professional staff is amply sufficient to ensure the most 
careful attention being given to every case and they are a very 
well qualified set of gentlemen one being a MRCP of 
London The subordinate staff is pretty heavily worked and 
a good manyan average I believe of about 20are con 
stantly noneffective through sickness mostly enteric Three 
orderlies have died from this disease already Regimental 
orderlies are now and then drafted in to fill the gap tem 
porarily caused by 
illness No nurses have contracted enteric 
and only one medical officer and his case is clearly traceable 
to postmortem work 
The general conclusion one draws from a look over No 5 is that 
the patients are comfortable and exceptionally well fedfar 
better indeed than the average rich civilianand that here 
at least no foundation exists for the strictures passed upon 
the medical administration 
A Campaign of Criticism 
A new development of the campaign of criticism has come 
out in the publication of a letter accusing the medical officers 
at Wynberg and elsewhere of partiality in their selection of 
cases for invaliding but on the whole there is a general dis 
position not to anticipate the investigations of the Com 
mission 
Personally I do not think that Commission will find 
much evidence of preventable discomfort to patients 
although it may be able to suggest some modifications in 
Army Medical organisation whilst the testimony of the large 
number of civil surgeons at present employed may throw some 
light on the etiology of the paucity of candidates for com 
missions in the RAMC 
As an instance of the loose way in which statements are 
circulated to the detriment of the Department I may mention 
that some weeks ago it was announced in the Cape Times that 
the secretary of the Soldiers Christian Association had re 
ceived a request from the principal medical officer of one of 
the military hospitals for shirts socks and warm clothing 
 
badly 
 
required for the patients and inviting the public to 
send to the said secretary any such articles This of course 
gave the impresion that the principal medical officer in 
question could not get these necessaries from official sources 
and had to appeal to outside Now as a matter of fact there is 
an ample supply of all these articles at the hospital in 
question but the secretary voluntarily offered some pyjamas 
and other things which were naturally gratefully accepted 
and on his offering to supply more he was told that they would 
be thankfully received but nothing in any way approaching an 
appeal was made or was necessary 
NOTES FROM THE SEAT OF WAR 
From a Correspondent 
The Commission of Inquiry from a South African Stand 
point 
On the whole medical officers in South Africa manifest but 
slight interest in the forthcoming Committee of Inquiry This 
is no doubt due to the fact that one and all feel convinced that 
the inquiry will result in a complete vindication of the 
RAMC It may perhaps also lead to the introduction of a 
few muchneeded reformsreforms which have already 
been advocated by many of the officers If these are conceded 
in a liberal spirit they will undoubtedly tend to strengthen and 
consolidate the corps and will prove beneficial in every way 
There can be little doubt that the inquiry will still further 


446 mJ NOTES FROM THE SEAT OF WAR Aug 18 190a 
bring home to the nation the sterling quality of the medical 
and surgical work which has been done during the campaign 
and will in this way also tend to strengthen the position of 
the corps 
From telegrams published here it would seem that 
Mr BurdettCoutts has now qualified his original statement by 
announcing that it was not meant as an attack on the 
personnel of the RAMC but applied only to the system 
This however is rather a lame explanation for the system is 
the  
personnel in the sense that without the system the 
personnel could not exist as it exists today Without the 
system the personnel if it existed at all would be an 
untrained and more or less useless body 
Mr BurdettCoutts doubtless meant that his attack was 
directed against the corps as at present constituted and not 
against its individual members It is presumed therefore 
that the attack was started with the object of weakening and 
discrediting the corps thus causing its overthrow and erecting 
on its ashes a renovated regimental system which is still 
the chimera of the  combatant  
officer Think what it would 
mean if Mr BurdettCoutts were to accomplish his object 
always presuming that his object is as above stated A corps 
of highly trained officers and men who are always ready to 
proceed to any place where their services may be required 
would be split up into its individual atoms if I may use such 
a term and distributed in twos and threes amongst the 
regiments which now form our army They would become 
isolated units incapable of collective action tied to their 
regiments however urgently their services might be required 
in another direction In other words we should have returned 
to the medical organisation which existed in the days of the 
Crimea Where then would be the general the stationary 
and the field hospitals whose work during the campaign will 
probably survive as a record in military surgery which will 
be pointed at with envy by Continental armies For criticise 
the administration of individual hospitals as we may the 
fact remains that the collective surgical results of the cam 
paign have been successful in an eminent degree 
A Typical Field Hospital 
Several detailed descriptions of general and stationary hos 
pitals have been published from time to time from which it j will have been seen that these units are equipped on a scale 
corresponding to station hospitals in England and that they 
are as a rule models of neatness and comfort Hitherto field 
hospitals have been more or less overlooked by your corre 
spondents I am therefore induced to send the following 
brief notes on an inspection of one of these hospitals as 
doubtless they will prove interesting to your readers especially 
as there is reason to believe that recent adverse comments 
have been mainly levelled at these units What follows 
however will tend to show how little justification there is for 
such adverse criticisms In this case the unit selected was 
No 15 Field Hospital it being the only representative of its 
class then stationed in Bloemfontein 
Before entering on its description I may premise that a 
field hospital is equipped for 100 patients it is attached to a 
brigade and moves with it wherever it goes It is essential 
therefore that the equipment should be as light and portable 
as possible This consists of field medical and surgical 
panniers an operating and thirtynine circular tents etc 
To insure lightness and portability the medicines are in tab 
loid form All told the equipment weighs roughly 8 tons and 
can easily be carried on four ox or five mule waggons A 
field hospital receives the sick from its brigade and all 
wounded that may be brought to it oy the bearer companies 
The serious cases are transferred to the base as soon as pos 
sible only slight cases which are expected to be fit for duty 
in a few days being retained in the hospital This rule how 
ever has been frequently modified during the present cam 
paign as in the following instance  
Before leaving England No 15 Field Hospital was detailed 
for duty with the Fifth Irish Brigade It landed at Durban 
on December ist 1899 the officers with the unit being Major 
G H Younge in command Major F T Wilkinson Captain 
E M Pilcher Lieutenant R H S Fuhr Lieutenant and 
Quartermaster J Hirst Having drawn its transport at 
Pietermaritzburg the hospital joined its brigade at Frere on 
December 8th 1899 and was present with it at the battles of 
Colenso Spion Kop Yal Krantz Pieters Hill and the relief 
of Lady smith The hospital was subsequently ordered to 
Bloemfontein Since arriving here it has been attached to 
the Third Division and has been detailed to treat the sick 
from the various rest camps and from the drafts which are 
continually passing through the station It rapidly became 
filled with enteric fever cases and to accommodate these 
additional tents and equipments had to be drawn The hos 
pital now consists of 65 tents 18 of these being marquees 
The camp is pitched on a level plain west of the town It 
is rectangular in shape and covers an area of 140 by 250 
yards The bell tents are pitched in six rows with an 
interval of 16 yards between each row the marquees in two 
separate rows on the south side of the camp On the south 
side also corrugated iron latrines and a large washstand and on 
the east a pretty corrugated iron cookhouse have been erected 
From whatever point the camp is viewed the tents are in 
perfect alignment with a broad avenue between each row As 
the tents are snow white and the site smooth and well kept 
the whole forms a neat and pleasing picture In rear of the 
camp are the mortuary tent a marquee for hospital stores 
the horse lines etc The marquee is kept well stocked 
with large reseives of medical comforts and warm under 
clothing which are issued liberally to the patients whenever 
necessary The sanitary arrangements receive especial atten 
tion The camp is 
scrupulously clean not even the tiniest 
scrap of paper being visible All refuse is at once burnt all 
waste water being emptied into a deep pit filled with broken 
stones through which it rapidly percolates Chloride of lime 
is freely used for disinfecting the waste water 
For excretions and clothing izal is almost exclusively em 
ployed Large supplies of both are on hand The hospital is 
now almost entirely occupied by enteric fever cases and the 
marquees are reserved for these Three nursing sisters are 
doing duty in the enteric fever wards 
Each marquee is 14 by 30 feet They are provided with 
double roofs and walls and comfortably accommodate 7 beds 
Those in use in the hospital are wirewove spring beds which 
are found light portable and very comfortable The beds are 
placed round the marquees at right angles to the walls This 
leaves a large space in the centre in which stands a long 
table In the centre of this is an elevated tray on which are 
placed feedingbottles medicine bottles etc The remainder 
of tbe table is covered with books and illustrated papers 
Beside each bed stands a bedside table The marquees are 
bright and neat and every article in them is spotlessly clean 
The floor of each marquee is covered with a double layer of 
tarpaulin which is found safer more comfortable and much 
more convenient than wood 
Each bell tent accommodates three beds arranged so as to 
form three sides of a square The patients are provided with 
mattresses blankets sheets and pyjamas Most of them 
are now convalescent and those who are allowed up wear the 
regulation blue hospital clothing in which they look neat and 
smart One and all speak in the highest terms of the treat 
ment they have received and express indignation at the 
charges which have been brought against the hospitals in 
South Africa 
I append a few figures which have been jotted down from 
the hospital returns They will show that although field 
hospitals are only equipped for 100 patients they are capable 
of doing much good work 
Since its arrival in South Africa the followingare the

These figures represent a very large amount of work The 
deathrate works out to a fraction under 233 per cent Of the 
cases which have passed through the hospital 732 have been 
discharged to duty 120 are still under treatment whilst the 
remainder have at different times been transferred to the

both its equipment and record 
RELIEVED MAFEKING 
Writing from Deelfontein on July 16th Mr A D Fripp 
says  There is not a siugle seriously sick or wounded man 
now left in Mafeking Fuel is still very scarce up here the 
locomotives having to depend on wood of which they draw a 
huge truck after them Of food there is plenty and of danger 
there is none But in all other respects very little change 
has as yet come over Mafeking since it was relieved 
Trophies and mementos of the siege of all sorts are in great 
demand both at Mafeking itself and also down country Siege 
stamps paper money shells and bullets occupy the most 
prominent place in most peoples minds and realise most 
extraordinarily high prices but Professor Chiene who was 
visiting us not long ago is the possessor of one of the most 
interesting mementos in the shape of a concertina whereby 
in conjunction with the noiee made by a native dancing on a 
sheet of corrugated iron the Boers were tempted to put up 
their heads when only separated from our sharpshooters 
by about 60 yards Many Boers paid for their 
curiosity with their lives for the moment anything showed 
above the sandbags it got a bullet through it  even a cartridge 
case which is only 2J inches by less than half an inch left by 
chance on the top of the sandbags got two bullets put through 
it There are some field glasses made on such an arrangement 
of angles and prisms that by their aid a man in a trench can 
spy over the top without exposing his head I saw one such 
glass which had had a Mauser bullet bang through its lens 
and also through the hat of the person who was using it 
Throughout the siege they seem to have been remarkably 
free from sickness despite the fact that Mafeking is as inno 
cent as any other town in South Africa of any attempt at 
sanitation I am glad to say that sickness among the staff 
here has materially diminished of late Only twentyone of 
our orderlies are in hospital and they are all doing well and 
so are the two doctors who are convalescent from enteric and 
a couple of sisters who are off duty for slight ailments This 
most satisfactory statement seems to be general throughout 
the country The epidemic of enteric continues to rapidly 
decrease Sloggett who is just back from Pretoria whither 
he had to go to make arrangements for the new advanced 
branch of the Yeomanry Hospital the first instalment of 
which is due at Capetown tomorrow says that there are only 
400 sick and wounded in that city and only 1600 in Bloem 
fontein instead of the 5000 that there were when I was there 
six weeks ago He says that there are two whole general 
hospitals now in Kroonstad besides the Glasgow Hospital of 
300 beds but there as at Kimberley where I visited the 
hospitals on my way to Mafeking and everywhere else that 
the hospital trains ply to the report is extremely favourable 
and there are vacant beds everywhere now The difficulty of 
transport however continues Between Kroonstad and 
Johannesburg it is even greater than it was owing of course 
to the depredations of Christian de Wet 
We have taken in nearly 250 patients this week including 
one train from Winburg half sick and half wounded and one 
train load of convalescents from Pretoria and about fifty 
Yeomanry including a batch of the Warwicks and a batch 
fiom Kimberley 
THE STANDARDISING OF DRUGS BY 
EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS 
The Home Secretary recently asked the Royal College of 
Physicians and of Surgeons to advise him in reference to an 
application from a firm of manufacturing chemists for a 
licence for the performance at their laboratories of experi 
ments on living animals for the purpose of standardising 
drugs The views of the Royal Colleges were specially re 
quested on the following three questions  
i Is the standardising of drugs by means of experiments 
on animals indispensable in the public interest  
 
2  
If so is it probable that in proper cases dulyqualified 
experimenters working in the premises of manufacturing 
chemists should be empowered to perform the necessary ex 
periments on animals for this purpose  
 
3 If it is not thought desirable that manufacturing 
chemists should be entrusted with this power what other 
provision is it advisable and practicable to make for the pur 
pose  
 
The letter was referred to the Laboratories Committee con 
sisting of Dr PyeSmith Chairman Drs Halliburton and 
S Martin Mr Howse Sir William MacCormac and Mr H 
Morris for consideration and report 
In a report dated July 3rd the Committee replied to the 
first question that with certain remedies containing active 
agents which cannot be estimated by any known chemical 
process experiments on animals usually rabbits guineapigs 
or mice are absolutely necessary in order that their thera 
peutical strength may be estimated This applies more par 
ticularly to the group of remedial agents antiserums anti 
toxins etc which have been introduced for the treatment of 
infective diseases In the case for example of the diphtheria 
antitoxin which is the only preparation of this kind at present 
in general use the antitoxin strength of each sample of serum 
as it is obtained from the horse has to be estimated since 
individual horses even if treated in the same manner yield 
serum of different strengths The antitoxic strength must be 
ascertained by determining what amount of the serum will 
exactly counteract a known amount of the toxin or poison of 
the diphtheria bacillus when both substances are injected 
into the same animal usually a guineapig The strength of 
both toxin and antitoxin cannot be estimated by chemical 
means so that a physiological test becomes necessary An 
unstandardised antitoxin is a source of danger for the prac 
titioner might be relying on a remedy which would not pro 
duce the effect required and life would be endangered or 
might be lost from using a more or less inert preparation 
To the second question the Committee replied that they 
would regard the authorisation of the necessary experiments 
in the premises of manufacturing chemists as highly un 
desirable They pointed out that even in the event of such 
firms being able to obtain the services of experimenters of 
such acknowledged skill and experience as to guarantee the 
accuracy of the work the standardisation of antitoxic serum 
by experiment is still a matter of investigation and improve 
ment A competent worker on the subject must be conver 
sant with others working at the same and kindred subjects in 
the various research laboratories at home and abroad More 
over it is difficult to foresee to what extent the grant of 
licences to manufacturing chemists would be carried if any 
are issued for it would be a matter of difficulty to determine 
which firms would be permitted to perform experiments and
