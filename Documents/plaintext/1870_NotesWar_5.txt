13 The general conditions under which chloral is to be administered 
are the same as those which regulate the administration of chloroform 
and the rules laid down by Sir James Simpson in connexion with this 
subject must be rigidly adhered to

ALLEGED MIURDER OF A SURGEON 
A CORRESPONDENT of the Daily Tedegraph states that a Turco while 
having his wounds dressed by Dr Mettenzweig of Oranienburg near 
Berlin stabbed him with a knife as he was turning aside to arrange the 
bandages and other materials Dr Mettenzweig died at the end of six 
days 
TIIE LAZARETTES IN BERLIN

SURGERY AT SEDAN 
DR WV MACCORNIAC of the AngloAmerican Ambulance has written 
to Colonel Lindsay an interesting description of the proceedings of him 
self and his colleagues during and after the battle of Sedan On the 
Ist September the caserne in which they were was in the direct line of 
a constant fire carried on by the Germans for six hours The building 
was bombproof but the shells raked the wards from window to win 
dow killing one hospitalhelper and severely wounding another Dr 
MacCormac was constantly employed for several days in operating the 
operations comprising two cases each of ligature of the subclavian and 
of the carotid arteries excisions of joints and innumerable amputa 
tions Attempts at conservative surgery in cases of injury of bones 
have not been satisfactory even where the injury has at first appeared 
slight The Prussian bullets splinter bones in everv direction gene 
rally to such an extent as to demand immediate resection or amputation 
Up to the i6th the date of the letter there had been no erysipelas 
hospital gangrene or pyoemia and but one case of secondary haemor 
rhage after operations This immunity from epidemic disease he ascribes 
to the copious use of carbolic acid and especially to free ventilation 
The windows of the rooms were kept wide open at all timesto the 
great horror of a French intendantgeneral who told Dr MacCormac 
and his colleagues that they were going to kill their patients with 
courants of air 
A DEFENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY 
MR BERKELEY HILL and Mr Ernest Hart who have been inspecting 
the ambulances of the British Aid Society in the Sedan district have 
written to the Daily Telegrajh a letter in which the deny the state 
ment recently made by a correspondent of that paper that in no single 
mnilitary ambulance have the amateur medical assistants taken off their 
coats so to speak and gone to work like men at what they are en 
gaged to do They complain that the correspondent has mixed 
up all the ambulancesBritish French Belgian etcin one com 
mon condemnation They point out that as regards the French sur 
geons the charge of indifference is not applicable In the French 
ambulance the very moment that one of us entered the hospital M 
Tilleaux was performing disarticulation of the arm at the shoulderjoint 
aided by some of his assistants while others were dressing in the wards 
The joy with which they received our medical stores taking only what 
was strictly necessary betokens no want of interest in their work  and 
having had no inconsiderable experience of hospital work in which we 
have been engaged all our professional lives we have seen no signs of 
loafing but on the contrary of earnest and devoted work Of the 
medical officers in the service of the British Society the writers of the 
letter say that their conduct has been beyond praise  and they protest 
against the implication far more the direct statement that those 
who have enlisted under the British Society are careless or idle They 
repeat the statement that has been already made that there is a crowd 
of loafers wearing the red cross but they believe that if their badges 
were examined not one would be found to bear the stamp of the Bri 
tish International Society and that the wearers are not directly at 
tached to the foreign ambulances Messrs Hill and Hart state that 
they found very general evidences of a want of organisation and of de 
ficiency in the means of communication and supply between the red 
cross ambulances of the British and Foreign Societies The real diffi 
culty for the British Society they write has been in the sudden and mar 
vellously rapid development of its resources which left little time in 
deed for the regular organisation of its now gigantic task and in 
the entire absence of any previous machinery to be used for the pur 
pose To improvise a large series of ambulances suddenly in a foreign 
country occupied by combatant forces with all kinds of impediments 
to traffic and difficulties of transport would have puzzled very wise and 
experienced heads even where the extent and localities were of neces 
sity accurately known and the amount of resources was ascertained 
Moreover the first administrators sent out were inexperienced and 
many employed are still so The authors of the letter have laid before 
Captain Brackenbury the chief agent of the British Society here and 
have written home to Colonel Lindsay some detailed criticisms and 
suggestions Many of them had been anticipated by Captain Bracken 
bury who they believe concurs in all On the large scale on which 
the British Society is now able to work more numerous centres of 
action must be taken Experienced administrators such as deputy 
inspectors of the hospitals of the army or navy are wantedone at 
each centre experienced commissariat officers and an organised intel 
ligence department All these wants could not be accurately forecast 
they are on the way to be rapidly fulfilled Meantime thousands have 
been comforted and saved by the British Society and both France and 
Germany have cause to bless its name 
THE GERMAN FIELDHOSPITALS 
THE following is from a correspondent 
On the 13th of September an order was issued from Berlin not to esta 
blish any more new hospitals for the wounded as a great number of 
beds are empty and the present accommodation appears amply suffi 
cient How great the available number of beds all over Germany 
must be can be guessed if we mention that such towns as for instance 
Frankfort or Mannheim have made up from I200 to 1500 beds each 
and that even the smallest places would not stand behind but wanted 
to have a few wounded soldiers to nurse Everywhere the local prac 
titioners attend them and the nursing is done by trained nurses and 
sisters of charity assisted by ladies of all ranks The hospitals are 
mostly temporary wooden buildings socalled barracken of a most 
simple construction the only aim of wbich is to afford protection from 
rain and to allow thorough ventilation The place of windows is taken 
by wooden frames covered with canvas which are opened whenever the 
weather allows As the cold weather lately prevailing did not admit 
of their being freely opened they have in some hospitals been replaced 
by glasswindows to admit more light and thereby to render the ward 
more cheerful These wards are mostly built entirely of wood in some 
places however part of the walls is made of bricks They have 
either no floor but the dry ground or what is much better and carried 
through in all the richer towns the floor is raised about two feet above 
the ground and the boards are soaked with oil The roof is well pro 
jecting and free ventilation is secured by open spaces where the roof 
rests on the sidewalls as well as on the crown of the roof which is 
raised two or three feet A number of such wooden houses are arranged 
either without any system at all simply as the ground at disposal has per 
mitted or they are placed in rows or more elaborately grouped round 
the kitchen which is generally the central building 
The large barrackenlazareth at Frankfort with 600 beds consists 
quite of a little town of wooden houses in three rows the houses con 
taining 20 beds each being placed with their lengths at right angles 
to the road between them At Mannheim they are arranged in the 
form of a triangle one behind the other and connected one with an 
other by a covered passage The sides of this triangle are flanked by 
two large wards of 34 beds each the other wards containing only 22 
These larger wards have raised floors and windows The closets are 
either partitioned off at one end of the ward the same as the scullery 
or they are altogether outside and projecting from the wards Moules 
earthclosets are much used at Frankfort but at Mannheim and other 
places they use barrels with sulphate of iron or zinc and other disinfec 
tants these barrels are emptied every day 
There are not many severely wounded at Frankfurt but a great many 
are to be found at Mannheim and Darmstadt These are the places 
where good surgery and the most modern appliances for the treatment 
of compound fractures can be seen At Darmstadt Professor Lucke 


Oct I 1870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 70URNAL 37 
of Bern is at the head of the hospitals assisted by a staff of young Swiss 
surgeons At Mannheim Professor Bergmann of Dorpat with several 
Russian surgeons and Dr Lossen of Halle manage the two largest 
barrackenlazareth whilst Professor Billroth of Vienna acts as con 
sulting surgeon for the whole of the Mannheim hospitals The work 
in these hospitals is done with a regularity and order not exceeded by any 
permanent clinical hospital the staffs of young surgeons being suffi 
ciently numerous to take temperatures in all severe cases and to make 
notes of the more interesting ones There were a good many patients 
that had undergone serious operationsabout halfadozen resections 
of the head of the humerus several excisions of the elbow a number 
of amputations several cases in which ligature of an important artery 
had been made bulletwounds in all possible and apparently impos 
sible directions narrow escapes from balls having passed through the 
neck and having just spared the carotid or through the inguinal region 
without injuring the femoral artery bullets having passed through the 
knee or anklejoint without setting up suppuration etc Plaster of Paris 
is most extensively used A very convenient swinging apparatus which 
is much used in conmpound fractures of the lower extremity consists of 
a plaster of lParis bandage in which runs a narrow iron splint with 
three projecting rings for suspension along the front of the leg Pro 
fessor Volkmann of Halle is the originator of this method and he has 
also most conveniently modified what is known in England as the Ame 
rican method of treating fractures of the thigh by simple extension 
without splints Instead of attaching the string bearing the weight im 
mediately to the loop of adhesive plaster he interposes a small piece of 
wood which is placed horizontally and which rests and freely moves on 
the edges of two triangular blocks of wood lying on a board one at 
each side of the foot This arrangement makes the extension much 
more steady 
Behind the large barrackenlazareth at Mannheim is a tenthos 
pital containing 32 beds established by the Dutcb Drs Schubart and 
Brondgeest of Utrecht being the chief surgeons They brought their 
tents beds nurses and every thing with them The whole has a very 
cheerful aspect 
In the Palatinate we had an opportunity to observe the very strict 
measures which have been taken to stamp out the cattleplague which 
unfortunately has made its appearance in several places A military 
cordon is placed round the affected villages all the animals in a stable 
where a single case has appeared are doomed to destruction the most 
rigid disinfection of the stable is carried out Small disinfecting huts 
are established at all the chief roads coming out of a village  and every 
one leaving the village is bound by a heavy penalty to stay a few minutes 
in an atmosphere of chlorilne before he is allowed to proceed on his 
journey We had to undergo this fumigating process twice yesterday 
afternoon Horses and cattle are disinfected by washing their feet with 
water containing chloride of lime Cats and dogs are not allowed to be 
at large It is to be expected that by these strict measures the further 
spread of the disease will be prevented 
September 20th 1870 
THE GERAIAN AID SOCIETIES 
OUR correspondent at Berlin writes as follows under date Sept 26th 
I have now to speak at present about the private societies found 
every where and having for their purpose either the relief of the 
sick and wounded or the support of the families of reserve and Land 
wehr men who have entered the army or the relief of the troops them 
selves by sending refreshments etc or as most of them fulfilling all 
these purposes at once For their common interests all the local 
societies for the relief of the sick and wounded throughout Germany 
have a Central Committee formed of delegates and stationed in Berlin 
Unter den Linden I12 This Committee has charge of the intercourse 
and correspondence with foreign aid societies and gives directions to 
the local societies in regard of the places where and the manner in 
which help is wanted Nevertheless the local and provincial socie 
ties may under direct communication with the Central Committee 
support the hospitals in their own neighbourhood and their own re 
spective troops and may independently order materials where they are 
wanted Besides the local depots of materials clothes bandages 
medicines food etc there is a Central Depot also at Berlin general 
depots resorting of it at Coblenz Mainz Mannheim and depending 
on these special depots at Saarlouis Saarbriicken Weissenburg 
Hagenau Courcelles Remilly Nancy PontaMousson Sedan and 
various other places Now and then the Central DepOt publishes 
lists of the objects sent by them For instance I quote from the last 
list IOOO trunks with charpie 2000 with plaster of Paris Iioo 
pounds of carbolic acid 2000 pounds of chloroform 237 pounds of 
tincture of opium 2000000 of cigars 26oooo bottles of claret 
The number of beds prepared by private societies existing in all 
the larger towns of Germany as Leipzig Magdeburg Hanover etc 
for the reception of sick and wounded is enormous and we are glad to 
say surpasses everywhere the amount actually necessary so that you 
may often find in the papers complaints about not yet having received 
the expected wounded Corresponding to the size and means of the 
town the largest of these local societies is the  Berlin Aid Society for 
the German Field Armies By its own means this society established a 
hospital of four hundred beds in the Uhlans barrack and built on the 
field of Templehof fourteen barracks for thirty patients each The fur 
nishment and management in the hospitals are excellent in some 
points I should think even too luxurious Besides this society there 
are in Berlin a number of smaller societies formed by private circles or in 
single parishes and following one or some of the purposes above 
named In this way there are here more than a dozen of hospitals ad hoc 
for twenty to fifty patients each The large permanent civil hospitals 
as the Charite St IHedwigs Hospital St Elizabeth Hospital etc 
receive also a certain number of military patients I may add that by 
the military authorities three large caserns and the halls of the Central 
turnanstadt are arranged as hospitals so they have at their disposal 
alone together with the garrison hospital and the new wooden bar 
racks about two thousand beds In the beginning of the war the 
wounded were sent to the different hospitals without regarding their 
nationality but byandbye affairs of discipline made it necessary to 
send the French to the exclusively military hospitals where they might 
be under a stricter superintendence 
Though not really belonging to the Aid for the Sick and Wounded 
I mention in a few words the societies already referred to which sup 
port the families of reserve and Landwehr men Success has shown 
what may be done by an army like the German composed of civilians 
and originating out of every class of society and every calling but 
proportionally large is the influence of this organisation on home 
affairs In consequence of the mobilisation many thousands of wives 
and children are destitute and unable to support themselves alone 
Hence it is quite necessary to support these families to a certain degree 
Besides numerous parish committees five large societies have been 
originated for this purpose to ensure as judicious and correct as pos 
sible a distribution of their means They have now formed a Central 
Board under the presidency of Mr Seydel Mayor of Berlin 
With the beginning of the cold season public opinion thinks about 
sending refreshments spirits and warm clothes to our troops  innu 
merable stockings flannelshirts sashes etc are bought by local com 
mittees and are to be sent in special trains to the different army corps 
From the beginning of the mobilisation measures were taken by pri 
vate and by public authorities to refresh the passing troops on the rail 
way stations large and small towns emulated each other in doing so 
At Berlin the most extensive arrangements were made on the east 
station Mrs Lina Morgenstern who has managed for some years the 
Berlin  Volkskiichen institutions furnishing the workingclasses 
with good and cheap dinnersin a most excellent way has to the 
general satisfaction the superintendence of these arrangements Within 
the last few weeks at the same stations dressingplaces have been 
made ready for the trains of wounded who pass Berlin and go to more 
distant hospitals The medical arrangements at the stations are under 
the charge of a number of Berlin surgeons who have made it their duty 
to be present when the trains bringing the wounded are announced 
The cattleplague observed a few weeks since in the Palatinate and 
supposed to be brought in with the Hungarian cattle has broken out spo 
radically at different places in Germany Some villages near Berlin are 
surrounded with a military cordon on account of the outbreak gene 
rally the strictest measures are taken to avoid a spread of the disease 
In I866 permanganate of potash was the antiseptic remedy d 1 
mode this year it is carbolic acid In every hospital it is used on the 
largest scale for dressing and washing wounds in more or less strict 
accordance with the directions of Mr Lister 
The following is a part of a report from Donchery dated September 
17th Four thousand six hundred and seventyseven Germans have been 
up to this day sent home through Belgium  a few more may be sent in 
ten days or a fortnight For this purpose Messrs von Stein and vor 
Tettan will stay in Libramont and Bouillon until the Ist October and 
will be so able to finish their work there entirely Mr von Albedyll 
and Count Kleist remain here the latter after breaking up the station 
at Neufchateau went for a few days only to Libramont Generally the 
evacuation of the wounded is very difficult from the want of carriages 
It was in vain tried on our part by the IntendantGeneral and Mr 
Hubert Salatin to send on the wounded by the railway through Mezieres 
and Givet The EtappenInspector of the army of the Meuse wished 
to establish large hospitals at Sedan and to send the patients thence 
through Belgium but General Boeger thought the air of Sedan and its 
neighbourhood too unhealthy
