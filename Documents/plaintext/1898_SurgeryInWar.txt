MODERN SURGERY IN WAR 
THE announcement that it has been found possible to bring 
home some of the woundedin Egypt without changing the 
aseptic dressings applied when tthewoundsjwere first treated 
will have been heard with great satisfaction It is in fact 
a triumph for good surgery and good organisation and 
proves that military surgery has shared to the full in the 
remarkable advance in surgical ideals and methods which 
the present generation has witnessed The ideals which 
surgeons have had before them in regard to the healing of 
wounds at various epochs form indeed a very interesting 
part of the history of surgery and especially of military 
surgery Very great changes have taen place in the 
standards set up even in our own times and nothing has 
ever done more to diminish the sufferings of the wounded 
than the introduction of aseptic methods which render it 
not only unnecessary but undesirable to resort to the fre 
quent dressing of wounds which used to be obligatory Many 
surgeons who have hardly yet reached middle life can 
remember the anxiety with which some Nestor of his youth 
looked out for a free discharge of what he would call 
laudable pus  from all but the simplest wounds To this 
exudation he looked to carry off especially in lacerated 
wounds all the bruised and torn tissue whose vitality was 
destroyed by the violence inflicted His ideal was only 
realised when dressings were rapidly soaked with discharges 
so that they needed to be frequently changed and he 
encouraged this state of things by poultices and fomepa1aions 
in great variety 
Later on in the earlier days of the antiseptic perind the 
hope of surgeons appeared to lie in the destruction by 
chemical antiseptics of all the forms of low vegetable life 
which under ordinary conditions gained access to most wounds 
and in the carrying off by means of numerous drainage tubes 
all blood and exuded serum which might have formed a 
favourable soil for these organisms But the drawbacks of 
this treatment soon became apparent In the laudable efforts 
to destroy the germs which were correctly recognised as the 
cause of dangerous inflammation conditions were produced 
which were actually hostile to the healing of wounded tissues 
The chemicals employed not only destroyed the microbes but 
also many of the tissue elements And not only had the 
latter to be shed off before healing could take place but in 
the process of elimination and under the stimulus of the 
germicides increased exudation took place which required 
elaborate provision for the escape of fluid from wounds and 
the reception and disinfection of the latter in special dress 
ings which called for frequent change lest they in their tum 
should become the soil for organic life This though 
tending in the right direction and affording a necessary 
transition from the older methods was based upon a false 
ideal The chemicals irritated the wounds the secretion 
was consequently greater This called for frequent inter 
ference with the injured part and consequent risk of fresh 
infection from without at each exposure But not only this 
but one of the greatest factors in healing namely physiolo 
gical rest was not maintained and the debilitated patient 
was put to much physical pain as well as psychical distress 
both serious depressants of vitality in themselves 
Our present ideal is different The highest aim of wound 
treatment is now to see that Nature is left as much as pos 
sible to herself To this end we exclude ferments from 
wounds by every known means applied to the surrounding 
air the dressing utensils instruments and hands brought 
in contact with the injured part We do as little as possible 
to the actual wound whether with antiseptics or by manipu 
lation and so secure a maximum of rest and a minimum of 
pain and fright to the patient and if by these means the 
wound is left clean and at rest Nature will do the remainder 
The case of an excision of a joint well illustrates this 
change which has come about In our fathers days if such 
an operation was attempted at all which on account of its 
greatmortality was rare free suppuration was provided for as a 
matter of course for weeks and months and the patient 
suffered untold misery all through this long after 
treatment on account of the constant dressing of the wound 
and the physical and mental unrest thereby entailed 
Then came the blessings of the antiseptic period with the 
elimination of infection but with the drain tubes and the 
still frequent dressing and interference with the damaged 
part We have now arrived at a point where by the aseptic 
treatment wounds are left in a state of rest untouched 
until healed under one dressing in nine out of ten cases It 
is indeed becoming a very common experience to see these 
large and complicated wounds of joints as well as of cther 
parts left absolutely undisturbed under the dressing put on 
at the operation until the tenth day The dressing is only 
then removed because the woand has been perfectly healed 
Indeed inconsiderate patients are often dissatisfied because 
so little has been done for their wound They 
think it ought to have been looked at at least 
once every day or so And when the surgeon who 
has put forth all his powers based upon his knowledge of 
pathological and physiological processes as well as the 
experience of countless cases points triumphantly on the 
tenth day to an absolute union without a spot of pus and 
without drainage the patient often quietly says Yes I 
have excellent healing flesh and ignores his part altogether 
ignorant of the fact that only the surgeons conecintious and 
patient carrying out of countless details in principle and 
manipulation have saved him from all the disasters of sepsis 
In some cases even he is reproached with having done so 
little and consequently receives but scant gratitude 
In no branch of surgery has this rapid evolution of ideals 
been more strikingly illustrated than in the treatment of 
bullet wounds The poultice or frequently changed water

dressing with all its foulness and risk gave way at first to 
the cumbrous ritual of the antiseptic period with its greatly 
reduced risks of septic infection but with its constant change 
of dressings and frequent irrigation with chemicals Then 
with the more perfect knowledge of the nature of infection 
and of its sources came the knowledge that these could be 
eliminated by attention to the perfect cleansing of the media 
which must almost necessarily come into contact with 
wounds sooner or later An ideal has thus been reached 
which for simplicity and the excellence of its results would 
excite our fathers could they see it almost to incredulity 
The modern soldier now carries in his knapsack simple 
simple antiseptic dressings to be applied at once by himself 
or his comrade to his wound The aim of this dressing is 
less to act as a germdestroying covering for the wound 
itself that to protect the latter from the access of microbes 
from without and with such a dressing the wound can be left 
untouched for days and frequently to complete cicatrisation 
with perfect impunity Indeed one of its greatest advantages 
is that with it exposure of the wound with all its risks of 
infection is rendered unnecessary In short the ideal which 
the civil surgeon places before himself in dealing with the 
terrible wounds of modern operations is realised in the far 
simpler wounds made by the modern smallbore projectile 
with its high velocity and cleancut hole 
Those soldiers are indeed fortunnte who when wounded fall 
into the hands of military surgeons who fully grasp the prin 
ciples of asepsis They conscientiously carry out its details 
and their confidence in the precautions for warding off sepsis 
is such that they positively forbid the removal of a dressing 
once applied to a bullet wound with due regard to asepsis so 
long as pulse temperature and general condition indicate 
that Nature is left undisturbed in her healing powers These 
surgeons will then order their patients to be removed at once 
from the seat of war with a permanent antiseptic dressing 
and so will prevent that overcrowding of field or base hospitals 
which in former days not only hampered the commanders in 
their military movements but also led to those outbursts of 
wound infections which swept away countless valuable 
lives 
Some of us who have seen the horrors of war under the 
old r4gime must feel deeply thankful that we now possess in 
our soldiersurgeons men fully impressed with the newer 
teaching and with the courage and confidence to give effect 
to it in their own noble work 
The Greek Asklepieia had a twofold character for they 
were sanatoria as well as shrines It is difficult to say which 
of these characters predominated in the earlier days pro 
bably both existed in varying degree at different times and 
in different places according to the mental constitution of 
those who had the direction of affairs As Dr Caton 
points out sometimes the Hierophant was a physician 
and in such a case it may reasonably be conjectured 
that hygiene and medical treatment had a prominent 
place in the  cure But for the most part the 
priestly element was preponderant in the staff of the 
Asklepieia and the treatment was thus largely of a spiritual 
nature Hence gradually the shrine overshadowed the 
sanatorium till the temples of Asklepios became simply 
places to which superstitious or despairing invalids resorted 
in the hope of a cure by miraculous agency As the first 
dawn of rational medicine brightened more and more into 
day the thaumaturgic powers of the shrines became dis 
credited and their glory finally departed when the old gods 
were driven from Olympus by the triumph of Christianity 
It has been said that the Asklepieia were to some extent 
sanatoria and accordingly great care seems to have been 
takens in the selection of their sites That of Epidaurue was 
situated in a pleasant valley and well sheltered by woods 
That of Athens was built on a height commanding an ex 
tensive view across the plain to the Gulf of Phaleron 2Egina 
and the mountains of Argolis It had a southern aspect 
and was protected from cold winds by the rocky eminence of 
the Acropolis The hygienic treatment consisted largely in 
baths and other hydrotherapeutic measures walking bare 
foot was also prescribed so that Asklepios may be 
said to have been a precursor of Father Kneipp 
Simplicity of diet was enjoined and bodily exercise in the 
form not only of gymnastics but of riding and hunting 
was also insisted upon in suitable cases while music and the 
drama were largely employed as adjuvants Nor was purely 
medicinal treatment neglected as is clear from the tablet to 
which Dr Caton refers on which the case of Marcus Julius 
Apellas is recorded This grateful patient whose statement 
is interesting as showing that valetudinarians in antiquity 
were curiously like unto those of the present day testifies 
that he was suffering from many afflictions not the least 
being indigestion Asklepios began his course of treatment 
by advising the patient not to be so nervous about himself 
At Epidaurus Apellas was ordered a regime of bread and curdled 
milk and a salad of parsley with lettuce he was to drink 
lemonade and also honey mixed with milk he was further 
ordered to take exercise and to rub himself in the bath but 
was nevertheless to pay the attendant his fee He was 
directed to use anise and oil for his headache and to gargle 
with cold water for a swelling in the glands When his cure 
was accomplished he was told that he must pay his fee 
and further must draw up an account of his cure Hence 
we have this record which reads amusingly like one of the 
testimonials to the marvellous virtues of the remedies offered 
to a confiding world by the vendors of modern nostrums 
But in the Asklepieia hygiene diet and medical treatment 
were always supplemented even when not altogether 
replaced by faithhealing The patients mind was prepared 
beforehand for miraculous effects by means excellently 
adapted to the production of the highest degree of  suggesti 
bility which the profane describe as gullibility writ 
FAITHHEALING IN ANCIENT GREECE 
DR CATONS lectures on the Temples and Ritual of Asklepios 
at Epidaurus and Athens are interesting in themselves as 
embodying a skilful reconstruction of one of the most pathetic 
ruins of antiquity and also as affording a proof that even in 
these days of crowded scientific life there are still among us 
some worthy successors of the old race of scholarly physicians 
who found leisure for other studies in the spacious times 
when the art of medicine was neither so long nor so absorbing 
as it is at the present day Dr Caton has clothed the dry 
bones of archaeology with flesh and has enabled us not 
only to see in the minds eye the buildings and material en 
vironment but to understand the inner life and as it were to 
breathe the spiritual atmosphere of the most celebrated 
temple of Asklepios the god of healing
