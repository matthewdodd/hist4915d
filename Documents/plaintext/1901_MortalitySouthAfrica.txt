shall probably modify its shape as with the forked and hinged stem I 
can if necessary adopt a ring or any other suitable pattern 
Fig 2Prolapse ret oversion and flexion pessary in position 
The whole apparatus can be selfapplied by the patient with 
very little instruction and it can be easily cleansed Old 
ulcrations induced by friction from badlyfitting pessaries 
or from external violence are soon cured by the use of my in 
strument as all pressure in the neighbourhood of the ulcra 
tion is removed The size of the pessary its length of stem 
etc can of course be modified to suit each particular case 
My instructions and ideas have been carried out in a most 
satisfactory manner by Messrs Krohne and Sesemann 
Without encroaching too much upon valuable space perhaps 
I may be permitted to quote one of my cases in which marked 
benefit has followed the use of my pessary  
Mrs L aged 54 mother of a numerous family for years had suffered 
from prolapsus uteri in its worst form Her occupation standing nearly 
all day much aggravated her condition Numerous pessaries had failed 
so that in despair she sometimes for days together used to perform her 
daily routine with the congested ulcerated uterus completely outside her 
body She came under my care and for a time a ring pessary specially 
made and measuring s inches in diameter gave relief But then as may 
be expected from such an instrument bowels and bladder suffered  and 
to add to her discomfort despite daily douchings a persistent foul 
smelling discharge issued per vaginam Even this pessary was frequently 
ejected at stool For her casea fairly typical onemy pessary was princi 
pally evolved for surgical interference was emphatically refused Nine weeks 
ago 1 inserted my ordinarysized rtroversion and prolapse pessary In spite 
or my instructions I did not see her again until yesterday when I found the 
following condition of affairs  First there had been perfect comfort in 
bowels and bladder whose functions had been normal  secondly there 
liad been no shirting of instrument andconsequentlyno prolapse 
Nightly in bed she had unfastened the tapes and belt replacing them 
upon rising in the morning  thirdly there had been since a few days 
after the pessary had been in situ absolutely no offensive discharge so 
that she had even considered the daily douche unnecessary  and lastly 
not the least in importance she earned her daily living in perfect 
comfort 
I could quote other cases but to spare your space take 
the above history as a sufficient type If those who give 
my instrument a trial will bear in mind that vaginae vary in 
length and that Messrs Krohne and Sesemann will carry out 
any special instructions as to length of stem etc  they will 
ensure successful application and consequently relief of 
symptoms That my respected old master and friend Dr 
Robert Barnes has inspected my instrument and kindly 
expressed his approval and the opinion 
 
that it is a desirable 
addition to our obstetric armamentum will not I am sure 
lessen its value in the eyes of the profession

BIIXS OF MORTALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA 
The official tables issued during the past year as to casualties 
and deaths from disease in the Field Force in South Africa 
are not easy reading It is of great importance however that 
they should be read and studied and an attempt has therefore 
been made to rearrange and classify the returns published 
weekly or monthly during the past year in such a form that 
their full meaning and magnitude can be easily grasped One 
difficulty in doing this is the variable strength of the army 
for which these returns have been made On February 8th 
loco MrWyndhamthenUnderSecretary for War stated that 
the total of British forces of all kinds in South Africa was 
about 194000 A return issued on December 6th gives 
the total strength on December ist 1900 of noncommissioned 
officers and men only as in round numbers 210000 In the 
first total officers are included but not in the second In 
the following table it has been assumed that the strength of 
noncommissioned officers and men has been throughout 
200000 This assumption will imply that in the early part 
of Table I the deathrate from disease is somewhat under 
stated while in the latter part of the same table it is slightly 
overstated The error however is probably but small and 
Table I and the curve based upon it Fig 1 may be trusted 
as showing at least the general trend of and variation in 
mortality from disease between February 10th and the end 
of December 1900 in the Field Force in South Africa

It will be noted that in Table I the death returns from 
disease are only given from February 10th onwards Before 
that date 514 deaths from disease had occurred in the army 
during the campaign If we assume that the deaths from 
disease during the seven preceding weeks of the year 
occurred at the rate of 50 per week the total of deaths 
from disease during 1900 was 7501 which on an assumed 
strength of 200000 men gives a deathrate from disease of 
yjK per 1000 of strength To these must be added the 
killed in battle and those dying of wounds in South Africa 
not including any invalided home and 200 deaths from 
accident apart from battle and 92 prisoners who have died in 
captivity This gives a total casualty list for the year 1900 
of 4318 noncommissioned officers and men or a casualty

deathrate of 216 per 1000 of the assumed strength The 
apparent proportion between deaths from disease and deaths 
from battle is as 375 to 216 but if we make allowance for the 
number of invalids who have died on the way home or after 
reaching England it is highly probable that the death 
rate from disease has been about twice that from actual 
ing 
e figures as to invaliding deserve passing notice Since 
the commencement of the war 36986 noncommissioned 
officers and men as well as 1638 officers have been sent home 
as invalids or 185 per annum per 1000 of the total force It 
may be urged that as the total strength of the army has been 
maintained approximately at 200000 this statement as well 
as the deathrates already given exaggerate the real facts 
Many more than 200000 men have been in succession fighting 
in South Afriea in the Imperial forces and therefore the pro 
l 
portion of invalids being for a much larger number of men 
will be less than 185 per cent To argue thus is to contra 
vene an elementary point in statistics The deathrates and 
the invalidingrate so far given are annual rates and 
represent the experience for an entire year Assum 
ing the conditions to which they are exposed are 
identical the exposure of 600000 men for onethird 
of a year is only equivalent to the exposure of 200000 for an 
entire year Of the 36916 invalids sent home up to the end 
of 1900 5662 were wounded 30243 were sick and concerning 
1081 it was not specified for which reason they were invalided 
Of the same number 243 had died when the return was 
issued 1570 have been discharged from the service as unfit 
and 654 are in hospital 
The preceding figures have an added significance when they 
are contrasted with the statistics of the army under the con

ditions of peace The last issued annual report of the Army 
Medical Department for 1898 gives the data necessary for 
such a comparison The total deathrate of theField Force 
during 1900 has been approximately 59 per 1000 of strength 
the deathrate from disease alone being 375 per 1000

Unfortunately the available statistics do not enable us to 
state what proportion of the above enormous deathrate from 
disease during the Boer war is due to enteric fever There 
can be no doubt we think that enteric fever bulks largest in 
the returns which have been published Probably the four 
most common causes of death in the field army have been 
enteric fever dysentery respiratory diseases and rheumatic 
fever and probably also the order in which these diseases are 
given is the order of their importance in the death returns It 
is not unlikely that an annual deathrate of at least 10 per 1000 
has been caused by enteric fever alone In one week that 
ending May 26th 1900 the deaths from disease were at a rate 
which if it had been continued throughout the year would have 
killed 94 out of every 1000 soldiers or on the above assumption 
25 out of every 1000 soldiers would have died of enteric fever 
Whether the proportional mortality ascribed to enteric fever 
lias been as heavy as or more or less heavy than here sur 
mised it has undoubtedly been extremely heavy A few 
comparative figures will bring out this point It is to be 
noted that soldiers are at the most susceptible age for enteric 
fever and that new arrivals in countries like India and 
South Africa in which this disease is markedly endemic 
are more susceptible than inhabitants of an older date 
Deathrates from Enteric Fever per 1000 of Population or

South African  188589  137 
  189296  176 
Thus while among the troops in the United Kingdom the 
deathrate from enteric fever is not dissimilar from that of 
the civil population at the same ages the deathrate from 
this disease among the troops in South Africa was excessive 
in the years preceding the Boer war and was about onethird 
to onefourth that among European troops in India The 
problem in South Africa so far as the prevention of enteric 
lever is concerned very closely resembles the same problem 
in India 
Although the preceding figures show that in past years 
enteric fever has been very prevalent among our troops in 
South Africa the experience of last year is altogether excep 
tional Over 200000 men have been subjected to conditions 
which were known to be a fertile cause of enteric fever and 
this experience has been associated with a mortality from 
this disease which is greatly in excesspossibly eight to ten 
times in excessof anything previously experienced in South 
Africa 
That the evils causing enteric fever in South Africa were 
known is shown by a Report on the Prevalence of Enteric Fever 
in Pietermaritzburg by Major R J Simpson MA MB 
which is published in the Report of the Army Medical Depart 
ment for 1898 Appendix No XI p 490 et seq This paper 
embodies a very careful study of enteric fever among the 
troops forming the peace establishment in South Africa and 
particularly among the 1400 soldiers stationed in the capital 
of Natal In this paper Major Simpson shows that 
 
com 
paring two periods of five years each at the beginning and 
end of the period 188496 and excluding epidemic years the 
admission rate per 1000 from enteric fever has increased 
nearly fourfold while the deathrate has increased about one 
seventh 
The sources of this enteric fever were carefully investigated 
It was shown that the surroundings of the water supply of 
the town especially close to the intake warrant the gravest 
suspicion as to its purity On the problem of convection 
of infection by dust Major Simpson has some important 
remarks There is a relationship between deficiency of rain 
fall and prevalence of enteric fever not however through 
dust storms but in association with the rains following 
drought Thus  
In 1890 there was a constant deficiency of rainfall from May to 
November followed by a rainfall in November 2 inches above the 
average The enteric began in December In the seasonal preva 
lence and at least in the occurrence of epidemics the same feature is 
recognisable that a prolonged dry season followed by a heavy rainfall is 
associated with a rapid increase in the number of cases of enteric fever 
In short the disease was chiefly waterborne In October 
1896 a garrison order was published directing that all water 
used for drinking should be boiled and that measures should 
be taken to ensure its use The remark which follows the 
above statement is significant  
It is however one thing to provide boiled water for drinking and 
another to ensure that nothing else is used even in camps There is abun 
dant evidence to show that the men were in the habit of drinking water 
regardless of its source when on route marches field days or walking 
out and as a matter of convenience probably the water nearest to the 
road or track they were pursuing They also habitually drank unboiled 
water from the taps in the ablution rooms 
Assuming however that the water supply could not be 
purified at its source what official is responsible for the con 
tinued supply of impure water to the soldiers at camp at 
Pietermaritzburg although recommendations as to the pro 
vision of filters were made by Major Simpson  
The curve in Fig 1 shows a seasonal maximum at the end 
of May followed by a fall interrupted by a smaller rise in 
September The trend in the last three months is not so 
obvious This may be due to the fact that only monthly 
returns of deaths irom disease have been furnished This 
curve represents all fatal diseases It will be interesting to 
compare it with a curve of the ordinary seasonal incidence of 
enteric fever in South Africa This we are able to furnish by 
again drawing on Major Simpsons paper 
Fig 2Seasonal incidence of enteric fever in Natal Based on 
the dates of admission to hospital of347 cases of enteric fever in 
the years 188897 out of a total strength of 13196 The figures 
for each month indicate the percentage of the total annual cases 
 100 admitted in each month 
JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNE JULY AUG SEP OCT Htv DICl 
It would appear therefore that at Pietermaritzburg and 
probably also in other parts of South Africa the maximum 
seasonal incidence of enteric fever is in December and Januaryr 
after which it gradually declines to a minimum in June 
August Epidemics of enteric fever frequently however 
disturb seasonal curves as the experience of last May Fig 1 
too sadly proves It would greatly relieve the public mind 
to be assured that at this season of maximum incidence of 
enteric fever the army authorities had profited by the experience 
of last year and had grasped and 
grappled with the difficul 
ties of prevention of enteric fever as a practical problem in 
connection with which immediate action is required
