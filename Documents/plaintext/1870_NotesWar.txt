NOTES OF THE WAR 
NO THOROUGHFARE 
THE refusal of the French to allow the wounded in the recent bat 
tles to be transmitted to the hospitals of AixlaChapelle involves 
a difference of three days against three hours transit that is to 
say it signs the deathwarrant of some thousands of their own 
countrymen as well as of their wounded enemies It is true that 
some problematical advantage may be derived from the terrible 
aggravation of mortality and suffering involved in the refusal to allow 
the combatant army to relieve themselves of this load but it must be 
remembered that precisely similar advantages are accorded by the con 
ditions of the treaty of Geneva which allow the combatants on either 
side to leave their wounded within the enemys territory under the pro 
tection of the redcross flag and which neutralise alike the wounded 
the ambulances and the medical officers on both sides and relieve 
the retreating combatants of their encumbrances In the rout of Mac 
Mahons army one hundred and two members of the French medical 
staff were cut off comprising seventyfive surgeons and thirtyseven 
assistants All have been sent back vid Cologne and Belgium over 
this neutral territory No objection has been made nor is likely to 
be made to their travelling by this route The severely wounded are 
now expressly neutralised and we cannot help feeling deep regret that 
they are not allowed to be sent to hospital by the shortest route over 
neutral territory 
ARMY MEDICAL OFFICERS OF NEUTRAL POWERS 
THE refusal of the British Government to allow unemployed army and 
navy medical officers to give their services in the FrancoPrussian war 
is not easily to be explained in the face of the opposite measures agreed 
to at the International Conference last year at Berlin of the opposite 
course now being pursued by other governments as the Russian and 
Swiss and of the interests of English medical science and of English 
soldiers One of the measures agreed upon at the International Con 
ference respecting volunteer aid to wounded soldiers in time of war 
held last year at Berlin was the following  In case of war non 
belligerent powers are invited to place at the disposal of the belligerents 
those surgeons of their army whom they are able to lend without dis 
advantage to their own service such delegated surgeons to be placed 
under the orders of the principal medical officer of the belligerent army 
to which they may be attached The Governments of France and 
North Germany on the opening of the present war both announced 
their intention of accepting and acting upon the resolutions agreed upon 
at the Berlin Congress Accordingly the Federal Government of 
Switzerland as a neutral nonbelligerent power has offered to the 
French and German Governments a number of surgeons of their army 
staff who had volunteered to go Both of the belligerents have accepted 
the offer through their respective ministers at Berne and have ex 
pressed themselves thankful for the assistance The Swiss army sur 
geons destined for France are ordered to report themselves for further 
instructions to the Central Committee of Volunteer Aid to the Wounded 
sitting at Paris those for Germany to the corresponding Committee at 
Berlin We understand that a large number of surgeons of our own 
army desirous not only of helping in the hospitals but also of gaining 
military surgical experience have applied to be allowed to give their 
services in a similar way but their applications have not been acceded 
to notwithstanding that the reason given for no examinations for ad 
mission into the army medical department being held at present is that 
the department is overnumbered Captain W Noble RA Deputy 
DirectorGeneral of Ordnance and Captain Brackenbury R A have 
left Woolwich for the respective seats of war the former for Prussia 
the latter for France to watch the military operations and report to 
the English Government so that the objection to make the necessary 
arrangements for sending medical officers appears all the more un 
accountable 
THE CONVENTION OF GENEVA 
THE advantages secured to the wounded by the Geneva Convention 
are manifesting themselves every day during the present war which is 
the first which has occurred between two Powers both of whom had 
signed the treaty When the war occurred in I866 between Prussia 
and Austria Prussia had signed the treaty but Austria had not Be 
fore the war however had concluded although not until fighting had 
ceased Austria seeing the advantages offered by the Convention 
applied to be admitted as one of the signataries to it an application 
which was at once acceded to One of the principal articles of the 
Convention was the neutralisation of the personnel and the mat6riel of 
the hospitals moving with an army in the fieldof all in short that is 
absolutely necessary for affording the first means of saving the lives or 
lessening the sufferings of the wounded who are placed hors de combat after 
each succeeding engagement One can see the importance of this pro 
vision from the information which reached London on the 20th inst in a 
telegram from Brussels A French field hospital completecomprising 
fifteen surgeons ninety infirmiers eight ambulance vehicles and their 
horseswas captured by the Prussians near Metz and sent on by them 
to Cologne but at the date of the telegram the whole was passing 
through Belgium on its way back to France Before the Geneva Con 
vention all the persons belonging to this hospital establishment would 
have been retained and treated as prisoners of war while the carriages 
and rest of the hospital equipment would have become prize of war 
The military reasons which led the Prussians to send back this French 
military hospital through Belgium instead of returning it across the 
ground on which the Prussian army was manceuvring are sufficiently 
obvious One or two telegrams have referred to field hospitals being 
fired upon contrary to the terms of the Geneva treaty No doubt ex 
planation will be given of these supposed infractions of the Convention  
but it is to be remembered that the Convention particularly provides 
that the neutrality of the field hospitals is to cease if they are placed in 
positions of strategic importance Their neutralisation might be taken 
advantage of to secure important military ends were this provision not 
made indeed no government could have been expected to sign the 
treaty without such an exception being attached to it 
THE WOUNDED IN FRANCE 
OuR correspondence from Paris includes the following items There 
are indications that the grievous official incompetence and obstructive 
ness which have weighed on the efforts of professional and nonpro 
fessional volunteers and subscribers to the aid of the wounded in the 
war is about to come to an end No words can express the grievous 
injury which it has done The inkndancegdnJrale which has blocked 
the way will probably be swept on one side by General TrochuThe 
Faculty of Medicine have just formally placed at the service of the 
Minister of War all their professors agreges and pupils in a body 
The provincial Faculties are taking a similar courseThe Medical 
Dean of the Faculty of Montpellier has abandoned has salary in favour 
of the wounded whilst the war lasts he has added a furcher subscrip 
tion of 500 francs his own services and his Chateau de Grammont 
One thousand seven hundred physicians and students have inscribed 
their names as volunteers at the ValdeGrfaceDr Cunier of the 
First Corps private physician of Marshal MacMahon has been made 
prisoner at Reichshoffen and notwithstanding the neutrality convention 
has not reappeared Other surgeons captured have however been set 
free by the PrussiansThe Aid Society has at short notice esta 
blished a permanent hospital at the Gare de Strasbourg communi 
cating with the station by an inclined plane The wounded are received 
there at once on issuing from the railwaycarriages and either retained 
there or forwarded after their wounds are dressed according to cir 
cumstances 
NOTES OF AN AUSTRIAN SURGEON 
A CORRESPONDENT of the Wiener Medzzinische Wochenschrift writing 
from Heidelberg on the 15th instant at which place he had arrived on 
the previous day in charge of 500 wounded says that Billroth was fully 
employed as principal surgeon at Weissenburg where he had charge of 
a hospital of 500 wounded His assistant Dr Czerny had the care of 
IOO The correspondent says that the difficulties of the medical staff 
are great and manifold The number of wounded scattered in all direc 
tions in Germany must exceed 15000 The French ignore the regula 
tions of the Geneva convention their army surgeons do not wear the 
white band with the red cross and the transport service labours 
clumsily but earnestly and fearlessly to remove the wounded from the 
battlefield even in the midst of showers of bullets After the battle of 
Worth he saw an ambulance waggon overturned on the declivity of a 
mountain and lying under it three wounded menone in articulo mortis 
who had evidently been left on the spot in consequence of the over 
turn and of the flight of the drivers The French he says have made 
no improvement in their ambulances notwithstanding their experience 
in Italy and Mexico they still use for the conveyance of the wounded 
carriages which are dark and unventilated The question of providing 
bedsteads is still unsettled Billroth though a man of great energy 
could not provide beds for his patients in less than eight days The 
Prussian members of the order of St John and their conduct are be 
yond all praise they supplied the writers transportwaggon with all 
pssible necessaries and comforts There is a want of means for the

transport of the wounded from the field of battle and of operators in 
the ambulances after the fight The neutral powers as a rule do not 
appear to trouble themselves about carrying out the resolutions arrived 
at in Berlin last year by sending out army surgeons to the seat of war 
AID TO THE SICK AND WOUNDED 
COLONEL LOYD LINDSAY states that there are now twenty English 
surgeons serving under the Society for giving aid to the sick and 
wounded in equal proportions on the French and German sides The 
Society continues to receive applications for surgeons Eight thousand 
French wounded are in the German Hospitals Dr Mayo who is the 
chief representative of the Society in Germany has gone forward to the 
frontier after having had interviews with the Crown Princess of Prussia 
and Princess Alice of Hesse Chloroform surgical instruments disin 
fectants waterproof goods tourniquets are the leading necessaries 
asked for We suppose that Liebigs extract hydrate of chloral and 
opium may be counted also in the front rank Great supplies of 
charpie and rags have been forwarded The Committee give to each 
surgeon an allowance of Li a day partly to pay their expenses and 
partly to enable them to procure for their patients such comforts as are 
not to be found in a military hospital Dr Frank is the chief repre 
sentative of the Society in Paris three of the surgeons are near Chalons 
two at Metz and two in Paris 
AID TO THE SICK AND WOUNDED 
THE Pharmaceutical 7ournal has appealed to the numerous members 
of the influential Society of which it is the organ to afford assistance in 
kind to the societies for aid of the sick and wounded in the war The 
appeal is timely and wellplaced and we do not doubt that they will 
respond as liberally on this occasion to the appeal from their own 
journal as they did on a former occasionthe heroic war of liberation 
by Garibaldito a private appeal to relieve the necessities of the 
wounded volunteers who fought in the cause of Italian freedom 
Among the drugs most needed will of course be carbolic acid hydrate 
of chloral opium and chloroform but all hospital necessaries will be 
needed in bulk to relieve the dreadful sufferings of the mass of men 
now suffering from wounds or sickness LieutColonel Loyd Lindsay 
has addressed this week a letter to the Pharmaceutical 7ournal thank 
ing it for its appeal and giving a list of articles required as agreed on 
by Dr Sieveking and Mr Pollock 
DRESS OF SURGEONS AND DRESSERS 
SEVERAL instances on both sides are reported in which surgeons and 
dressers have been fired upon and killed It is suggested perhaps 
with reason that this is due to the difficulty of distimguishing them from 
many combatants from whom they differ but little in uniform It is 
recommended that  surgeons hospital attendants and ambulance men 
should be dressed in some unmilitary uniform of a conspicuous colour 
say for instance the bright yellow formerly worn in the Spanish army 
a colour no longer worn in any army in Europe The idea seems 
good although the colour will probably not be approved Modest 
men however steeled by scientific carelessness of costume would feel 
uncomfortable nowadays in a canarycoloured dress and a more sober 
means of distinguishing them might easily be selected In time of war 
indeed extraordinary expedients are suggested but regimental sur 
geons walking about the streets in yellow coats would probably know 
no peace This Spanish uniform is at present worn we believe by one 
division of the ragbrigade who would possibly join the gutterboys 
generally in resenting the arbitrary adoption of this colour by the Army 
Medical Department 
MATERIAL RATHER THAN MONEY 
IT seems incredible says the Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift but 
from all quarters especially the German hospitals and ambulances the 
complaint reaches us of want of material for dressing the wounded and 
for treating and supporting the sick It would almost seem as if 
governments and war ministers took care for the provision of the means 
of destroying wounding and maiming and treated charpie com 
presses and surgical aid as quite of secondary value And if this want 
is apparent at the commencement of a war what must it become after 
weeks or months It is almost the exception for the aidsocieties to 
send to the belligerent powers material and not money Money has 
been liberally supplied for the wounded but of what use is it if it is 
impossible to buy medicines charpie bandages wine and other neces 
saries on the spot where they are wanted The Austrian patriotic 
helpunion has turned its attention in the first place and chiefly to the 
sending of material both to the French and to the German armies  
from both sides it has received the warmest expressions of gratitude 
and requests for further aid of the same kind It would only be a 
matter of simple humanity if other societies would apply themselves 
more to the sending of material than of money 
ACTION OF THE ITALIAN AIDCOMMITTEES 
THE Italian Committees for aiding the sick and wounded in war have 
placed themselves in communication with the central office at Basle 
Those of Padua and Milan have forwarded to that place supplies of 
every kind Arrangements for doing the same tliing at Florence are 
being made and the Turin Committee has provided ambulances and 
placed them at the disposal of the central committee whose instruc 
tions as to their destination are expected 
DR MOSETIG formerly assistant of Baron von Dumreicher will pro 
bably go to the seat of war in France as a delegate from the Austrian 
Society for mutual help 
THE Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift learns with deep regret that 
the Austrian foreign ministry has declared it inopportune to comply 
with the proposal of the ministry of war to allow military surgeons to 
be sent to Prussia and France and placed at the disposal of each power 
for service in the military hospitals 
DR MAYO one of the medical men whom we last week mentioned as 
having been sent by the National Aid Society to Germany has 
telegraphed from DarmstadtHave seen Princess Alice Am going 
forthwith with party towards Metz Instruments much needed pro 
bably surgeons Send cases of instruments tourniquets and 201b of 
chloroform to me here Mark  Immediate with large red cross 
Pray continue to give us your aid 
MR SIMONS NEW REPORT 
THE Twelfth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Coun 
cil will be shortly in the hands of the profession It is one of consider 
able interest and importance It deals with the recent epidemics of re 
lapsing fever and scarlatina the dryearth system of treating nightsoil 
and the midden and its allied systems used in some northern towns the 
watersupply the use of milk of diseased cows the transmission of dis 
ease by vaccination animal vaccination as practised on the continent 
the Pharmacy Act and other subjects 
In respect to relapsing fever though there have been cases in other 
parts of the country the reporter confines himself to giving an account 
of the metropolitan epidemic He observes that it is a disease almost 
unknown in England but as far back as the middle of i868 there were 
precursory symptoms of such an epidemic It was not till the autumn 
of I869 that it became an accomplished fact Mr Simon calls atten 
tion to the memorandum to which we referred at the time for the 
guiidance of local authorities and gives the following short account of 
the epidemic 
The admissions of relapsing fever in the London Fever Hospital in 
October had numbered 130 in November they were 259 in December 
315 Here perhaps strictly speaking my statements on the subject 
ought to cease as my report formally relates only to the business of 
i869 but probably I shall be excused for adding the more satisfactory 
experience of the first three months of I870 After Christmas the dis 
ease increased in the district of Holborn with Clerkenwell and in the 
parish of St Saviours Southwark and appears to have attained at the 
beginning of the year its chief extension over the poorer parts of 
London In January the cases of relapsing fever admitted into the 
London Fever Hospital were 258 in February the London Fever 
Hospital together with the newly opened Hampstead Hospital re 
ceived I53 cases only in March they received I40 At the present 
date March 3Ist I870 the two hospitals contain 103 cases of relapsing 
fever the disease is on the wane and the months of winter during 
which such infections are particularly apt to spread among the poor 
have happily now passed with comparatively a trifling epidemic 
The mortality was very low out of 769 cases treated in I869 in the 
London Fever Hospital only 17 werefatal 
Reference is then made to the Diseases Prevention Act of 1865 and 
to the working of the Metropolitan Asylums Act of 1867 and Mr 
Simon says of the former that though it has only been passed fifteen 
years it had even in a crisis such as that of i869 to be treated as
