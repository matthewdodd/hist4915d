THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE MOOI RIVER GENERAL HOSPITAL 
From Our Special War Correspondent 
The Site of the Hospital 
No 4 General Hospital stationed close to the Mooi River sta 
tion on the Natal Government Railway main line and known 
generally as the Mooi River Hospital merits a detailed notice 
for it reflects infinite credit on the R AMC and on all con 
cerned  on those who selected the site on those who laboured 
hard to utilise it to the best advantage on those who are 
entrusted with the management and on the medical staff 
who work together with an 
esprit 
de corps not invariably found 
in large military base hospitals However stereotyped the 
pattern each hospitalwhen once it has got into full working 
swing develops an individuality and this quality undoubt 
edly affects the standard of the work done No 4 has one 
great advantage due to its position It is not near any town 
or even village There are a few camps scattered about in the 
vicinity The cavalry depot is situated on the left bank of 
the river a mile away The campa small oneof the scouts 
is seen in the distance and close to this in a commanding 
position on the strong crest overlooking a flat wellwatered 
plain on which a great herd of cattle grazes peacefully a de 
tachment of the Naval Brigade watch unceasingly for an 
enemy now mercifully never likely to show themselves 
again as such in the vicinity Viewed through the clear air 
the kopjes where the Boer guns were stationed when they 
helled the station seem but a short distance away A thriving 
farm nestles under the slope of a hill a mile or two away 
bedded in a dark patch of trees relieved by the brighter green 
of the mealie fields around it For the most part the country 
is quite bare of trees but here and there on the crests of the 
hills dark fringes show The country is really a great upland 
over 4 000 feet above the sea level The beauty lies in the 
magnificent sweeping curves of the hills and possibly to some 
extent in the fact that the bracing air predisposes one to ad 
mire everything No better station could have been found for 
a hospital and indeed the place is known as a health resort 
A couple of miles away is the Lake Hotel known to invalids 
situated in the minute village of Weston and looking down 
the valleytealong which the river winds 
The Officers Hospital 
The principal hotel close to the railway station has been 
taken over entirely and converted into a hospital for officers 
It is well adapted for the purpose having a large verandah or 
 
stoep running round three sides of the building Most of 
the officers are accommodated in separate rooms an arrange 
ment that seems to be preferred though the reason is rather 
hard to understand These bedrooms are small and most of 
them of an uncompromising cubical shape that suggests rather 
a prison cell than a sick room The isolation is complete if 
the occupant has any complaint that confines him to bed and 
at Mooi River visitors are few and far between a condition of 
affairs which may increase the monotony of convalescence in 
some cases but undeniably tends to the smooth working of 
the hospital even if it be not an actual advantage to the 
patients The officers no doubt feel the deprivation of com 
munication with the outside world but the men in camp un 
gracious as it may be to hint even at the fact appear to be 
perfectly satisfied with their own society and profoundly in 
different as to whether they are visited or not People do not 
always realise how absorbing and engrossing an occupation is 
the contemplation of ones own convalescence 
The main diningroom is fitted up as a general ward with 
about a dozen beds As in all buildings not primarily de 
signed for hospitals the ventilation arrangements are less 
thorough than might be desired So long as the warm 
weather continues and windows and doors can be kept con 
tinually open there is nothing to complain of But the 
winter is fast approaching and the cold at Mooi River can be 
very severe Some difficulty is likely then to be experienced 
throughout the building in securing an adequate supply of 
fresh air without draught and without risk of chill This 
after all is a problem in hospital construction that is still 
not solved to everyones satisfaction in places where the 
architect and the sanitary officer have a free hand to devise 
the most perfect arrangements that can be secured The 
sanitary arrangements of the hotel are now good though the 
amount of work done at the outset in this direction before the 
sanitary condition was considered satisfactory must have 
rather surprised the proprietors of the hotel 
The ground immediately surrounding the hospital required 
extensive clearing for in this as in so many of the hotels 
and dwellings in South Africa the immediate entourage was 
more than untidy Kaffir servants can hardly be expected to 
realise the necessity of living not only in a clean house but 
with clean surroundings Sufficient care is not taken to im 
press this on them They are such intelligent willing and 
cheerful servants that the fault clearly lies with the masters 
rather than with the subordinates The alterations sweep 
ings and cleanings effected by the RAMC before the place 
was held fit for the reception of patients must have astounded 
and it is to be hoped also instructed them 
There is no doubt that the bold step of 
 
commandeering 
 
the hotel has been thoroughly justified In the case of 
officers tent life in hospital is unsuitable on many grounds 
For the men however whenever the climate will allow of it 
tent hospitals appear to be the ideal arrangement on active 
service 
Cooking 
In the important but often rather neglected detail of cook 
ing the arrangements appear satisfactory This essential 
department of a hospital has probably during the present 
campaign occasioned the authorities as much trouble and 
worry as any other of administration and it must be ad 
mitted that the difficulty has not always been satisfactorily 
met Sick cookery is an art that but few possess and in 
valids are critical to the point of captiousness in many cases 
Even offers of large salaries have failed to tempt competent 
chefs and the dearth of cooks of even moderate ability has 
been a serious trial No Principal Medical Officer can ever 
feel entirely confident in the smooth working of the hospital 
under his charge unless this essential detail has been satisfac 
factorily provided for It is the one department in which 
everyone is qualified to give an opinion It is unfortunate 
that in our country the disposition to learn the art of cooking 
and the talent for exercising that art appears to be confined 
to women The importance of this subsidiary branch of army 
organisation does not appear to have received the same 
amount of consideration in our own country as it has in Conti 
nental nations 
The Hospital Camp 
From the Mooi Eiver station to the hospital camp is about 
three quarters of a mile the ground on the right bank of the 
river rising in a gentle slope A thoroughly good road has 
been made and a wide wellconstructed wooden bridge 
thrown across the river The discomfort of transit from the 
station is thus reduced to a minimum and a high embank 
ment renders the gradient of the road down to the river very 
gradual so that the wheeled stretcher carriages are easily 
conveyed to the hospital 
The Hospital Trains 
While on the subject of the conveyance of patients from the 
front it may not be out of place here to make brief 
reference to the hospital trains on the Natal Govern 
ment Railway At the time of my visit there were 
two such trains both of which had been converted 
for the purpose Although extreme ingenuity had 
been shown in making the very best of the materials 
at hand it must be admitted that the trains fell far 
short of the standard attained in Cape Colony and also it 
would appear in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State 
The cardinal difficulty that could not be overcome was that 
the corridor carriage is not in use on this line and no corridor 
carriages of course that might have been converted could be 
brought round from Cape Colony by rail as a glance at a 
map of the railway system will show Even at a station 
where there is a suitable platform the entraining of a stretcher 
case was attended with some inconvenience and even risk to 
the patient Where no platform existed the difficulty was of 
course much enhanced It is true that in other of our hospital 
trains this drawback has not been fully recognised I was 
informed by Major Daly EAMC whose almost unique

experience in this war gave him full opportunity 
of seeing the arrangements made for the care of 
the sick and wounded on the Boer side that in his 
opinion the Boer ambulance trains were superior to our own 
In particular he praised the ingenious arrangement whereby 
patients could be easily entrained out in the open A sloping 
way adapted at will to the position of the train could be let 
down and the stretcher bearers were able without difficulty 
and without alarming the patient to carry their burden into 
the carriage The device resembled apparently the method 
adopted in England for horseboxes These trains were it is 
alleged bought in Germany a striking example if true of 
the completeness of the preparations thought necessary for 
purely defensive purposes The worst feature of the separate 
compartment arrangement is of course that so long as the 
train is moving the patients are inaccessible to the medical 
officer 
The Princess Christian train now it is understood in 
process of being fitted together for use in Natal will remedy a 
very serious defect in the arrangements and there is no doubt 
that it is more needed in Natal than in the western sphere of 
operations 
The Plan of the Hospital 
No onenot even a civilian who is supposed to have no eye 
for such matterscould fail to be struck by the workman 
like order in which the general hospital was set out and with 
the rigid mathematical precision of the lines The diagonal 
lines of the marquees were as absolutely true as the longi 
tudinal or transverse a feature that furnished at once evidence 
of the complete and careful attention to detail of every kind 
which characterised the hospital throughout 
I was informed that no positive instructions existed as to 
the precise plan on which a general hospital was to be laid 
out a rather striking example that demaximis non curat always 
the War Department Colonel Clery the PMO of the hos 
pital and Major Lucas RAMC taking advantage of the lati 
tude thus provided had to devise to a great extent their own 
arrangements of marquees and had certainly succeeded very ad 
mirably in the general design Some 89 marquees were in use 
as hospital wards at the time of my visit The space available 
allowed of an almost indefinite increase without in anyway 
altering the plan of the hospital 
The central row was devoted purely to administration 
Building was going on actively and in the centre of the ad 
ministrative block a large erection of wood and galvanised iron 
was nearly completed This was to be used as a reading and 
recreation room 
Close by was the operating theatre which was opened for 
use during my stay The theatre was of wood and galvanised 
iron with floors of concrete slightly sloping to one corner so 
as to allow of free flushing of the floor The lighting was ex 
cellent top lights being placed in the sloping parts of the 
roof The operations that the military surgeon maybe called 
in to perform may be of the most difficult nature and it is 
cruel to compel him to work as is the case too often in the 
hospitals here under conditions of semidarkness Practi 
cally there were two theatres divided by a partition with a 
wide door The second room was used when there was no 
great pressure of work in the theatre as an anaesthetising 
room 
Attached to the same building was the rray room The 
mains supplying current for this room furnished also electric 
light to the operating theatrean enormous boon and an 
advantage that one did not expect to meet with in a hospital 
practically so remote The accumulator battery was at the 
railway station in trucks These had to be sent down to 
Maritzburgto be charged 
The Medical and Surgical Divisions 
Wide alley ways separated the medical division and the 
surgical division respectively from the central administrative 
j 
block In too many of the military hospitals sufficient care 
did not seem to be taken to keep the medical and surgical 
cases apart This necessary precaution was difficult or im 
possible to observe no doubt when large numbers of patients 
were aggregated together and public buildings were utilei 
as hospitals  but the plan of mixing up the different cases 
was very objectionable and when many cases of enteric or 
dysentery were under treatment or bad septic cases were 
present positively dangerous At Mooi river the distinction 
was very thoroughly observed from the first Thus the 
medical officers were not as is the case in some hospitals 
called upon to treat cases of every kind at once but were 
kept very properly and very much to their own and the 
patients benefit to a particular line of practice 
Separation of Surgical Cases 
The principle of segregation was carried still further Septic 
cases were on the surgical sidekept apart as much as possible 
The cases of spinal injury were left by themselves as requiring 
special care and attention Venereal cases were lodged in a 
separate camp altogether some distance from the main hos 
pital and entirely distinct from it Most of the marquees 
contained six beds but at the upper end of the hospital where 
the slighter cases were lodged there were eight beds the regu 
lation number 
The Bedsteads 
It may be noted that for the most part the bedsteads were 
too wide and with eight in a tent little room is left If the 
camp is pitched on rising ground it is impossible as a rule to 
arrange the beds so that all shall slope in a convenient direc 
tion and wide bedsteads have really to be packed in rather 
without regard to the comfort of the patient lying in them 
The difficulty of moving or lifting a patient on a wide bed 
stead is much greater than on a narrow one and when the 
case is one of fracture particularly when the fracture is of the 
femur the sagging of the wirewove frame constitutes a serious 
objection and one prejudicial to the patient A great variety 
of frame is found in the different hospitals It would seem 
desirable to adopt a regulation pattern of a more convenient 
height than the majority of those in use here and of a regu 
lation width that would allow more space in the tent while 
contributing to the patients advantage and comfort 
Sanitary Arrangements 
The sanitation of the camp was all that could bedesired 
and the precautions especially that were not only enjoined 
but rigidly enforced in dealing with the dejecta in the enteric 
and dysenteric cases were admirable Rules and written 
regulations however complete and minute are useless with 
out constant personal supervision Orderliesand nurses 
too for that matterare but human and in their anxiety to 
observe the actual letter of the law often strangely err in 
understanding its spirit An incinerator at some little 
distance from the hospital provided for the prompt destruc 
tion of soiled dressings etc 
The Water Supply 
The water supply was taken direct from the river which 
here flows with a fairly rapid stream A small donkey engine 
pumped the water up into a tank raised on a scaffolding above 
the level of the highest point of the camp This tank was 
circular and made of galvanised iron a contrivance that has 
been found of the utmost value Such tanks are light easily 
moved by rolling and readily cleaned The water was run 
off from this reservoir through a sand and gravel filtering bed 
and then into the boilers for thorough sterilisation before it 
was distributed to the camp Thus treated the water could 
be readily further filtered through the Berkefeld filters 
Unless water be delivered in a fairly pure state into these 
I filters it is almost out of the question to secure due observ 
ance of the regulations with regard to the use of the Berkefeld 
filter If there is any sediment in the water the candle of the 
filter becomes clogged and the process is then so slow and 
laborious as to render it almost useless That the filter is an 
extremely efficient one all agree but in active servicejn a hot 
climate its employment is perpetually evaded 
Laundry 
Both the medical and surgical wards were most thoroughly 
equipped Laundry difficulties which in a wet climate are 
much more formidable than might be imagined had been 
efficiently provided for 
Milk and Eggs 
The supply of fresh milk left something to be desired and 
indeed this has been a great difficulty throughout in the 
Natal hospitals Ideal milk was in great request and 


774 mSLSSSiJTHE 
WYNBERG 
HOSPITALSMaroh 31 190a 
many of the men asked for this in preference to the fresh 
milk which had to be boiled before it was served out The 
time of delivery of the milk which had to travel far was 
necessarily rather uncertain and in an uncertain climate 
like that of Natal there was also a liability to the whole stock 
being delivered in a sour state Eggs too were scarce and 
fetched a high price 
Comforts and Luxuries 
The small luxuries and comforts which count for so much 
in the mind of the public when it turns its attention to hos 
pitals were provided in abundance Of tobacco too there 
was an ample supply The openair method of treatment 
which the climate permits and which has been so widely and 
wisely adopted in the military hospitals allows of free use of 
tobacco in wards without annoyance to nonsmokers Tobacco 
has a very real value in the treatment of such cases as abound 
in military hospitals in time of war A full supply of tobacco 
for smoking in whatever form it might be preferred would in 
the field hospitals and dressing stations be second only in 
value to morphine and would very often most advantageously 
replace it Men waiting their turn to be dressed after they 
are brought down from the fighting line often positively crave 
for tobacco and it acts as a most efficient and harmless ano 
dyne A box of cigars or cigarettes would often give as much 
relief as the hypodermic syringe and fit a man far better to 
stand a rough journey from the dressing station into the field 
or stationary hospital The value of tobacco is recognised 
bat still not recognised enough 
The Nursing Sisters 
At the time of my visit there were only nine nursing sisters 
at work in the hospital Nursing in the sense it is ordinarily 
understood was therefore practically out of the question A 
general superintendence was really all that the sisters could 
rovidevaluable 
beyond question but still of necessity so 
imited that its value was reduced to the smallest compass If 
the principle is recognised of having nurses in hospitals at all 
a sufficient number should be provided to enable real nursing 
to be carried out It was in contemplation to erect imme 
diately marquees for 200 more patients in anticipation of the 
relief of Lady smith making some 800 beds in all But it 
seemed by no means certain that additional nurses would be 
forthcoming 
The Organisers 
I have given only a 
very imperfect sketch of what appeared 
to me reviewing the hospital with an absolutely unprejudiced 
eye as a very perfect organisation Only a few weeks ago the 
site was practically a hayfield covered with wiry grass 
through which one had to wade in wet weather knee deep 
Now by dint of hard work and energy controlled by judicious 
foresight and directed into the proper channels by chiefs who 
possessed a real gift of organisation the field is converted 
into a village and this village is one of the most efficient and 
wellmanaged hospitals I have hitherto met with The 
natural advantages of site remoteness from habitations 
proximity to the railway etc have been utilised to the fullest 
and the net result ie one of which the PMO Colonel Clery 
RAMC may well be proud No commanding officer could 
well be more fortunate in his staff and the share that Major 
Lucas RAMC has taken in providing for the efficiency of 
the hospital is acknowledged by all

THE WYNBERG HOSPITALS 
By Sir William Thomson 
Chief Surgeon Irish Hospital South Africa 
Capetown March 6th 1900 
We have been unable to move to Naauwpoort owing to the 
block on the railway With a single line it is difficult to 
carry up reinforcements and at the same time to bring down 
nearly 5000 Boer prisoners But we are promised an early 
transit to the junction which is near the Free State border 
and on the road to Bloemfontein The hospital there is full 
and help is badly needed so that we hope to 
 
lend a hand 
 
there very soon 
T wq qnxinuH tr pav a second visit to Wynberg as some 
xainloads of wounded had come down from Paardeberg They 
had suffered much before they reached the train For three 
days many of them had travelled in ox waggons exposed to 
the heavy drenching rains of that region but once the 
luxurious hospital train was reached they travelled the 600 
miles to Wynberg with all comfort 
In No 1 Hospital I met Colonel Greer who conducted me 
through several wards and I saw several men whom I had 
visited before 
There were many nenr wounded Boers but although they 
had arrived in a rather dilapidated condition the5 were now 
clean and cheerful In one ward Boers and our own wounded 
were mixed They are on excellent visiting terms but the 
political question when it is broached sometimes interrupts 
this cordiality The prisoners are treated precisely as our 
own men They are indeed on parole now and although 
there are the usual guards the Boers who are able can leave 
the wards and move about the beautiful shady groves which 
are part of this delightful spot or receive their visitors in the 
wards I asked several how they were treated The first said  
We could not be better treated in a firstclass hotel Others 
bore like testimony I asked if they got enough to eat and 
they testified that they were very well treated in this respect  
They could get anything They were all well dressed in 
clothes provided by the hospital authorities A father and his 
son were amongst them I asked their name Thompson 
said the boy and he told me that his father was born in 
England and coming out at an early age was now a burgher 
of the Free State 
I went to see No 2 Hospital which is under the charge of 
Colonel Duke It is accommodated in tents I was glad to 
find an old resident pupil of my ownMajor Lougheedin 
charge of the surgical side The tents are large marquees of 
the usual size There are boarded floors and beside every bed 
is a small shelfed table The sheets and bedding were 
scrupulously clean and the patients were clothed in sleeping 
suits with which they had been provided on reaching the 
train I was particularly struck by the fine healthy appear 
ance of those who were not suffering from severe wounds 
There were English Scotch and Irish and a few Canadians 
all fine stalwart fellows One of the latter had five bullet 
woundsnone of them serious He enjoyed his preeminence 
The Highlanders were recognisable by the colour of their legs 
The knee and a little above and below were sunburnt almost 
quite black  and one or two men told me that their bare legs 
suffered a good deal from the fierce sun on the veld 
I spoke to a Highlander who had come down from Paarde 
berg with a bullet wound of the ankle It was not serious and 
I refer to him only in connection with a curious coincidence 
He was in hospital a couple of months ago with a wound in the 
same foot He recovered and went to the front N c w he found 
himself back again in the same tent in the same bed and with 
another wound in he same foot 
Major Lougheed showed me a young fellow who had a bad 
brain wound 
I Perforating Bullet Wound of Brain  Hemiplegia  Trephining  Becoveiy 
The bullet entered on the left side from before backwards ploughed 
through the motor area and passed out There was paralysis of the right 
side Both entrance and exit openings were enlarged by the trephine 
and fragments of buried bone extracted The paralysis disappeared 
There had been a little suppuration anteriorly but I found the patient 
doing well He had practically no symptoms 
In this division seven or eight gunshot wounds of the head 
required trephining and only one case which developed 
abscess has been lost 
The compound fractures of the thigh form an interesting 
group In all those cases where the injury to the shaft is done 
by highvelocity bullets the comminution is very severe  
sometimes the loss of substance is so great that union appears 
almost hopeless  yet when the loose fragments have been 
removed the results are excellent Of a group of 30 admitted 
to No 2 Hospital amputation has been necessary in only one 
case Extension by weights is practised and the shortening 
is slight 
Bullet Wound of Pharynx  RecoveryOne man of the East Kent received 
a bullet wound just below the base of the skull on the right side about an 
inch and a half behind the mastoid process The bullet passed under th 
base pierced the pharynx and soft palate carried away the first two upper 
molars on the left side and escaped This wound was received at Paarde 
berg on February 18th just 16 days ago The wounds were entirely 
healed and the man was walking about the grounds 
The penetrating bullet wounds of the thorax are numerous 
I but are all doing well In several of them there is hsemo

thorax and it is necessary occasionally to aspirate or to open 
the chest wall deliberately to relieve dyspnoea  but all the 
cases do excellently well 
The mortalityrate of the wounded brought here is quite 
remarkable Out of 970 bulletwound cases of all sorts only 5 
have died a record which is a high testimony not only to 
excellent surgery but to the pains taken from the first to 
ecure the safety and comfort of the wounded 
This camp is well laid out and its general arrangements are 
quite good Colonel Duke and his assistants have paid 
special attention to sanitation The earth closet is used and 
all ward refuse dressings etc are burned The water from 
the wash houses goes into absorption tanks and trenches The 
tents are large and airy with clean wooden floors The bed 
ding is as good as could be desired and I know from personal 
inquiry that the men have no complaints to make as to their 
treatment in hospital Indeed speaking generally in no war 
hitherto waged has so much attention been given to the care 
of the wounded nor have the recoveries from wounds been so 
extraordinary 
n I am anxious to make known the result of my visit to this 
great military hospital because before I left home a ridicu 
lous article appeared in Le Matin associating me with an 
an official duty that of reforming the hospitals in South 
Africa Indeed the writer said there werft really none to re 
form as they did not exist Of course this reference to me 
was absolutely without a particle of foundation It is of a 
part with the information and intelligence which combine 
monthly in addressing a leading French medical journal to 
me at Dublin Ecosse  I have only been a casual visitor and 
I can say that while I think there are parts of the system in 
which improvements may be made the exhibition of efficient 
working at Wynberg is one of which the medical department 
of ary country might well be proud 
NOTES ON THE BASE HOSPITALS IN CAPE 
COLONY 
From our Special Correspondent in Capetown 
March 7th 1900 
The Wounded from Lord Robertss Force 
The work at the base continues to be more or less of a routine 
character There is very little of surgical interest The cases 
from the actions at Belmont Modder River and Magersfon 
tein have now mostly passed into the convalescent stage and 
only the slighter cases from the actions fought by Lord 
Roberts and General French have been sent down here With 
the departure of our troops from the railway the despatch of 
wounded almost straight from the battlefield to the base has 
been discontinued This is obviously a wise course to pursue 
as the fatigue of a couple of days journey by road would be 
very detrimental to seriously wounded men Lord Robertss 
next forward move will probably bring him into possession 
of the railway either at Bloemfontein or some point to the 
southward thereof and then within easy reach of the basehospi 
tals or of the General Hospital No 6 which has been established 
at Naauwpoort and in that case the original pi an of prompt 
despatch of wounded to a general hospital will probably be 
reverted to Indeed it is rumoured that as soon as we are in 
full possession of Bloemfontein and the country to the south 
ward thereof No 3 General and the Portland will be moved 
up to the Free State capital In favour of this course is the 
fact that in a few weeks the rains which are already begin 
ning will render the Cape peninsula a very undesirable loca 
ton for hospitals under canvas This consideration will 
apply more strongly to No 3 and the Portland than to any 
other of the general hospitals as Rondebosch is particularly 
damp arid the site being on a dead flat will be liable to be 
swamped As No 1 consists of huts and is on an easily 
drained slope it may last very well through the winter 
months One may be certain that Colonel Supple the base 
Principal Medical Officer who thoroughly understands local 
conditions will appraise all these considerations at their proper 
value So far very few serious surgical cases have been sent 
even to No 6 which is principally filled with more or less 
convalescent patients from the Colesberg force and with 
cases of enteric fever I understand that there were an im 
mense number of cases of enteric fever in Ladysmith which 
might be expected Even under normal c editions the dis 
ease is rife in Natal at this time of year and one can easily 
account for a marked increase in a coopedup garrison devoid 
of the ordinary conveniences of life There have been a large 
number of cases on the Eastern frontier in the forces under 
Gatacre and Brabant The base station hospital at Wood 
stock is getting its full share mostly from the cavalry camp 
at Mai tland and from the Australian transports 
The South African Type of Typhoid Fever 
Typhoid fever here differs materially from the form usual 
in England and approximates more nearly to the Indian type 
The classical textbook typhoid is hardly ever seen here and 
diagnosis especially in the early stages is very difficult A 
practitioner of very large experience assures me that he does 
not see a rash in more than one out of five or six cases in civil 
practice although as I mentioned last week the medical 
officer in charge of the enteric wards at Woodstock sees a 
larger proportion amongst the soldiers This is interesting as 
it may be due to the type being an imported one Then again 
it is extremely rare to find the temperature chart typical The 
temperature4 hardly ever goes either up or down in the orthodox 
manner and defervescence is very irregular and marked by a 
much closer approximation of the morning and evening 
register than is usual in Europe Marked diarrhoea again 
is less frequent and the characteristic tongue is seldom met 
with Diarrhoea when it is present often appears only at 
a late period perhaps for the first time in the third or even 
the fourth week and gurgling and abdominal tenderness are 
frequently absent Indeed it may be said that a large num 
ber of enteric cases present nothing but pyrexia and the con 
ditions which accompany any pyrexia And yet many of these 
simple pyrexial cases are fatal presenting typical lesions at 
the necropsy The writer saw many such during the Kaffir 
and Zulu wars when the disease was extremely rife  The 
fever is very often extremely prolonged without any compli 
cations and assumes very often an intermittent type Car 
diac failure is a frequent cause of death and most experienced 
practitioners guard against it very carefully from the begin 
ning One cannot help thinking that there is something in 
the typhomalarial theory after all Curiously enough there 
do not seem to be very many cases of enteric amongst the 
Boer prisoners from Cronjes force What cases there are are 
being mostly taken to Wynberg Several cases of measles 
have already appeared but although occurring in adults do 
not seem to be severe All the infectious cases amongst the 
prisoners are sent to Woodstock 
The Hospital at Woodstock 
This hospital which is nowunder the immediate eye of Colonel 
Supple being got into excellent order needs a few more nurs s 
to make it complete and these will be installed as soon as 
quarters are ready for their reception I saw a very interest 
ing necropsy there the other day  
The subject was a case of phthisis with a mass of old consolidation at 
the right apex a large ramifying vmica occupying most of the upper part 
of the right lung and disseminated tubercle almost all over the rest of the 
same lung The interesting point was that the vmica had penetrated the 
pulmonary pleura formed an adhesion with the costal pleura and per 
forated the chest wall in the second interspace forming an abscess about 
the size of a pigeons egg in the axilla looking exactly like a suppurating 
gland There was no general pleurisy whatever on that side The patient 
had only been out about six weeks and had been sent from a transport 
with the diagnosis of pneumonia 
This patient was either a militiaman or a reservist I forget 
which but a moderately careful physical examination ought 
to have precluded him from being sent out at all 
Some Surgical Cases 
Dr Simon of the Station Hospital related to me the other 
day particulars of a curious surgical injury 
The subject had been struck by the cowcatcher of an engine in the back 
but not run over The sacrum had been smashed and pushed to the 
right and the adjoining parts of the left ilium comminuted so as to leave 
a large gap exposing almost the whole length of the rectum He had also 
sustained a gutter fracture of the skull with resulting intracranial 
haemorrhage and this was apparently the cause of death For some reason 
or other the head Injury had been left alone 
At the Portland Hospital I saw a rather curious head injury 
the other day under the care of Mr Wallace 
Depressed Gutter Fractures of SkullA bullet had ploughed along the 
vertex near the tep of the Rolandic fissure and had depressed the outer 
table in an absolutely vertical manner without a trace of splintering the 
inner table forming the floor There is an almost exactly similar case 
in No 3 Hospital except that in the latter the bullet had separate entrance 
and exit wounds in the scalp whereas in the former it had ploughed up 
the soft tissues as it went Both cases had done absolutely well 


77 mSLSai SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE March 31 1900 
There are a good many wounds of bone showing how largely 
softnosed bullets are being used by the Boers One of these 
showed a small ordinary Mauser entrance wound at the back 
of the thigh with a ragged exit in front about 2 inches in 
diameter the femur being comminuted extensively Many 
fragments of bone have come away This is a type of many 
similar cases They are now being put up in Hodgens 
splints and both Mr Bowl by and Mr Wallace accord un 
stinted praise to that ancient but very effective appliance 
Good results are almost uniformly attained even in these 
cases of extensive bone destruction The gaps fill up appa 
rently with new bone Mr Wallace thinks that many of the 
fragments retain their periosteum and act as so many bone 
grafts He consequently leaves as many as possible in situ 
Judging from some specimens of bullets in the possession of 
the writer the ingenious Boer finding that the ordinary 
Mauser fails in full stopping power improves upon it by cut 
ting off the nose and then making four longitudinal grooves 
along the mantling A small turning machine for doing this 
work is I am told carried with the commandos The use of 
this machine must apparently be left to individual predilec 
tion for many of the ordinary Mauser clean wounds are met 
with 
Another case I saw at the Portland Hospital under the cre 
of Dr Howard H Tooth was a very interesting instance of 
nerve lesions 
Injury of the Brachial PlexusA bullet had entered in front of the 
shoulder just to the outer side of the coracoid process and had emerged 
immediately to the right of the fifth dorsal vertebra There was more or 
less paresis and impaired sensation of the whole arm but according to 
Dr Tooth not complete paralysis of any one muscle leading to the 
inference that one or the cords of the brachial plexus had been bruised 
but not actually divided 
Colonial Nurses 
A recent critic of the authorities on the score of failure to 
encourage colonial nursing talent may now possess his soul 
in peace Ten nurses were sent to Natal last week and four 
to Orange River  this is in addition to many engaged for the 
transports and some for the hospitals It may be safely said 
that no nurse with satisfactory credentials has gone without 
an engagement 
Colonial Surgeons 
Colonial surgeons are freely available and are being em 
ployed as far as possible although the supply is still some 
what in excess of the demand The station hospital at Wood 
stock is now with the exception of the administrative 
officers entirely worked by a staff of these gentlemen 
Very many of them are also at work at the up country 
hospitals 
Commissions for Civilian Surgeons  
This war has been productive of many startling departures 
from established military usage Let me suggest another 
with a view to filling the depleted ranks of the R AMC Let 
the authorities offer commissions without examination to 
a certain number of the Volunteer and civil surgeons who 
have done satisfactory work  and I feel certain that the offer 
would in a large number of cases be gladly accepted to the 
advantage of the service Many of these gentlemen have got 
very fairly into the minutiae of military detail and have got 
so fond of military work that they would even face a moderate 
pecuniary sacrifice to have the opportunity of going on with 
it more especially if some of the older men were allowed to 
commence as captains a concession which I do not think the 
RAMC officers would resent if it were only made in really 
deserving cases In this connection I feel bound to note the 
excellent good feeling which seems to exist between the 
regular officers and the civilians There is no evidence of one 
iota of jealousy A combatant officer high in rank said to me 
the other day that nothing could be better than the granting 
of commissions to some of the civilians and made the remark 
which I simply quote without endorsing that there would be 
far less friction between the combatants and the surgeons if 
the latter did not enter the service till they had been toned 
down by eight or ten years of civil life starting when they did 
enteras captains or majors 
The PMOs with Lord Roberts and on the Lines 
of Communication 
Colonel Stevenson is away up country acting as PMO 
with Lord Robertss force and during his absence Colonel 
Supple is acting as PMO of the Lines in addition to his 
other duties The burden of responsibility on this very 
energetic and capable officer must be very great Base 
duties alone are I suppose far heavier than they have ever 
been in any British campaign not only because of the 
magnitude of the force engaged but because almost all this 
force has been landed at the one base and owing to the 
geographical and climatic conditions geneial hospitals have 
had to be concentrated here instead of being located some 
where on the lines of communication as ordinarily would be 
the case The base jurisdiction reaches as far as Stellen 
bosch and within the area covered are three general hos 
pitals the Portland the big station hospital now run up to 
420 bedsthe camp hospitals at Green Point and Maitland 
and several subsidiary institutions most of which have had 
to be more or less improved Added to this the base PMO 
has to manage all details of embarkation and disembarka 
tion make medical provision for all the Boer prisoners 
engage civil surgeons and nurses see after the equipment 
of new bearer companies and do a thousand other things 
largely through machinery which requiresas all improvised 
machinery doesconstant supervision How much the 
country owes to the energetic officer upon whom has fallen 
the main burden and heat of the day will probably only be 
found out at the close of the war He has been ably helped 
by his painstaking Secretary Major OConnor with whom in 
my journalistic capacity I have come a good deal into con 
tact but one hardly can understand how he will be able to 
supervise another office 
New Hospital at Green Point 
The military authorities have taken the newly erected Cor 
poration Infectious Hospital at Green Point and are raising 
it by the aid of auxiliary buildings to an establishment of 300 
beds It will take the place of the present camp hospital 
and will be partly dieted and partly nondieted The venereal 
wards will come under the latter establishment This new 
hospital will relieve the overtaxed Woodstock establishment 
Some 60 cases of venereal diseases are I understand to be 
transferred at once 
Augmentation of General Hospitals 
Equipment for an additional 100 beds drawn from the 
stores of the defunct No 5 has been sent out to No 3 I 
understand that it is likely that the other general hospitals 
will be raised beyond the regulation establishment As this 
economises personnel it is perhaps preferable to mobilising 
more hospitals 
WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE 
From an OccasionalCorrespondent 
Water Supply 
This is one of the chief difficulties at the present moment 
Under the most favourable circumstances good water is far 
from abundant in South Natal Wells may be said not to 
exist and drinking water has to be obtained from streams 
and rivers which are scattered at long intervals apart The 
past season has been one of exceptional drought so that many 
of the streams are at present dried up Thus the water has 
frequently to be taken from stagnant pools which are often 
the colour of weak chocolate The supply of wood in Natal is 
so limited that to boil the drinking water is out of question 
Fortunately each unit is liberally supplied with Berkefeld 
filters and when properly used these are found eminently 
satisfactory They have however certain drawbacks The 
cylinders are so brittle that they require the most careful 
handling They clog so quickly that they have to be removect 
and brushed every two or three minutes The process of 
filtration is so slow that few have patience to continue it day 
by day When however the filter is properly and carefully 
used it is perhaps the best we at present possess 
Bations 
Fresh meat and vegetables are issued when available On 
the whole their quality has been excellent The bread sup 
plied has been particularly good vastly superior in every way 
to that which is supplied to the troops in England where the 
ration bread is so often heavy sodden and indigestible 
When fresh rations cannot be obtained biscuits and tinned 
meats are issued These have been of excellent quality and 


March 3 
900MEDICAL 
ASPECTS OF THE 
WARUSSjgg 
777 
many officers and men prefer them to fresh rations Lime 
juice is also issued but only when the troops are in receipt 
of tinned provisions It is however to be regretted that the 
regulations do not permit more latitude to the Army Service 
Corps and allow them to take a leaf out of the enemys book 
The Boer brings his cattle along with himr and at the same 
time makes them carry supplies of biscuits and dried rations 
Fresh meat is therefore always available for him whilst at 
the same time he gets rid of much of the long line of bag 
gage waggons which so hamper the movements of British 
troops 
Clothing 
Khaki is of course worn by all ranks In addition each 
soldier has a great coat and the usual grey flannel shirt 
When going into battle however he is so loaded with ammu 
nition that the great coat has to be left behind For many 
nights in succession therefore as happened for instance at 
the battle of Spion Kop he may have to sleep without either 
great coat or blanket In spite of this the troops have kept 
wonderfully healthy 
Field Hospitals 
At the time of writing there are with the South Natal Field 
Force eight field hospitals namely six with infantry brigades 
and two with corps troops Each field hospital is provided 
with its own transport Originally this consisted of two mule 
waggons two ox waggons and two water carts The mule 
waggons have been withdrawn from most of the hospital as 
they were required for the use of mounted corps and addi 
tional ox waggons have been issued instead Each ox waggon is 
provided with sixteen to eighteen oxen and is capable of 
carrying easily from 4000 to 6ooo lbs As the total weight of 
the field hospital equipment including tents is in round 
numbers about 12000 lbs it will be seen that the waggons are 
not overloaded They are therefore able to move quickly and 
can keep pace with any even mounted troops By order of 
the PMO Colonel T J Gallwey CB RAMC each hos 
pital carries in addition to its ordinary equipment a large 
reserve of medical comforts so as to be prepared for all even 
tualities an excellent anangement which has been found to 
work admirably as the hospitals are now more or less inde 
pendent of the supply column and may be separated from it 
for days without risk of breaking down According to the 
Field Service Manual 1899 the equipment of afield hospital is 
two medical companions two surgical haversacks two field 
medical panniers one reserve field medical pannier one field 
surgical pannier one field fracture box and one antiseptic 
case By order of Colonel Gallwey each hospital has been 
allowed to draw one additional fracture box and three addi 
tional antiseptic cases With these additions the equipment 
is practically perfect Without them the hospitals would 
have been quite unable to cope with the large numbers of 
wounded they have had to deal with since the commencement 
of the war Each hospital also carries a large surplus stock of 
blankets and waterproof sheets which have added greatly to 
the comfort of the sick and wounded Charitable societies 
both here and in England have sent supplies of underclothing 
etc which were found invaluable as the kits of many of the 
wounded were so damaged by the time they reached the field 
hospitals as to be practically useless The articles which were 
found by far the most useful were pyjamas flannel shirts and 
cardigan jackets 
THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
We are indebted for the following account of the establish 
ment of this hospital to Mr Alfred Fripp MS FRCS 
Chief Surgeon  
Deelfontein 29 miles south of De Aar 
March 5th 1900 
Deelfontein is the site selected for the Imperial Yeomanry 
Hospital and is the most northerly at present safe in fact had 
we been two days later in leaving Capetown we should not 
have been allowed with our 40 nurses to come so far up for 
the region around has broken out in rebellion and a band of 
2000 to 3000 are looting It is not thought however that 
they will do any serious fighting We met all Lord Robertss 
Boer prisoners going down to Capetown3700 whites and 
some 400 blacks under the charge of Lord rroll The rail 
way line from Capetown 471 miles is very hardworked and 
we were very fortunate to get away actually within one hour 
of the first moment that our force was completed by the 
arrival of the Majestic with our 17 other doctors and 10 sur 
gical dressers Colonel Sloggett EAMCour Principal 
Medical Officerand I and 100 men had arrived three days 
earlier on the Norman 
Deelfontein is an excellent site for a hospital but a lonely 
spot However with our 520 beds and 180 to 200 personnel 
1 co blacks and our guard of 50 volunteers it will soon cease 
to be lonely We face east and have a lovely view of hills 
mostly tabletopped many miles distant over rolling plains 
of karoocovered ground At our back is a long kopje some 
three or four hundred feet high which shuts out the prevail 
ing wind Ostrich farms two of 13000 acres each come up to 
our land and flocks of sheep and goats which fatten exceed 
ingly on the poorlooking karoo plant are in the neighbour 
hood There are no trees anywheje in this country for hun 
dreds of miles except at the older towns and in river beds 
both of which are insanitary But we have a clump of willows 
which just give relief to the eye and will bepopular with our 
patients It is very hot now both day and night but in a 
month it will be very cold at night and in June and July it 
is no uncommon thing for an inch of ice to form in the tank 
on the railway from which our water supply is drawn But it 
is always warm during the day 
The water which has been fully analysed with the best 
results is pumped up from a well We shall sink a second 
well as a standby Unlike De Aar it is not very dusty here 
and the karoo is greener than in most parts travelled through 
coming from Capetown The railway line is guarded strongly 
by troops all the wayespecially at the bridgesand in view 
of the rebels I mentioned the guard has been increased We 
only arrived here this morning100 personnel 19 doctors and 
10 dressers and much baggage and between 8 am and 8 pm 
a wilderness of store cases was transformed into a camp It 
was very hot and very hard work but the 50 volunteers who 
form our guard erected a huge marquee so that we messed 40 
in it at 8 pm  everybody down to the cooks who cooked in 
all three square meals the first thing we did was to purchase 
and slaughter a bullock and two sheep worked magnificently 
and the result is that an iron and wood hut has been erected 
and all the stores put into it Six tortoise tents have been 
put up for the officers and sufficient bell tents for the men 
and we shall all sleep under cover and the officers even on 
beds Latrines have been dug Blankets and washing and 
cooking and eating utensils and tables and chairs have been 
served out Every man has his allotted task to perform until 
the hospital is open We are hurrying on because the wounded 
and sick are many and the other base hospitals are pretty full 
Most of our wards will be hutscorrugated iron outside 
wood inside with generally felt between for as I said before 
the winter is coming on 
All our 40 nurses will be housed in similar huts The nurses 
and their 10 maids are due in the Guelph in less than a week 
It is a journey of 26 hours in the mail train and as only four 
can travel in each compartment they will fill up three long 
bogies and we shall have some difficulty in securing so 
much accommodation We hope to have the nurses here and 
the hospital open by March 14th which will be nine weeks 
only since the active work to float the hospital was begun in 
London 
The feeding and timing arrangements along the railway are 
a little uncertain but really the railway has borne the brunt 
of this war as well as any department involvedwith perhaps 
the sole exception of the EAMC whose achievements are 
almost beyond criticism I have been over all the hospitals 
at Wynberg and Rondebosch and one of the hospital trains 
and I can only say that I am filled with admiration 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
By a South African Campaigner 
XIX 
It is gratifying to observe that the deathrate from disease in 
the forces in South Africa has been considerably lower than 
that which occurred among the American army in Cuba In 
both instances typhoid has been the most virulent enemy to 
the soldier The remedy which I have persistently advo 
cated as the one reliable measure against typhoid is that

which was found the most effectual through this campaign 
simple boiling of the water Water boiled in South Africa can 
very readily be cooled to an almost icecold temperature by 
being buspended in canvas water bags or feltlined water 
bottles in the open air The dry ness of the atmosphere pro 
duces evaporation so rapidly from the surface of the canvas 
bag or the saturated felt lining of the bottle that the temper 
ature of the water is rapidly lowered 
The Siege op Kimberley 
An interesting letter from Mrs Maguireto the Times refers 
to the unusual prevalence of typhoid during the siege which 
was inevitable from the insanitary conditions arising The 
scurvy which we were informed by heliograph two months 
ago was prevalent in Kimberley was as 1 suggested at the 
time almost confined to the natives Lack of milk was un 
doubtedly one of the chief causes of the high infant mor 
tality The deaths from different causes towards the end of 
the siege appear to have averaged about 200 a week 
Feats of Medical Men during the Campaign 
When the war is over there is little doubt that a volume of 
the greatest interest might be compiled dealing with the 
services and adventures of medical men during the cam 
paign The experience of Dr Mackenzie one of the best 
known professional men in Durban Natal is of interest At 
the time the war broke out he was returning from Europe 
with his family after a holiday trip On landing at Durban he 
found that war was in progress and that the Natal Carbineers 
in which he held a commission as Major was already at the 
front In twentyfour hours after landing he had left 
Durban to join his regiment One of the most brilliant 
feats performed by the Carbineersand indeed by any 
body of men throughout the campaign in Natalwas the 
interception of a body of 300 Boers retreating into the Free 
State by a squadron of some 120 men in command of Major 
Mackenzie The colonists in this squadron having detected 
the line which the Boer force proposed to take galloped for an 
hour under cover of the hills of Natal and formed an ambus 
cade on the line which the Bor force was taking On the 
arrival of the Boers Mackenzies force took them completely 
by surpris killing and wounding a considerable number 
capturing prisoners and putting the rest to flight This bril 
liant performance may perhaps be cited in support of the view 
that the training of a surgeon by no means disqualifies a man 
as a soldier Dr Davies of Johannesburg has served 
throughout with the Imperial Light Horsp having twice been 
taken prisoner by the Boers Dr Arthur Fuller of Kimberley 
who was so unfortunate as to lose his only infant son in a 
railway accident which occurred at the time when trains were 
crowded with refugees had travelled to Capetown before the 
siege of Kimberley began The siege having commenced it 
seemed impossible for him to get back to his friends and his 
duties in the beleagured city nevertheless he succeeded 
after the battle of Magersfontein in getting through the Boer 
line and joining his friends at Kimberley
