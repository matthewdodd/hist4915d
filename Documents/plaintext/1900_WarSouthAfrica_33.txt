THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
IN PRETORIA 
By Sir William Thomson 
SurgeoninChief Irish Hospital Field Force South Africa 
The Town the Camp and Enteric Fever 
Pretoria June 2Jth 
The difficulty of getting through any letter to or from 
Pretoria suggests that we are in a degree invested by the 
nemy True he is a good way from us in the south and in 
the north Botha has been driven off 40 miles after two sharp 
engagements But De Wet has adopted the course which was 
obvious  he did not need the prompting of our generous Con 
tinental friends and has assailed telegraph and railway lines 
in our rear with some success Letters and telegrams do reach 
home we believe but only by using messengers to carry them 
to a place of safety Letters for us however do not come I 
have had none of later date than April 20th and anxiety is 
naturally great We believe that somewhere south 1200 mail 
bags are awaiting safe conveyance to the frontbut rumour 
now has it that they have been captured and burnt by De 
Wet 
Pretoria is full of interest to us all Our entry to it was 
through suburban brickfields and inches deep of red powder 
that shaped into clouds at the smallest breath But as we 
advanced we entered long straight wide roads always 
running at right angles to each other edged with houses of 
varying architecture and size Some were pretty houses 
many elaborate villa residences of red brick and stucco 
faced and planted by trees among which the fruitladen 
orange was conspicuous As we neared the central square we 
entered the limited region of shops Many of them were 
really immense stores like those at home most of them well 
fitted and all of them lighted by electricity The square it 
self is made impressive by the two great buildingsthe 
Raadzaal or Parliament House facing the new but unoccu 
pied Palace of Justice They are both worthy of the home 
metropolis and the Boer officials certainly know how to make 
offices splendid and luxurious In the middle of the square 
nd therefore spoiling the effect stands an old Dutch Re 
formed church but it was purchased by the late Government 
ior removal At one end of this stands the beautiful pedestal 
for the Kruger monument the scaffolding still around it but 
the effigy although finished absent  and already the vacant 
epace has been assigned to a statue of Her Majesty It is 
also suggested that Lord Robertss statue should 
occupy the opposite end Banks and insurance offices 
or hotels more or less handsome make the sides 
and give a certain European air to the place 
Then in the daytime the whirling dust is controlled by 
watering carts At night the streets blaze with electric 
lights But the ordinary civil population is absent Many 
hops are closed altogether but not one is barricaded as they 
were at Johannesburg Tommy walks abroad unarmed as if 
he were in a garrison town at home  officers throng into the 
hotels to get a square meal after a biscuit ration The only 
Boers to be seen are in the crowd at the Raadzaal where they 
push in like a mob at an early door to deliver up their 
rifles and take the oath of neutrality Sometimes this has 
been varied by fifty or sixty prisoners taken at some fight 
These do not go free  but for the rest when they have got 
their pass they join the ordinary street passengers and lose 
any special identity for us as fighting men Only a week ago 
they were firing on us  now the bandolier and rifle are put 
Aside and the Boers are ordinary people fraternising with us 
discussing the campaign telling their adventures criticising 
their own Generals and ours but always expressing admira 
tion of the splendid bravery of the British soldier 
Such is Pretoria today under a second British occupation 
Just nineteen years ago when we retired from it the square 
over which two palaces now hold guard was covered with 
waving veld grass and the paved pathways were represented 
by a couple of foot tracks 
We camped on Wednesday June 6th with the nth Division 
near the famous racecourse where our prisoners were confined 
and the next night we knew of the release of about 3000 of 
them at Waterval Many of them looked ill and worn but 
their delight at hearing our guns and seeing their old com 
rades may be imagined Of their hardships in illness and in 
health they speak openly Stories flit about which may take 
form later on but it would be unjust to mention names until 
there is substantial proof of charges On Friday we moved 
out with the troops for about nine miles and on Saturday re 
turned to our ground nearer town The ambulances carried 
back thirty patients and later in the afternoon we received 
seventy more But the field equipment which we had brought 
was adapted to fifty only All we could do was to give up six 
small living tents provided for the company and thus we 
were able to give cover to the second fifty but these men had 
to lie on the ground wrapped in blankets Nearly half were 
enteric cases and it is easy to realise what this meant There 
was no provision for them in the town The Volks Hospital 
was full and a model school was already crammed  other hos 
pitals on the field were as we were except that all their 
patients had to lie without stretcher and on mattresseswhile 
we were able to give these small comforts to fifty As always 
happens once the troops sat down sickness made itself mani 
fest and there were i 000 cases or more demanding treatment 
and proper housing 
The Evolution of the Irish Field Hospital 
I had looked for some days at the stately exterior of the 
Palace of Justice and wondered what was inside I learned 
that it had just been finished at a cost of 18000o but that it 
had never been occupied A casual conversation with Major 
the Hon R White led to an introduction to General Maxwell 
the Military Governor who had visited the place Next day 
the Pretoria Medical Commission was formed consisting of 
Mr Murray Guthrie MP Mr Leigh Wood distinguished 
for his splendid services in helping our sick prisoners at 
Waterval Mr Heys and Mr Loveday member of the Raad 
The Governor asked me to act as adviser and to be a member 
of the Commission of wnich Mr Wood was made chairman 
We became a local Red Cross Society and by the energy of 
Mr Wood and Mr Guthrie an enormous quantity of material 
was collected in twentyfour hours and we at once began to 
distribute bedding etc to the various hospitals and we took 
over the Palace on Friday June 15th as a perfectly bare 
building A hospital committee was formed and I was 
asked to undertake the medical direction with the usual pro 
viso as to recognition of military supervision and control 
a proposal which was at once sanctioned by Lord Roberts 
Mr Rupert Guinness was also appointed a member 
On Tuesday June 19th I moved in with 80 patients 
who were provided with wirewoven beds white sheets 
and the little luxuries that were so keenly appre 
ciated by men whose only bed for six months has been 
the hard veld and whose only tenting was the sky Electric 
lighting had to be introduced kitchens and latrines con 
structed and stores laid in It was downright hard work for 
I had as helpers only Dr Coleman Mr Douglas Thomson 
dresser Mr Lurring apothecary and five orderlies sur 
vivors of the march and these with Mr Murray Guthrie 
and Mr Wood worked with untiring energy To them I owe 
more thanks than words can convey 
Today we have 260 patients in the hospital the only addi 
tion to my staff being some untrained orderlies The greater 
number of the cases are enteric fever and several of these 
have died within a few hours of admission They have been 
in field hospitals under conditions that were inimical to their 
recovery 
I The Palace of Justice is a building of fine proportions and 
would be quite worthy of a place in any metropolis It has a 
i frontage of about 200 feet and a depth of nearly 250 The 
central hall is 145 feet by 45 floored with encaustic tiles and 
I surrounded by a balcony supported by 60 massive stone pillars 
the bases and cornices of polished metal The central dome 
is lofty and ornate The sides and front of the building are 
three storeys high and the rooms number about ico Beneath 
in the basement there is excellent storage 
I Four of the principal wards have been named after Lord 
Roberts the Military Governor General Maxwell Lord 
Kitchener and Lord Iveaghwhose staff for the Irish Hospital 
has been for the time domiciled in the Palace of Justice 
I The difficulty which was the first to be dealt with was the 
disposal of excreta The method here is to have nightsoil

removed by carts and buried I determined to have it 
burned For this purpose it is mixed with coal ashes and 
sawdust removed and fed into a furnace so that with a 
preliminary free treatment with disinfectants the best is 
done under the circumstances 
The remainder of my staff at Bloemfontein has been tele 
graphed for by the CommanderinChief and when it arrives 
we shall be able to deal with 400 or 500 patients But transit 
at present is very uncertain Trains are still being fired into 
and contents blown up An officer whom I met yesterday had 
been seven days on the journey Today however things 
look better 
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE MEDICAL 
ARRANGEMENTS 
From otjr Special Correspondent at Capetown 
July 3rd 1900 
The Opening of the Campaign 
The main topic of interest at present is of course the sweep 
ing attacks on army medical administration which under 
the leadership of Mrs Dick Chamberlain have been made on 
this side concurrently w ith Mr BurdettCouttss campaign 
in England The first move here was a contributed article 
from an irregular from one of the Colonies who is stated to 
be a man of education and of high position in his own 
country published by the Cape Times far and away the most 
influential of South African newspapers For this article by 
not inserting it in the correspondence columns the Cape 
Times of course assumed a measure of responsibility and it 
necessarily attracted much attention It evoked a whole 
shoal of letters nearly all in defence of the department 
Closely following upon this the Archbishop of Capetown 
a very highly respected prelate distinguished for the 
moderation of his views in most matters made a speech 
at the Good Hope Society roundly accusing the medical 
authorities not only of general neglect but of keeping back 
from patients comforts sent by the Society In particular he 
mentioned the camp at Rosebank where there is some sort of 
a  
hospital 
 
devoid of the simplest comforts and he went so 
far as to say that tbe medical officer there was unfit for his 
office The Rev G G McLure a Presbyterian minister substantiated the general charge of neglect and went on to 
say that what had been said of Rosebank was equally true of 
Green Point and Maitland Some further complainants have 
extended the attack to Wynberg and Rondebosch but Wood 
stock was not specifically mentioned until yesterday when 
Mrs Dick Chamberlain who is I know the prime organiser 
of the whole criticism wrote to the Cape Times a very 
trenchant letter indeed in which she designates both No 1 
and Woodstock as dirty and insanitary swarming with 
filthy insects and 
 
destitute even of necessities except 
those contributed by the public The same issue con 
tains a letter signed by 33 convalescents at Rosebank protest 
ing against the reflections on their medical officer stating that 
their wants had now been attended to and then going on to state that their real grievance lies in the direction of 
not being able to get their pay a matter with which the 
medical world has of course no concern It should be men 
tioned that the Archbishop has written to Dr Klein the 
Rosebank Medical Officer apologising unreservedly for his 
aspersions upon him and that this letter has been published 
The Archbishop however still maintains that someone has 
been to blame in connection with Rosebank Two corre 
spondents write defending Naauwpoort and Deelfontein re 
spectively and the Cape Times prints a halfhearted subleader 
admitting that the complaints may represent an exceptional 
experience but still damning the military medical officer 
with faint praise by insisting that heroism in the field does 
not make up for roughness or unsympathetic treatment of 
patients elsewhere 
The Allegations Examined 
Now I purposely abstained from writing to you on this 
painful subject last week from the fear of being led into an ex 
firte 
statement without the opportunity of personal inquiry 
have now carefully looked into the matter from all sides 
and shall endeavour to give the result of my conclusions for 
what they are worth These conclusions are arrived at from 
the point of view of a civilian medical practitioner holding 
no brief for the Army Medical Service but who can add to 
twenty years practice in the Colony the experience of an old 
campaigner that of an administrator of a civil hospital and 
that of a correspondent whose duty has brought him into 
daily contact with the hospitals at the base since the beginning 
of the war 
Alleged Deficiencies in Diets 
Briefly then my humble opinion is that whilst the medical 
machinery has failed in some places to save the men from dis 
comfort and perhaps in a few has involved them in a measure 
of injury the gross allegation of wilful neglect of mala fides and 
of culpable incompetency can easily be disproved Some of 
them indeed disprove themselves Take the worst allegation of 
them all contained in the Colonial Volunteers 
 
Seamy Side 
article that a sergeant in charge of his field hospital and other 
orderlies systematically refused to supply actually routine 
articles of diet without payment at an exorbitant rate and 
that this was allowed to go on systematically Common sense 
alone is sufficient utterly to pulverise such a statement as this 
There were according to the complainant 26 men in the tent 
To assume that every single man of those 26 was prepared to 
keep silence under treatment of this kind especially when 
accentuated by such trifles as the kicking of a patient with 
dysentery is to assume the absurd Tommy is not given to 
possessing his soul in peace when he has a grievance and 
your average free and independent Colonial even less so 
Complaint is all the easier from the fact that it is of a nature 
so easily substantiated The diet sheet can be read by every 
patient so that he knows what he is entitled to and a failure 
to supply the items therein named is a common grievance to 
which the whole tent would certify I have invariably found 
that the soldier scrutinises his diet sheet most carefully and 
never fails to bring to the notice of his medical officer the 
slightest discrepancy between it and his supplies But it is 
alleged that complaint can be stifled by the simple process of a 
sergeant bending over the bed of a man who is beginning a 
disclosure to his medical officer and terrorising him into 
silence by 
 
insulting and obscene 
 
threats This suggestion 
is grotesque seeing that medical officers RAMC and civi 
alike have the usual allowance of perceptive faculty Then 
again as to the stifling of legitimate complaint what becomes 
of the orderly MO of the camp or garrison orderly officer of 
the PMO of the chaplain and all the other heterogeneous 
mass of visitors official and nonofficial P Could none of them 
listen P The experience of everyone of our civil surgeons is 
that the slightest defect quantitative and qualitative is 
promptly brought to the notice of the orderly MO whose 
special province it is to elicit complaints Further the mens 
own medical officers are by no means always accompanied by 
war dm as ter s or orderlies Apart from their ordinary 
rounds they constantly look into the wards at odd 
times and on such occasion a private complaint is 
always possible And there is this further considera 
tion that by far the major share of the actual attendance 
upon the sick is in the hands of civil surgeons both at the 
base and at the front These gentlemen are neither better 
nor worse than the generality of practitioners  indeed the 
Volunteer admits that they are  
shining lights of the ser 
vice 
 
if so the service is so permeated by them that its dark 
ness cannot be so great and they at least are not trammelled 
by the assumed baleful service traditions of brutality and 
incompetence Consequently if brutality and neglect are so 
rampant as we are told the profession as a whole must plead 
guilty to charges not often levelled against it But are the 
RAMC officers so easily persuaded to leave behind them 
the traditions of the most humane of callings  I do not 
think so The most careful investigation has only brought to 
my notice one instance of harsh language or action on the 
part of an officer in that corps during this war This was in 
defensible I admit but occasional black sheep may be found 
in any body of men The point of the critics on this side at 
least is that the whole system is honeycombed with the 
faults complained of No one can deny that the best 
of systems has its weak points nor that individual 
evildoers are found everywhere Unfairness consists in 
holding up the blaek sheep as types of the flock What 
I maintain is that the military hospital system with

ARRANGEMETgmwouSLi 251 
its neverending checks and counterchecks often complained 
of as wearisome is as perfect a human machine for checking 
peculation and neglect as one can at present devise Your 
average civil surgeon complains that it is only too minute 
At Rosebank Camp 
Now as to the more specific charges The pity of it is 
that they are so few The Archbishop had heard this 
and had been told that but he only nailed ene charge 
to the counter namely that convalescents at Rosebank 
had neither had blankets nor beds What are the facts P 
At Rosebank Camp there is no hospital whatever nor 
is one intended This camp is the base depot of the 
South African Irregular Forces suchas the South Africa Light 
Horse Robertss Horse etc These forcea were in the first in 
stance raised and equipped by private effort mostly by a few 
wealthy Johannesburgers A committee of these gentlemen 
did all the recruiting made all the arrangements and subject 
of course to the approval of the Imperial military authorities 
appointed the officers amongst others Dr Klein the present 
medical officer at the camp a German practitioner well known 
for his kindliness and ability The committee secured the 
Agricultural Show ground as a bape depot at which recruits 
were and are kept until fit for the front Later on of course it 
received men about to be discharged men temporarily sent 
down to Capetown with prisoners or the like and men dis 
charged from hospital pending their rejoining their squadrons 
or being discharged from them To examine recruits and to 
attend to medical needs of the depot Dr Klein was kept but 
it must be distinctly understood that he was merely to render 
temporary aidas a regimental surgeon every thing beyond the 
slightest ailment being sent to a general hospital after being 
examined by him Consequently no hospital accommodation 
was provided nor needed Except as regards the actual per 
sonnel of Dr Klein the place did not come apart from sanita 
tion under the purview of the RAMC at all But quite 
recently owing mainly to the delay of the pay people at 
Rosebank in settling with and dissharging the men the 
number of convalescents has increased and as some of 
them were still weakly Dr Klein felt that they needed some 
thing better in the way of bedding than the ordinary trooper 
fit for service and he repeatedly requisitioned the Command 
ing Officer of the depot to that effect After a time nothing 
being done or apparently likely to be done he appealed to his 
medical chiefs not because they were responsible for the sup 
plies for they were not but simply to back him up Colonel 
McJS amara promptly inspected and concurred with Dr Klein 
in considering beds etc necessary and requested the Com 
manding Officer to provide them resting satisfied with the ex 
pectation that this would be done Dr Klein was equally 
satisfied but the Commanding Officer did nothing and thus 
the state of things undoubtedly wrong came about and it was 
only remedied eventually by the Medical Department supply 
ing the things required clothing and bedding for which it 
was not responsible Surely it is too much to expect the 
RAMC to follow men up to their own units and perform the 
functions of a regimental commissariat 
Charges of Callousness 
Then Mr McClure and others have roundly said that the 
citizens of Capetown are sending waggon loads of comforts for 
the sick and that the medical officers or someone else pre 
vent their getting them Mrs Dick Chamberlain is even 
more emphatic According to her 
 
So determined are the 
doctors not to allow the outside public so callous are they to 
the sufferings of the unfortunate patients that men have to 
lie on the floor and suffer all kinds of things Now again for 
the facts The PMOs of the hospitals have again and 
again appealed for various things constantly gratefully 
acknowledge them to the minutest detail in the papers and 
what is of the most importance forthwith hand everything 
received to the Superintendent Nursing Sister who keeps 
them under lock and key and distributes them entirely at 
her own discretion subject only of course to the dietetic 
direction of the medical officers in charge of the cases Surely 
no one can assert that any better almoners than our devoted 
nursing sisters could be found 
 
Maitland Yeomanry Gamp 
 Now as to the charges of neglect at the Maitland Yeomanry 
Camp The explanation I gave as to the position of Rosebank 
apply in great measure to this It is not recognised as a 
hospital or convalescent home In order to meet 
ordinary everyday requirements and for sanitary purposes 
the Yf omanry Hospital was asked to detail a medical officer 
to do duty at the McKenzies Farm Yeomanry Base Camp but it was distinctly ordered by the SurgeonGeneral that 
every case of illness in the least serious should be sent to a 
general hospital The SurgeonGeneral has from the begin 
ning been opposed to small subsidiary hospitals and I think 
rightly Unfortunately it appears that the medical officer at 
McKenzies Farm took upon himself to treat some cases of 
enteric fever there and two died It is certainly not proved 
that these men died from any neglect  indeed the utmost 
that an indignant lady critic whom I interviewed on the sub 
ject could urge was that there was no nursing sister there 
They were housed in a comfortable hut and received quite as 
good attention as nine out of ten enteric patients get in civil life but still it is unfortunate that they 
were dealt with at a place never destined for the purpose but 
for this the PMO can hardly be held responsible There is 
a little difficulty in getting at the exact position of the 
medical officer at McKenziesthat is as to whether the 
PMO of the Base or the Yeomanry Hospital people are his 
immediate superiors Of course in the broad sense all 
medical arrangements are under the SurgeonGeneral but 
there is no going behind the fact that in the case of all the 
outside hospitals there is a certain delegation of responsibility 
to the bodies forming them Indeed if it were not so the 
benevolent organisers would be the first to kick It is only 
fair to mention that the Yeomanry people distinctly state that 
they disclaimed from the first any responsibility for the 
management of the Maitland Hospital Be this as it may it 
is rather unfair to expect the military authorities to exercise 
the same constant supervision over an institution distinctly 
instructed to regard itself as a mere  
detention hospital as 
over a recognised place for the continuous treatment of the 
sick This consideration carries still more weight when the 
institution has some sort of an individuality apart from the 
military system properly so called for reasons which I have 
just mentioned I have very good reason to believe that this 
individuality was at the bottom of the retention of the enteric 
patients at Maitland Whether the esprit de corps dwelt in 
the medical officer in charge or in the yeomen patients I am 
not prepared to say but I do know that from the adjoining 
cavalry camp at Maitland proper even very slight cases are 
very promptly despatched to Woodstock or Wynberg 
Food Supplies 
Another assertion made by the Volunteer contributor of the 
Cape Times is that even at Wynberg a man cannot get sufficient 
food without paying for it that instead of the dietary pound 
of meat they only get 8 ozsM and that the allowance of butter 
is absolutely insufficient Now these assertions I am in a 
position to deny categorically both from my own intimate 
acquaintance with Wynberg Rondeboscb and Woodstock and 
from the testimony of several men Colonial friends OLe or 
two relations of my own who have been in thete institutions 
and can be relied upon to speak quite unreservedly I am 
quite certain that the meat supply is absolutely up to weight 
except on rare occasions which without peculation must 
happen when large quantities have to be hurriedly divided 
I know of several instances in which complaints have been 
made of short weight and in all these cases except one the 
complaint was shown by actual weighing to be groundless 
So far from wardmasters or orderlies being inclined to aid and 
abet the cooks in peculation I have always found that these 
people are rather inclined to regard one another as natural 
enemies and that the average ward mast er rejoices in catching 
the cookhouse people tripping Again as to the butter It 
must be admitted that in some of the diets the ounce allowed 
is not quite sufficient but practically whenever asked for an 
additional ounce very often two come in as extras I have 
before me notes of 48 diet sheets taken from four wards and 
an annex without any selection From these I have eliminated 
14 cases in which for strictly medical reasons the diet is 
limited The remaining 34 are on roast varied stewed steak 
roast chop stewed chicken and minced chicken In every 
sheet except one either stout whisky cr pert wine appears

HOSPITALJuly 28 1900 
in six of them two bottles of stout daily The one exception 
is a professed total abstainer who earnestly pleaded not to be 
given stimulants 
In all the cases but 6 and 4 of these are on varied an 
additional ounce of butter is ordered and in 17 of them 2 
ounces In addition on all of these sheets except the 
 
varied 
 
diets some other 
 
extra 
 
appearseggs porridge 
jelly custard rice pudding or the like I have no hesitation 
in saying that your middleclass patient in Capetown say the 
average shopkeeper bank official civil servant or the like 
the man with an income of 300 to 500 per annum literally 
cannot afford to give himself during convalescence so liberal 
a diet as Tommy Atkins is ordered in hospital This may 
seem a strong assertion to make but it is the result of a con 
sensus of opinion from myself and two civil practitioners who 
have large goodclass practices in this city It may of course 
be said that the patient does not get what is ordered To 
that I can only repeat that unless a patient is a helpless 
idiot and his medical officer hopelessly incompetent a con 
tinued and systematic course of tampering with diets is 
impossible 
Hospitals at Wynberg 
Mrs Dick Chamberlains letter is written in a spirit widely 
different from the criticisms of the Archbishop Mrs Hanbury 
Williams and some others The former reaches the hard 
ships of the sick and wounded by way of a personal grievance 
always a bad introduction to an indictment Apropos of 
that personal grievance I may relate a little anecdote In 
the early days of the campaign I happened to be in a ward in 
one of the base hospitals A lady whom I did not then know 
was talking to a patient whom I was anxious to see After a 
respectful wait on my part she passed on The first words of 
the patient were I hopes you frightened her away sir I 
dessay shes an orf ul good lady in her way  but if she and all 
the other women would send us books and stop away them 
selves we chaps would have a bit o peace Sister is good 
enough for us This incident explains why the military 
authorities thought fit to put an embargo on the unrestricted 
walking of hospitals by society ladies 
Now a word as to two of Mrs Chamberlains definite charges 
the swarming with filthy insects and the lying of sick 
and wounded men on the dirty floors of No 1 Hospital It 
cannot be denied that in the old permanent wards of No 5 
and to some extent in those of No 1 these objectionable 
denizens are at times in evidence but that they are a general 
plague I distinctly deny or that their occasional presence is 
due to any neglect of cleanliness Mrs Chamberlain shows 
her ignorance of South African conditions when she argues 
thft presence of dirt from the presence of 
 
Norfolk Howards 
 
or lice In many of the best houses and hotels in Capetown 
they may be found but I have not yet discovered the means 
that will permanently eradicate them Nothing short of 
pulling down the whole place would accomplish that end at 
Woodstock  but every possible effort is made by cleanliness 
and odoriferous antiseptics and these succeed in keeping 
them so far in check as to prevent any very notable annoyance 
And the facts of the 
 
dirty floor indictment are there To 
begin with the floors are not dirty but as clean as 
scrubbing can make them Secondly the patients in question 
were not sick bat convalescents on their way to England 
who arrived when the hospital was full and were detained 
two or three days pending the departure of a transport They 
were placed on mattresses were perfectly comfortable and 
were not in the faintest degree injured by the arrangement 
Defects Remediable and Irremediable 
Finally let me indicate a few points about which with a 
show of reason complaints have been made They appear to 
me to be there  
a That kits and their contents have often disappeared 
b That the conveniences and nursing in the field hospitals 
were sometimes deficient 
c That there was for a time a scarcity of beds and some foods 
at Bloemfontein and elsewhere at the front 
d That in some cases patients brought from the fighting lines have had to lie for some hours on the ground till tents 
were put up 
E That the cooking especially of fancy articles such as 
puddings is at times bad  
Under a I have heard of scarcely any instances at the base 
although of a fair number higher up Pressure of work upon 
a small number of RAMC men goes far to excuse this but 
possibly in some instances actual dishonesty is the cause 
But this does not condemn the system adopted as is proved 
by the fact that where the official system is thoroughly car 
ried out as it is at the base very few articles disappear My 
informants at the front mostly attribute their losses to dis 
honesty of ordinary soldiers and by carelessness or lack of 
time for proper supervision on the part of clerks and 
orderlies 
b To any sensible mans mind this is easily explained by the 
enormous transport difficulties  so is c 
d Marquees cannot be erected by a wave of the hand and 
necessarily a hospital very often has very short notice of the 
arrival of patients 
e This trouble is inseparable from any large institution in 
which cooking has to be done on a large and systematic 
scale unless an enormous staff is kept Precisely the 
same thing is complained of in the largest London hos 
pitals 
The sum of the whole matter is that if 
 
perfect attendance 
of the sick and wounded even at the base is to be a sine qua 
non the British taxpayer must keep a permanentlytrained 
medical staff of at least six times the present number for a 
national emergency that may never occur again and that as 
for perfection at the fighting front no money and no organisa 
tion will secure it But I do maintain that the RAMC 
people officers and men have done all that human foresight 
and energy could accomplish 
THE WELSH HOSPITAL 
We are indebted to Mr R H MillsRoberts FRCSEdin 
one of the surgeons to the Welsh Hospital for the following 
account of its work down to July ist  
The Welsh Hospital with its staff left Southampton by 
HM transport Canada on April 14th There were also on 
board several companies of the Imperial Yeomanry including 
the 
 
rough riders together with various draftsin all about 
1500 The voyage was uneventful The weather was good 
and the sea calm Our journey out was only broken by a stay 
of two hours at Las Palmas We reached Capetown on 
May 3rd and were met by our colleague Mr Lynn Thomas 
who had preceded us to South Africa We disembarked on 
May 5th and soon discovered that our headquarters would be 
at Springfontein 
Visit to Bloemfontein 
While our hospital was being prepared we the staff placed 
our services at the disposal of the SurgeonGeneral Our 
nursing sisters were temporarily sent to the hospitals at 
Wynberg and Woodstock which hospitals the surgical staff 
had also the pleasure of visiting and inspecting 
On May 8th we received orders to proceed to Bloemfontein 
and accordingly left Capetown by the mail at 9 pm reaching 
Bloemfontein on the morning of May nth Having reported 
ourselves to the Principal Medical Officer we were told off as 
follows  
Professor Jones and Dr Davies with 3 dressers to No 8 General 
Hospital 
Mr Lynn Thomas and Mr MillsRoberts with Dr Laming Evans and 
2 dressers to No 9 Hospital 
And 2 dressers to No 10 General Hospital 
Bloemfontein on our arrival was crowded with cases of 
enteric fever and dysentery there were said to be about 
5000 cases No 9 General Hospital which normally consisted 
of 520 beds contained nearly 1700 medical and surgical 
cases The surgical cases presented the usual characteristics 
described over and over again during this war so that I need 
not now enlarge on the extraordinary achievements of the 
Mauser bullet 
Our visit to Bloemfontein was very disastrous  we all 
became more or lees ill with 
 
Modders One of our dressers 
Mr Eames who was attached to No 8 Hospital contracted 
dysentery Of our nursing sisters who had joined us two 
were told off as night and day specials to look after him In 
spite of the greatest care and attention he died on May 27th 
We were considerably depressed by the death of Mr Eames 
and were glad to leave Bloemfontein for our own hospital at 
Springfontein where we were all installed on May 31st

The Site of the Hospital at Springfontein 
The Welsh Hospital is admirably situated on sloping 
ground 5000 feet above the sea about half a mile east of 
Springfontein Station The frontage is due west with an 
extensive view of undulating veld and distant kopjes On our 
right flank is No 3 General Hospital under the able super 
vision of our kind and courteous friend Colonel Keogh 
RAMC Our left flank is protected by a series of low kopjes 
on which are mounted some 47 inch guns and to our rear are 
several other kopjes surrounded by carefully laid mines We 
had been looking forward to a happy time at Springfontein  
but misfortune after misfortune dogged our footsteps One of 
our sisters Miss Sage who nursed Mr Eames at Bloemfontein 
became ill with dysentery  a few days later Dr Davies de 
veloped the same disease he was at No 8 Hospital with Mr 
Eames Miss Sage died on June 12th and Dr Davies died on

Death of Professor Thomas Jones 
These misfortunes cast a heavy gloom over our little camp 
We were all very depressed and things looked very black on 
June 18th when our beloved chief Professor Thomas Jones 
also died The circumstances surrounding the death of Pro 
fessor Jones were very sad and tragic He was greatly upset 
by the deaths among our staff Dr Davies was an old house 
surgeon of his and Mr Eames an old dresser He suffered 
from insomnia  he lost his appetite  his pulse became irre 
gular and intermittent We were all anxious to get him away 
but feared that he was not strong enough to travel 
For some days there had been rumours of a possible attack 
on Springfontein On the evening of June 18th some shots 
were fired on the kopjes behind our camp These were fol 
lowed by volley firing and cries of  
lights out It was 
thought that there was a night attack and preparations were 
accordingly made It was discovered afterwards that the 
firing was due to a false alarm Poor Professor Jones died that 
night of a broken heart brought on by grief and sorrow at tbe 
deaths among our staff and the worry and anxiety inseparable 
from a hospital like ours He was one of the kindest and mot 
conscientious of men but his nature was far too sensitive and 
tender for a rough campaign His virtues were so many and 
so well known that it is quite unnecessary for meto enumerate 
them here I will only say with all that knew him that to 
know Tom Jones was to love him 
The Hospital 
We are hoping that our misfortunes are now at an end In 
spite of all our troubles I am glad to say that our little 
hospitalof which we are all so proudis in a very flourish 
ing condition We are attached to No 3 General Hospital 
and therefore have the advantage of the advice and guidance 
of that most able administrator LieutenantColonel Keogh 
RAMC 
Our hospital originally consisted of 100 beds of which 78 are 
endowed including onethe Albert Edwardgiven by 
HRH the Prince of Wales We can now accommodate 128 
patients16 officers and 112 men 
The hospital proper consists of 20 marquees  4 for officers 
containing 4 beds each  and 16 for men containing 7 beds 
each We are now preparing an additional block 4 marquees 
7 beds each for enterics only 
In my next letter I hope to give short notes of some of our 
cases I am enclosing a rough plan of the hospital 
THE RAMC SOUTH AFRICA FUND 
Subscribers and donors to this fund will be glad to read the 
following extract from a letter written by Mr A D Fripp 
FRCS the Senior Surgeon of the Imperial Yeomanry 
Hospital at Deelfontein dated July 2nd After referring to 
the fact that he was writing in midwinter though the sun 
was warm by day he writes  
During the week there has arrived from the RAMC Fund in London a 
welcome present of pipes tobacco and clothes for each of the non 
commissioned officers and men on our staff It gave them great pleasure 
for it showed them that they were not forgotten and indeed I do not 
think that Her Majestys forces contain any harder or more devoted 
workers than the hospital orderlies Their position is one of consider 
able dangerI know one hospital which has lost over 30 from enteric 
fever out of less than 200and their work in the wards is exacting and 
continuous For them there is no such thing as a halt unless indeed 
they get sick themselves from the beginning of the war to the end and 
they deserve all the kindness and recognition which friends at home can 
secure for them
