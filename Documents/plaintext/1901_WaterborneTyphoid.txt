was as far as possible carried out malaria would be far from beinglso 
rampant on railways as it is now 
It is recommended that the same principles should be ap 
plied in towns but here of course the steps to be taken must 
be governed by local conditions and the reports are largely 
concerned with recommendations on this head as to particular 
places Daniels points out that it must always be remem 
bered that in a European convalescent from an attack of fever 
his parasites will be in the stage capable of being transmitted 
to the mosquito He must therefore be well guarded against 
the attacks of mosquitos both for his own and his neighbours 
sake and with such an inmate thorough fumigation of the 
house should always be practised Stephens and Christophers 
state further that in Europeans parasites are rarely 
found except in definite attacks of fever and that 
even in the case of those who habitually sleep 
without mosquito nets and exposed to the risks of 
constant infection the parasites were very seldom found so 
that at any one time only a very small percentage of Europeans 
showed the least trace of malarial infection whereas in native 
children in Lagos and on the Gold Coast the frequency with 
which gametes occurred was very striking They insist that 
it should be clearly realised by Europeans in the towns that 
they are dwelling in the midst of thousands of cases of 
malaria none the less dangerous to them though in the 
native child presenting none of the characteristic signs of an 
attack of fever They thus sum up their main conclusion which is 
that malarial fever is a contagious disease contracted 
through the medium of the mosquito from the native child 
Need for a Sanitary Service 
Daniels writing of British Central Africa and British East 
Africa makes the following observations with which we may 
conclude this notice of the reports  
Sufficient attention is not paid to sanitation in its widest sense Sani 
tary works are usually performed either by local Boards or a general 
Board of works with or without medical advice They are not directly 
under the control of a medical department Money set apart to the 
medical departments is entirely absorbed in treating disease that is for 
hospitals nurses etc and little or none spent in preventive medicine 
Most of the money for public works is spent on public buildings and im 
provements which may be indirectly beneficial to the public health or 
not Money devoted to preventive medicine or sanitation should be kept 
apart from either the medical or public works votes and accounted for 
separately A separate department for sanitary affairs distinct either 
from public works or the medical department would I think be advan 
tageous in most places 
ANOPHELES AND AGUE IN ENGLAND 
Grassi has stated that the geographical distribution of the 
genus Anopheles in Italy coincides with that of malaria and 
has used this generalisation to exclude on the ground of 
their wider geographical distribution a number of blood 
sucking insects as possible carriers of the parasite of malaria 
Celli1 snowed that the statement that the distribution of 
Anopheles corresponded with that of malaria is not true even 
for Italy as he found it in various Alpine valleys in situa 
tions where there has never been any malaria 
In the first number of the Journal of Hygiene there is a 
paper by Drs George H F Nuttall and Louis Cobbett and 
Mr 
StrangewaysPigg giving an account of a detailed in 
vestigation which they have made with regard to the distri 
bution of Anopheles in England 
Three species of Anopheles are known to occur in England  
these are A maculipennis A claviger Fabr vel maculipennis 
A bifurcatus and A nigripes Of these the firstnamed is by 
far the most common 
At the 
present day Anopheles in Great Britain are most 
numerous m lowlying land containing many ditches ponds 
and slowflowing water suitable for the habitat of the larvae 
and corresponding to the districts where ague was formerly 
prevalent Further they found not only that Anopheles is 
present in parts of England where malaria used to exist but 
also in other parts where there is no history or tradition of 
malaria ever having existed It therefore appears that the 
disappearance of ague from Great Britain does not depend 
upon the extinction of mosquitos capable of harbouring the 
parasite and the authors suggest that the disappearance of 
the disease is probably due to several causes operating 
together  
a A reduction in the number of these insects consequent upon drain 
age of the land this being in accord wdth all the older authors who 
attributed the disappearance of ague largely to this cause 
b Reduction of the population in infected districts as the result of 
emigration about the time when ague disappeared from England this 
would naturally reduce the number of infected individuals and thus 
lessen the chance of the Anopheles becoming infected 
c It is possible that the use of quinine has reduced the chances of in 
fecting the Anopheles through checking the development of the parasites 
in the blood of subjects affected with ague 
They express the opinion that the firstmentioned cause 
seems to have been chiefly operative and that the existence 
of Anopheles in nonmalarious districts may explain the occa 
sional occurrence of ague in outoftheway places for with 
suitable conditions of temperature and the requisite number 
of 
Anopheles 
a malarious patient coming from other parts 
might infect the local insects which in turn would spread 
the infection to healthy persons It would appear therefore 
that the actual number of Anopheles in a district may have a 
considerable influence on the prevalence of malaria

THE PREVENTION OF WATERBORNE TYPHOID 
IN ARMIES IN THE FIELD 
In a paper on this subject read before the Epidemiolgica 
Society on January i8th by Dr Louis Parkes and Samuel 
Rideal DSc FIC the outbreak of typhoid fever among 
our troops in South Africa was discussed The questions 
 arising in connection with the outbreak might said the 
authors be summarised as follows  
i Has the number of cases of enteric fever proportional 
to troops employed exceeded that characterising other cam 
paigns in similar climates with similar disadvantageous sani 
tary surroundings  
2 Was the likelihood of enteric fever becoming epidemic 
amongst the troops foreseen by the military authorities  
3 Were the best practicable and available means taken 
to safeguard the army both in stationary camps and when on 
the march  
It seemed highly probable that the first cases amongst the 
troops arose from the consumption of water infected with the 
enteric virus derived either from the civil population with 
whom the troops were brought into contact or more probably 
from the Boer combatants amongst whom it was generally 
supposed the disease was present from their first taking the 
field 
Inasmuch as troops on the march were always careful to 
choose camping grounds which had not been previously in 
use unless strategical reasons rendered such a course neces 
sary whereas they were often dependent for their water 
supply on sources which had been already defiled either by 
the enemy or by advance columns of their own side the as 
sumption appeared to be warranted that if it were possible to 
render all water used in drinking by the troops innocuous 
there would be no general development of enteric fever on a 
large scale 
The sterilisation of water for the use of troops either by 
boiling or filtration was impossible of attainment during 
the rapid marches and swift changes of position necessitated 
by war conducted on modern methods Even if filters or 
boiling apparatus could be made to accompany a rapidly 
moving column it was very doubtful if men parched by long 
marches performedunder a fiery sun and in clouds of dust 
could be restrained om slaking their thirst as soon as they 
arrived at water Failing the sterilisation of water by boiling 
or filtration it was asked Is there any substance which can 
be added to water which will destroy the virulence or inhibit 
the growth of the bacillus typhosus whilst not rendering the 
water unpalatable or injurious to the health of the consumer  
Ordinary poisonsor even nonpoisonous disinfectants 
were inadmissible for this purpose There were other sub 
stances howeverwhich might be expected to prove beneficial 
as regards their effect upon bacillus typhosus whilst not 
harmful to the consumer Such were the dilute mineral 
acidsdilute sulphuric acid BP and dilute nitrohydro 
chloric acid PP and the organic acids citric and tartaric 
which were largely used in the manufacture of lemonade 
Other substances with which the authors had experimented 
were acid bisulphate of soda and acid phosphate of soda 
and sulphovinate of soda All these were bodies of which the 
human system was tolerant whilst in the proportions whicli

they had found to be required after contact of from fifteen to 
thirty miuutes to inhibit the growth and activity of bacillus 
typhosus they were quite palatable imparting a subacid 
flavouring which was agreeable to the taste and would 
materially aid in quenching thirst After reference to previous 
work on the subject by Stutzer Christmas Reinsch Schum 
berg and Braithwaite the authors gave details of experi 
ments which they had performed 
In the case of tartaric citric and nitrohydrochloric acids 
it did not appear that anything less than the maximum BP 
dose per pint of water was efficient to sterilise if the contact 
was not to last longer than fifteen minutes Half the maxi 
mum dose 10 grains per pint was inefficient in the case of 
citric and tartaric acids after 15 minutes contact whilst the 
minimum dose 5 grains per pint of citric acid had no effect 
after twentyfour hours contact  and in the case of tartaric 
acid the minimum dose did not completely sterilise after 
the same period Of the two tartaric acid appeared to be 
the more potent in its destructive action upon bacillus 
typhosus 
As regards the dilute acids nitrohydrochloric and sul 
phuric the former appeared to be more efficient than the 
latter  but no further experiments were made with them as 
it was considered essential that the substance tobe carried by 
individual soldiers in the field should be a solid which could 
be made up into small tabloids and not a liquid which 
would have to be carried in a bottle and be measured out 
with some exactitude when required for the purpose of steril 
ising the water to be used for drinking 
Acid sodium bisulphate was not a BP medicinal sub 
stance It probably had no purgative effect as the astringent 
properties of its free sulphuric acid would tend to counteract 
any laxative action of the sodium sulphate The minimum 
purgative dose of sodium sulphate was a quarter of an ounce 
and as the authors only suggested the use of 15J grains of the 
bisulphate to every pint of water a man would have to drink 
7 pints of water before a quarter of an ounce of salt not known 
to be purgative would be taken Even if this quantity of 
water was drunk in a day there is no evidence that a quarter 
of an ounce of the bisulphate would exert any harmful 
effect 
There was evidence that the bacillus typhosus was killed by 
only five minutes contact with sodium bisulphate in the 
proportion of 1 gram 15I gr per pint of infected water  but 
in their opinion it was better that contact should be made for 
fifteen minutes in order that sterility might be ensured Ex 
perimental trials were also made with acid sodium phosphate 
and with sodium sulphovinate but these substances were found 
inefficient It might be used as an argument against the 
deductions which the authors thought they were entitled to 
draw from their experiments that in broth cultures of 
bacillus typhosus the organisms were living under artificial 
conditions and that waters infected by natural means de 
rived the living virus directly from the faeces or urine of an 
enteric fever patient There would be reason in such a line 
of argument if it could be shown that the bacilli on 
emerging from the human body were more resistant to 
adverse agencies such as their chemical solutions were than 
those which had been cultured and subcultured in broth 
That this was not generally held tobe sowas now recognised 
for the probabilities were in favour of the view that patho 
genic organisms by propagation in artificial media outside 
the human body tended to become saphrophytic  and whilst 
very probably losing in virulence yet acquired higher resistant 
powers to agencies affecting their life and growth than they 
ever possessed when they flourished as parasites in the human 
body 
The authors thought there was every probability that the 
agency which proved fatal to the subcultured bacilli would have 
an equal if not greater effect upon organisms of high virulence im 
mediately derived from the excreta of an enteric fever patient 
Experiments were made by them to determine the dose of 
the poison or the number of bacilli that must be imbibed in 
order to induce the disease a subject on which practically 
nothing certain was known Their conclusions were that on the 
whole it would appear as if one might be justified in assuming 
that  1  water naturally infected with the virus of the disease 
did not contain so very large a proportion of the bacillus  
that 2 thiorganism wanot by any means resistant to acids 
 
or other weak disinfectants  ahd 3 that the use of such 
simple means as suggested by the authors for combating 
infection had possibly a future before it more especially 
under conditions of life where the means of sterilisation by 
boiling and filtration were not readily available 
As regards the use of sodium bisulphate during a cam 
paign they recommended its being employed in the form 
of tabloids each tabloid to contain 5 grs of the bisulphate 
The tabloids should be made to dissolve quickly in water 
and for this purpose the minimum quantity of gum arabio 
or other adhesive substance should be used in their manu 
facture The tabloids should be put up in wellmade light 
metallic boxes to hold about  lb weightequivalent to 
about 350 tabloidsenough to sterilise over 100 pints of water 
at the rate of 3 per pint One of these boxes should be 
carried by every soldier in his haversack Supposing the 
soldier to consume 5 pints aday when on the march the J lb 
tin would suffice for nearly three weeks at the end of which 
time he will probably again be in touch with his transport 
Instructions should be given by the medical officer to the 
rank and file as to the use of the tabloids and more especially 
as to the desirability of allowing all contaminated water to 
remain in contact with the dissolved tabloids for at least 
fifteen minutes before being consumed 
The acid tabloids would be found to render the water much 
more effective in slaking thirst and there would in conse 
quence be less inclination to drink large quantities of water 
a smaller quantity when acidulated sufficing The tabloids  
might also be used as thirst lozenges when water was scarce 
and would they believed be found useful by promoting tliB 
secretion of saliva and so preventing parching of the mouth 
The authors were informed by an officer recently returned 
from the war that he found the thirst lozenges he took put 
I with him from England most useful There was an immense de 
mand for them by the men of his company  and the men who 
took them were satisfied with much less water than those who 
failed to obtain any
