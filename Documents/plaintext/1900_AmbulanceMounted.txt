menced It is possible the patients future menstrual 
experiences may throw some light on this subject 
It only remains for me to say a few words about a more 
rare and more complicated class of cases of menstrual 
retentionI mean those in which the whole or a portion of 
the uterovaginal canal is divided into two parts by a septum 
or otherwise and where one side only is occluded If the 
unilateral occlusion is at the vaginal orifice there is formed 
a puzzling tumour known as a unilateral hmmatocolpos if at 
the os uteri the tumour is a unilateral hsematometra I had 
an instance of this latter condition under my care a few years 
ago and published an account of it together with an abstract 
of all the cases I could find recorded in the Transactions of 
the American Gynecologioal Society vol xviii for I893 p 434 
to which I must refer those of you who are specially interested 
in the auestion

DESCRIPTION OF AMBULANCE FOR THE 
MOUNTED SERVICE 
By T F S CAVERHILL MB CM FRCPEDIN 
SurgeonMajor the Lothians and Berwickshire Yeomanry Cavalry 
UHE military history of this and other countries shows that 
when any new evolution of tactics or war mateiial takes 
place we have had the utility of the cavalry arm called in 
question but it has always been found that thlat force enters 
upon new and more responsible duties The institution of 
the cavalry manceuvres in I890 marked the beginning of the 
cavalry renaissance but since the introduction of the magazine 
rifle and even since the beginning of the Boer war in October 
the supreme importance of the mounted services in modern 
warfare has been finally established We see a whole British 
army largely owing to its insufficient mobility checkmated 
at various points and the situation cannot be altered until a 
large mounted force is sent to its relief It has now been 
decided to organise a total force of 20000 regular and 
irregular cavalry yeomanry and mounted infantry With 
such an enormous addition of mounted men we are naturally 
led to inquire how the existing medical arrangements will 
suit such an altered state of things We are met at once by 
the fact that the great alterations in the medical regulations 
which have been made in the past few years in the interests 
of the infantry have not been adapted to the requirements of 
cavalry or horse artillery The ambulance arrangements 
for cavalry in war are practically nonexistent Surgeon 
General Evatt 
We have the same medical organisation and that a dis 
mounted one for both the infantry and cavalry divisions and 
if this system has been condemned by cavalry commanders 
in the past how much more will it now prove itself unsuited to 
such a large rapidly advancingwidely extending and rapidly 
retiring force of mounted men called on constantly to fight 
mostly on foot at great distances from the main body 
When a British army corps takes the field it has attached 
to its divisions for the care of its wounded the bearer com 
panies of the Army Medical Corps These are entirely non 
regimental and quite distinct from the ambulance detach 
ment in each regiment called regimental stretcher bearers 
These bearer companies on foot have to keep up with the 
cavalry or infantry divisions to which they belong notwith 
standing the widely different conditions under which they 
act 
The existing medical arrangements of a dismounted 
bearer company with a cavalry division in the field have been 
condemned by experienced cavalry commanders and army 
surgeons notably by the late MajorGeneral Sir Herbert 
Stewart who from his experience in Egypt described the 
system as  absolutely unsuitable In a memorandum 
which he presented to Lord Morleys Committee in x883 the 
Army Hospital Services Inquiry Committee he suggested 
the establishment of a mounted bearer company to accompany 
cavalry similar to one he improvised in Egypt and which 
had done excellent service Lord Morleys Committee unani 
mously recommended that in the medical organisation of 
cavalry brigades in the field provision be made for mounted 
bearer companies No attempt has yet been made to carry 
out this recommendation neither in the medical regulations 
nor in the new Manual of the ATmy Medical Corps do we find 
any reference to the subject 
The names of many distinguished officers could be men 
tioned who have had experience in numerous inatances where 
the wounded were unattended to for hours and where the 
movements of troops were hindered Among them Sir Drury 
Lowe who writes 
I have often heard Sir Herbert Stewart say how terribly he was ham 
pered by not having his wounded readily transported 
General Lord Ralph Kerr late Commandant at the Cur 
ragh states that 
Cavalry must be sadly crippled when they have only the present 
organisation to look after their wounded 
SurgeonGeneral Evatt described how in Egypt he was sent 
back to the infantry square when toiling with his bearer 
company on foot miles behind the cavalry force to which he 
was attached the wonder was they were not cut to pieces by 
the enemy The late SurgeonGeneral Wolseley was of 
opinion that no greater boon could be conferred on the cavalry 
than the suggestion of some efficient way of carrying their 
sick and wounded 
While on humane grounds alone some new organisation 
should be established it has been remarked especially in 
savage countries how the daring of the soldier is increased 
by knowing that help is at hand When a soldier is wounded 
he is in excruciating pain if a nerve is injured and faint 
from the shock and loss of blood he is in dreadful uncer 
tainty and apprehension as to whether his hurt is mortal or 
slight He is tired cold hungry and thirsty and after 
lying many hours unattended he is haunted with the 
idea that he has been forgotten or will not be found and that 
he will die before relief comes 
Still more serious are the surgical objections The anti 
septic system of dressing wounds has revolutionised civil and 
military surgery The epidemics of erysipelas blood poison 
ing and hospital gangrene which killed hundreds in every 
campaign are no longer seen where it can be carried out 
But as Esm arch says It is a necessity that the patient 
should have a dreEsing applied and that he is brought to the 
dressing station to be further treated as soon as possible 
In the Bosnia and Herzegovina war of occupation by 
Austria in I878 the writer taw hospitals crowded to excess 
there was not a single epidemic of erysipelas or other hospital 
disease as in every case a  first dressing had been imme 
diately applied and indeed sometimes remained on un 
touched until complete healing resulted 
If it is a necessity for the best results of the antiseptic 
system in war not only for the wounded soldier himself 
but also for the other wounded amongst whom he is placed 
to have an immediate dressing applied it is equally 
necessary in order to diminish the mortality to have oper 
ations carried out especially in joint injuries and amputa 
tions at the earliest possible moment PirogofP narrates how 
Reyher in the Bulgarian war found the mortality rise from io 
to 6i per cent by the delay of a few hours in joint injuries and 
from i8 per cent to 35 per cent with gunshot fractures That 
in fact the brilliant results of antiseptic surgery cannot be 
obtained unless it is applied within two or three hours as it 
will be found the highest rates of mortality correspond with 
those seen when ordinary dressings are used Von Bergmann 
in the RussoTurkish war showed how important an early 
application of an antiseptic tampon is in the further pro 
gress of the wound Mac Cormac insists on the importance of 
treating all joint and gunshot fractures qt once antiseptically 
at the dressing station Fischer the greatest German writer 
on military surgery lays down that antiseptics must be 
applied early and that a greater force of doctors and dressers 
must be at the dressing station to carry the treatment out 
fully The greatest danger to the wounded soldier then lies 
betweenthe fighting line and the field hospital and it is there 
that medical aid should be least defective 
Chenu2 states in his report of the Crimean war that we 
had after every fight 5 or 6 per cent dying from hwmor 
rhage many from trivialwounds Ledran puts the percentage 
a little higher It is evident that many lives would be 
saved if a sufficiently large staff was stationed immediately 
behind the fighting line Fitzgerald states that in the 
FrancoGerman year he specially noted the terribly increasing

mortality when the amputations had been delayed more than 
two or three hours after the receipt of the injury all died if 
there was a delay of over eight hours 
It follows from these considerations tactical humani 
tarian and surgical that the bearer company should be 
mounted and able to follow a mounted force everywhere It 
should have conveyances for transporting men sitting or lying 
down every fourth wounded soldier requires to be kept flat 
either in a regular or improvised manner and it should 
have sufficient surgical appliances as a surgeon without his 
appliances and dressings is like a battery without ammuni 
tion 
To provide an efficient medical service for the mounted 
forces the following points are suggested 
I The addition of a second surgeon to all cavalry regiments 
in the field For surgical and physical reasons this is neces 
sary 
2 That the regimental ambulance detachment of a cavalry 
regiment be specially trained and equipped for its duties in 
improvising rough dressings and means of transport mount 
ing and dismounting wounded etc 
3 That a certain proportion of cacolets and litters should be 
carried in the regimental transport for transporting the sick and 
wounded sitting and lying down That these be improved 
made lighter and more comfortable and that they be carried 
on properlytrained horses 
4 Tnat the detachment be annually inspected by the 
InspectorGeneral of Cavalry 
5 That a mounted bearer company be formed to act with 
mounted infantry companies or cavalry divisions 
6 That where wheeled transport is unsuitable or insufficient 
for the wounded of an infantry division the mounted infantry 
horses specially trained be used to carry cacolets and litters 
after a great battle De Pr6val 3 stated that 750 men with these 
can do the work of 15000 stretcher bearers 
7 That experienced surgeons and assistants with suitable 
transport and sufficient dressings be always close in rear of 
the fighting line in greater numbers to carry out at once the 
demands of the antiseptic system 
Proposals for the mounted services artillery cavalry and 
mounted infantry may be considered under two heads 
I Regimental medical aidthat is that given by the 
regimental stretcher bearers 
II Nonregimental medical aidthat is that given by a 
mounted bearer company attached to a cavalry division 
PROPOSUD MEDICAL AID FOR A CAVALRY REGIMENT 
Personnel 
2 surgeons 
i hospital sergeant from the Army Medical Corps who would also be a 
trumpeter to guide wounded to medical aid 
4 trained bearers per battery squadron or company each carrying a 
canvas water bottle pattern as used by Victorian Mounted Rifles portable 
stretcher and straw splints field tourniquets 
I corporal from the regiment in charge of surgical panniers during an 
action 
I private from regiment as orderly carrying field medical companion 
surgical bags and water bottle 
SPECIAL TRAINING 
In addition to the ordinary training of infantry stretcher 
bearers these bearers should be taught to 
I Dismount wounded from horseback 
2 Improvise rough first dressings including the manufac 
ture of straw into splints mats etc as also of other sub 
stances not naturally suited for such purposes Application 
of plasterofparis bandages etc 
3 Improvise means of transport by horseback or otherwise 
and by utilising counw y carte 
4 Signal simple code by flag and lantern 
Materiel 
A light ambulance cart able to follow cavalry everywhere carryimg 
small portable cooking or heating stove for wounded 
4 pairs cacolets with pack saddles complete 
p air litters with pack saddles complete 
4 field stretchers one altered to carry a man on horseback lengthwise 
fixed to a pack saddle by a special contrivance 
4 portable jointed wooden stretchers own pattern 
4 pairs of clamps for sword stretchers Naismiths patterD 
Pair of surgica saddle bags or pair of surgidal panniers with pack 
saddle chiefly with antiseptic dressings which can bemade into an 
operating or dressing table upright transverses fitted to iron framework 
of pack saddle to carry field stretcher in an emergoecy 
2 field medical companions 
4 leather buckets for splints each containing portable McIntyre and 
jointed long splint straw splints straw twigs or coarse grass can be had 
everywhere is light clean and rigidmats and splints can be quickly 
made in any quantity 
4 surgical haversacks 
4 eanvas buckets for fetching water 
2 leather wallets containing hammer long knife for cutting leather 
leather punch assorted sizes wire nippers wire pliers small hand saw 
in case 
I tent surgery without pole in the centre whistles for surgeons and 
noncommissioned officers 
Handfiags 
Leather belts for horses standing by themselves Horses should be 
trained to stand with their heads slightly turned towards the saddle 
The belt keeps them in this position and it can be instantly applied 
Hobbles are most useful but heavy  knee haltering is preferable 
Tourniquets carried by bearers and worn by them as braces 
Revolver Each man should carry a revolver 
The cacolets at present in use for mule mountain equip 
ments should have the armrest jointed where it joins the 
back so that it can swing outwards at present they are un 
suitable for high mules and horses and difficult to load on 
that account They might be more comfortable and like the 
litters might be improved by cyclist makers Horses that 
step short should be chosen to carry litters and cacolets 
The value of cacolets and litters has been differently esti 
mated but in consequence of the reports of the excellent work 
of these contrivances by the French in clearing their wounded 
off the field in the Crimea a Board of experienced medical 
officers convened by the Principal Medical Officer there 
reported greatly in favour of their general applicability to the 
circumstances of warfare 
Surgical haversacks should be carried behind the flap of the 
saddle in an oblong rigid leather case when required they 
should be carried over the shoulder one belt going over the 
left shoulder the other round the waist thus preventing the 
haversacks from falling forward when bending down
