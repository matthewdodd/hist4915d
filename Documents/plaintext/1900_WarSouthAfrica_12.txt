THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
From Our Special Correspondent in Capetown 
November 22nd 1809 
THE RED CROSS 
COLONEL YOUNG the Red Cross Commissioner who arrived 
last week is rapidly getting voluntary efforts into something 
like working order His arrival was opportune as there was 
a danger of the wellmeant enthusiasm of the people leading 
to much wasteful overlapping His organising ability coupled 
as it is with a suave and conciliatory manner is likely to 
effect much Several suburban organisations forthe provision 
of comforts for the wounded have already amalgamated with 
the Good Hope Society which was formed not onJy for the pro 
vision of such comforts but to assist the wives and families of 
reservists and local volunteers Colonel Young addressed a 
full meeting of that Society and it was gratifying to find that 
the Committee agreed to work entirely under his direction 
Similarly on Monday last lie met the Committee of the Cape 
town Centre of the St John Ambulance Association and that 
body passed unanimously a resolution placing itself unre 
servedly under his orders The Colonial Secretary has placed 
at Colonel Youngs disposal an office in the Parliament Build 
ings So far he tells me he is doing practically nothing but 
collect information and get into touch with the various organi 
sations as no need has arisen for any special efforts He ex 
presses himself as particularly pleased with the rest stations 
organised by the St John Centre at Wynberg Station and the 
Docks to which I alluded last week 
TiiE ST JOIIN ANIBULANCE TRAIN 
The St John detachment for train work has left for De Aar 
with one of the trains It consists of seven men who have 
had several weeks training first at railway stretcher work 
and recently as orderlies at the Station Hospital Capetown 
Two officers one noncommissioned officer and three men of 
the RAMC also form part of the train crew Plenty of 
other St John men are available for similar work if required 
Colonel Young has provided the train with an ice chest 
THE MILITARY HOSPITALS 
The Good Hope Society has already supplied a large 
amount of fruit literature and the like to the Wynberg 
General Hospital and contributions are coming in freely 
It has been decided to establish No 2 General Hospital at 
Wynberg on a site adjoining No I No 2 will be entirely 
under canvas Colonel Duke is in command 
The location of General Hospitals 3 and 4 have not yet been 
decided upon but neither will be at Durban 
The Principal Medical Officer has declined the offer of the 
Stellenbosch people of a supplementary hospital at that 
place owing to sufficient accommodation being already avail 
able 
Sir William MacCormac arrived by the last mail and is at 
present staying in Capetown as the guest of a local medical 
friend He has visited No i General Hospital and expressed 
himself as highly satisfied with everything there 
MEDICAL REFUGEES 
Drs Rogers and Keenan lately of Johannesburg have been 
appointed to the South African Light Horse an irregular 
corps raised here by the Uitlander Committee Dr Milne 
another refugee not being able to get a medical appointment 
has joined the same corps as a combatant The refugee 
medical men are complaining bitterly about the action of the 
authorities in engaging civilian aid at home considering that 
being out of employment and unable to obtain any temporary 
work in a colony so medically overstocked as the Cape they 
should have had a chance One Johannesburg medical 
refugee Dr Harding has been placed on the civilian staff at 
Wynberg but he obtained his appointment from home 
THE BOER PRISONERS AT CAPETOWN 
The more severe cases amongst the Boer prisoners who 
arrived by the Patiala are at No I General HosDital The 
slighterones are in an annexe to the Capetown Convict Station 
with their unwounded felEows It was decided at the last 
moment to send these there instead of to the Penelope The 
cases at the Convict Station are under the care of Dr C C 
Elliot surgeon to that institution 
BOER AMBULANCE ARRANGEMENTS 
I have just had an opportunity of speaking with a bearer of 
the Transvaal Ambulance Corps who has come down with 
Boer wounded From his account the arrangements made 
were of the most primitive character He left Johannesburg 
with an ambulance organised by the St John Centre It 
consisted of 3 medical men and io dressers 4 of whom were 
left behind at what may call the  Stationary Hospital  at 
Newcastle Their only equipment was I waggon fitted to 
hold 3 men 2 bell tents and a stock of drugs The drugs 
however were not supplied at Johannessburg but were com 
mandeered on the way They were simply packed anyway in 
boxes carried on an ordinary South African waggon Each 
medical man had a fairly good case of instruments and each 
dresser one of the St John bearer cases There were 
12 stretchers but Ino bearers were provided It would appear 
that any convenient building at Elandslaagte a coolie store 
vas selected as what one might call a fieldl hospital One 
doctor with some of the dressers went on the field the other 
2 remained at the field hospital The dressers attended to 
the wounded on the field and then got Kaflir men to carry 
them on the stretchers to the building There temporary 
measures were taken and all serious cases were sent on to 
Newcastle by train so far as that served and by ordinary 
waggon otherwise 
At Newcastle a large house had been commandeered as a 
hospital and had two doctors and five nr es Not much 
however was done even there the practice being to send 
everybody capable of travelling to Johannesburg Each com 
mando had an ambulance party equipped much after the style 
above described Iodoform and carbolic oil on lint and gauze 
were used for first dressings In supreme charge of all medical 
arrangements is Captain Bleksley who was Sanitary In 
spector at Johannesburg and head of the St John Centre 
there To him the surgeons were responsible They appear 
to have possessed no authority whatever By far the larger 
proportion of injuries were inflicted by shells Some were 
very severe At Elandslaagte absolutely every wounded Boer 
was left to be treated by the British indeed my informant 
who is a burgher of the State tells me that with the really bad 
cases this was done as far as possible everywhere There was 
a great deal of dysentery amongst the Boers but very little 
other trouble Food supplies were scaree and of what might 
be called medical comforts hardly anything was to be obtained 
All through for supplies reliance was placed upon things com 
mandeered en route 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
IV 
PROPORTION OF KILLED TO WOUNDED 
IN the battle at Graspan or as it is to be called Enslin the 
losses which fell principally upon the Naval Brigade were 
24 killed i66 wounded and 7 missing Here we have again to 
note the happily small proportion of those actually killed 
among the number hit The Boer force encountered at Gras 
pan probably consisted of the remnants of the Belmont force 
together with other fresh commandoes and the rifle employed 
in all probability was principally the Mauser At the first 
engagement at the Modder River where Lord Methuens 
force found 8ooo Boers posted in exceptionally strong posi 
tions the casualties although severe 73 killed and 365 
wounded were lighter than had at first been anticipated 
This brings the total casualties for the three actions up to 966 
killed wounded and missinDg

Graspan   24  I66 7 
Modder River   72  396  7 
150  800 i6 
This gives a proportion of killed to wounded approximately 
as I to 53 The proportion of killed to wounded varies ia

different campaigns and of course depends to a considerable 
extent on the conditions under which actions are fought the 
tactics employed by the commanders and the distance usually 
maintained between the opposing forces and finally whether 
or not the engagements in a campaign consist for the most 
part in attacking entrenched positions where one side is 
exposed at short ranges 
Colonel Stevenson RAMC Principal Medical Officer on 
the Line of Communication in his work entitled Wounds in 
War gives some interestingf statistics on this point Thus in 
the RussoTurkish war 187778 where entrenched positions 
were continually attacked at short ranges the proportion of 
killed to wounded among the Russians was as high as I to 
21 at Blenheim in I704 it was I to I3 The late Sir Thomas 
Longmore summing up the available statistics on this point 
showed that the proportion of killed to wounded has been on 
an average I to 4 These figures refer to the number of 
dead found on the field while of those who reach the hospital 
alive a large proportion died during the first two or three 
days but these were not included in the figures given above 
During the RussoTurkish war 1877 781 ii8 per cent of the 
wounded died in the army of the Danube and 30 per cent in 
the army of the Caucasus We may therefore conclude that 
we shall not be giving a too sanguine estimate when we predict 
that at least 87 per cent of our wounded in South Africa will 
eventually recover Fischer whose statistics are probably the 
most accurate on this subject gives the proportion of killed to 
wounded as follows 
At the battle of Kunnersdorf I79   I to 19 
At the battle of Leipzig i813    I 20 
English in the Crimca     I 44 
French in the Crimiea     I  48 
Prussiaiis in SchtleswigHolstein i864   I I 
Prussians at Kiniggratz     I  36 
Austrians at Kdniiiggratz     30 
Germans in 187071      I 54 
Russians in 187778     I 21 
Thlis gives an average of I to 32 It will thus be recognised 
at once that the proportion of I to 53 which is that for the 
battles on Lord Methuens march is considerably below the 
average of past campaigns and is curiously enough almost 
identical with the loss sustained by the Germans in the cam 
paign of 187071 It must further be borne in mind that 
these battles have all been fought under exceptionally arduous 
conditions for our men inasmuch as they have in every 
instance been storming strongly held and partially entrenched 
positions 
Nature of Wounds 
Your special correspondent in Capetown is able in a recent 
letter to give some account of the wounds sustained by our 
men Speaking of the cases which he had seen in the Wyn 
berg Hospital he says that all are Mauser bullet wounds 
except two he also says that all the men agree as to the very 
small amount of shock produced by the Mauser bullets and 
the slight amount of actual pain at the time of being hit 
he also says that one notable circumstance is that the 
majority of the wounds are in the extremities and from 
another source we hear that they are principally in the legs 
and abdomen This the men themselves attribute to the 
wild firing of the Boers As a matter of fact it is an old 
tradition with the rifle to fire at a mans feet as the bullet 
fired la little low will ricochet and do great damage while if 
it be fired too high it passes harmlessly into space There 
was a tendency with the MartiniHenry and still more with 
the old Snider for bullets to rise above the point fired at 
hence the additional incentive to fire at the enemys feet 
The LeeMetford and Mauser rifles are more accurate than 
the MartiniHenry and this probably accounts for the fact 
of so many wounds being inflicted in the lower extremities 
The bullets actually struck the object on the point aimed at 
ft is gratifying to think that not only are Mauser bullet 
wounds frequently almost painless at the time of infliction 
but that a large number of them heal rapidly by first inten 
tion a course which was rarely followed by the wounds from 
bullets of larger calibre 
LEEMETFORD V MAUSER 
The bullet which our troops are using in the LeeMetford 
rifl s is known as the Mark II It is a far less formidable 
bullet than either the Mark IV or the Dumdum but never 
theless has a slightly greater smashing power than the 
Mauser bullet What the proportion of killed to wounded 
among the Boers may be we are from the figures supplied 
unable to estimate I commented in my last letter on the 
extreme importance in the campaign of keeping the railway 
open and it is extremely gratijying to note that Lord 
Methuen in his rapid march has done this most effectually 
with the Kimberley line When the Modder River bridge is 
once negotiated there will be little difficulty in completing 
the restoration of the line up to Kimberley The value of the 
railway for transport purposes as well as for dealing with the 
sick and wounded is incalculable It is pretty evident that 
the repairs to the permanent way on the ordinary veld are 
very readily effected I have had some experience of what 
may be done in a few hours in this way in South Africa On 
one occasion the train in which I was travelling having run 
into a cow was disrailed the engine was thrown on its side 
and the metals torn up In the course of five hours a new track 
had been laid passing round the scenie of the catastrophe a 
fresh engine had arrived on the srene and the whole train 
with the exception of the capsized enginie proceeded on its 
way Navvies with spare rails and sleepers may be readily 
conveyed to the scene of damage and repairs in this way be 
very rapidly effected 
MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ARMY IN SOUTH 
AFRICA 
In view of the large number of men now with the army in 
South Africa the Army Medical Department have consider 
ately published for the information of the public details of 
their medical arrangements The whole or part of this docu 
nient has already been published in many daily papers It 
informs us that every regiment battalion artillery division 
and engineer company has a medical officer attached to it 
and he accompanies it into action witLh his orderly in order to 
administer first aid to any man who is wounded while the 
regimental stretcher bearers are ready to carry the same to 
the dressing station or field hospital There will be 45 sur 
geons in immediate charge of the men composing the Army 
Corps They are also responsible for the sanitation of their 
respective camps There is a bearer comparny for each brigade 
of cavalry and infantry this is composed of 3 officers the 
officer in charge being a major a sergeantmajor I2 sergeants 
and corporals 44 privates and a bugler all of the RAMC 
in addition to which there are for transport 38 men of the 
Army Service Corps under a warrant officer The mode of 
working is described as follows 
Two stretcher sections under an officer each section consisting of four 
stretcher squads under a sergeant collect the wounded and carry them 
to the collecting station a spot chosen as near the fighting line as 
possible but sheltered fromn the enemys fire The collecting station is in 
clharge of a sergeant who lhas a supply of dressiDgs etc to replenish the 
haversacks of the stretcher bearers Here also are placed the ambulance 
of the first Iiine ready to receive them under tlie sergeanits direction and 
bear tlhern back to the dressing station The dressing station is on a site 
selected as being if possible out of fire near a water supply and also 
near a road When available buildings are chosen and if not the operating 
tent is here piteled and instruments medicines and miiedical comforts 
are arranged ready for use and a fire liglhtei for heating water It may be 
considered the most important position in the journjey of a wounded man 
fronii tlle field towards the camp as it is lhere tle first opportunity occurs 
for a careful examination of his conditioni The major of the company 
and another medical officer are here placed with a separate sergeant 
major three noncommissioned officers and four privates including a 
cook The wounded being carefully attended to and dressed are now 
placed in the second linle of ambulance and taken to one of the field 
hospitals which are encampiments attached to each brigade or each body 
of troops large enouglh to render it desirable The equipment of a field 
lhospital is for roo beds but it is so arranged and packed that sections of 
25 beds can be utilised separately if required As it inust accompany its 
brigade on the march it is movable being supplied with means of trans 
port but it is equipped with a view to make it as comfortable and com 
plete as its mobility will permit of From the railway line the sick and 
wounded are conveyed to the base which is at or near one of the ports of 
embarkation 
HORSE SICKNESS 
Since my last letter an interesting description of the South 
African horse sickness has been published by Professor 
Wallace in the Times He has been at some pains to collect 
the latest bacteriological evidence with reference to this 
disease and says that 
Numerous experiments by the Director of the Bacteriological Institute 
at Grahamstown have showed that no material can be obtained from the 
bodies of animals which have died of the malady which could be used in 
producing immunity in healthy animals The use of serum from animals 
which have recovered from the disease has already proved abortive A

measure of success has however attended the inoculation of horses with 
infected donkeys blood and with an attenuated virus got by transmission 
of a virulent virus fromn partially imijmunje animals By this means a mild 
form of the disease is produced a period of at least fifty days is allowed 
to elapse during which secondary attacks of fever and moderately higl 
temperatures occur at frequent intevals By repeated mild attacks the 
system is fortified againist suibsequeut inoculation more effectively than 
by an attack accompanied by high temperature The secondary fever 
which occurs to a horse after recovery fronm a natural attack is termed by 
the Dutch  Anmanning and until thie first of these returns have passed 
off the animal is not fully protected or  salted Inoculation in any 
form is consequently out of the question in connection with the preserva 
tion of the animals engaged in the present campaign 
Under these circumstances we may still conclude that the 
best practical remedy available for our troops is that recom 
mended by me in my last letter namely the provision of 
nosebags to act as air filters through which the animals 
breathe and they should be worn from sunset until the dew 
is well off the grass on the following morning Horse sick 
ness cedema mycosis according to Professor Wallace is a 
fever produced by a microorganism one of the filamentous 
fungi which under suitable conditions of heat and moisture 
grows in the veld but whether in the water on the soil or as 
aisa parasite is not yet known 
THE GENEVA CONVENTION 
THE GENEVA CONVENTION OF I864 
ONE of the redeeming features of modern warfare is the pro 
tection which is afforded to ambulances and military hos 
pitals and their personnel The Geneva Convention of I864 
which was signed by most of the Powers of Europe and has 
since been recognised by nearly every civilised State has 
done much to alleviate the horrors of a campaign and the 
sufferings of the wounded on either side The strict neutral 
ity of the ambulance and the protection which it affords both 
to friend and foe are the most important results of the 
Geneva Convention of 1864 wiile in i868 certain additional 
Articles also signed by the representatives of many Euro 
pean nations provided itzter alia for the care and protection 
of hospital ships 
The Geneva Convention was signpd on behalf of Switzer 
qand Baden Belgium Denmark Spain France Hesse Darm

ART viaThis Article piovides that the fl ig and the armbadge shall 
bear a red cross on a whlite gr ntod Such badge is to be adopted for 
hiospitals ambulances and evacuations 
THE SIPPLE MENTARY CONVENTION OF i868 
The following are taken from the additional Articles of i868 
which were signed on October 20th in that year on behalf of 
Great Britain Austria Barlen Baaria Belgium Denmark 
France Italy Netherlands No th G4ermany Sweden and 
Norway Switzerland Turkey and Wurtemberg 
ART 1The persons designated in Art ii of the Convention vide supra

commander of the occupving tronps shall fix the time of departure which 
he shall only be allowed to delay for a short time in case of military 
necessity 
ART IIArrangements will have to be made by the belligerent Powers 
to ensure to the neutralised person fallen into the hands of the army of 
the enemy the entire enjoyment of his salary 
ART itIUnder the conditions providedfor in Articles I and iv of the 
Convention of I864 the name ambulance applies to field hospitals and 
other temporary establishments which follow the troops on the field of 
battle to receive the sick and wounided 
By ART VII the religious medical and hospital staff of any captured 
vessel are declared neutral and on leaving the ship may remove the 
articles and surgical instruments which are tlleir private properly 
HOSPITAL SHIPS 
The provisions which relate to hospital ships are also of in 
terest 
ART xIIIIlospital ships which are equipped at the expense of the aid 
societies recognised by the Governmenlts signing this convention and 
which are furnished with a commission emanating Irom the Sovereign 
who shall have given express authority for their beiing fitted out and 
with a certificate from the proper naval author ity that they have been 
placed under his control during their fitting out and on their final de 
parture and that they were then appropriated solely to the purpose of 
their mission slhall be considered neutral as well as the whole of their 
staff They shall be recognised and protected by the belligerents They 
shall make themselves known by hloisting together with their national 
flag the white flag wvith a red cross The distiinctive mark of their staff 
while performing their duties shall be an arlDlet of the same colours 
The outer painting of these hospital slhips shall be wlhite with red streak 
These ships slhall bear aid and assistance to the Wounded and wrecked 
belligerents without distinction of nationality They nmust take care not 
to interfere in any way with the movements of the combatants During 
and after the battle they must do their duty at their ownl risk and peril 
The belligerents shall have the right of controlling and visiting them 
they will be at liberty to refuse their assistanice to order them to depart 
and to detain them if the exigencies of the case require such a step The 
wounded and wrecked picked up by these ships cannot be reclaimed by 
either of the combatants and they will be required not to serve during 
the continuance of the war 
SOLDIERS WILLS 
There is one branch of our own law that namely which 
relates to the making of the wills of soldiers on active service 
to which it may be useful to make brief reference By 
Section XI of the Wills Act 1837 it was provided 
That any soldier being in actual military service or any mariner or 
seaman being at sea may dispose of his personal estate as he might have 
done before the making of that Act 
Before the passing of that Act a soldiers will was regulated by 
the common law that is it might have been made by an 
unattested document or by word of mouth By reason of the 
above Section the same rule holds good at the present day 
It has been decided that the term  soldier in Section XI 
of the Wills Act includes an officer and a surgeon Drummond 
v Parish 3 Curt 522 The words on actual military 
service are equivalent to  on an expedition but an officer 
or surgeon while quartered at home or abroad in barracks 
is not on actual military service Drummond v Parish 
3 Curt 522 
Although there need be no attestation clause it is necessary 
that some formality sbould be gone through in order 
to obtain probate Thus when a will made by an 
officer on actual military service is signed by him 
but not attested the Court will require an affidavit 
by two disinterested persons that the signature is in 
his handwriting re Neville 4 S and T 218 And 
where the will is signed by the mark of the deceased an 
affidavit must be filed to show that when he made the mark 
the testator had knowledge of the contents of the will re

ST JOHN AMiBULANCE BRIADE AND TIlE WAR 
The St Jolhn Ainbulance Brigade was establislhed by the Order of the 
Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in Eniglanid about twelve years ago 
being an offslioot of tlle St Jollia Ambulanice Association Its main 
object was to provide organised first aid on public occasions but it was 
also intended that its illemibers slhould be invited to volunteer to supple 
ment tile medical pe7sonnel of the armiiy if required in case of national 
emergency Unitil the outbreak of the presCet war the Brigade lhas lhad 
no opportunity of proving its value and preparedness to act as an auxiliary 
to tle Army Medical Service Tile St Jolln Ambulance Association is 
chiefly concerned with the miianufacture and distributioni of ambulance 
material suclh as ambulanice waggons stretchers surical haversacks 
splinits and bandages and provides for the instruction anld exami nation 
of classes in first aid nursing and hyoienoc and the granting of certificates 
of proficiency Persons wlho liave obtainied the Associatioml certificate are 
alone allowed to enter tle Blrigade umlder certain conditions the prin 
cipal being that they sliall attend at least twelve drills and practices 
yearly shall pass an anmlual reexamination in first aid under the medical 
officers of the Biigade and shall be ready to turn out for public duty 
whenever called upon by their oflicers The total numlber of members of 
the Brigade in England Ireland Wales and the colonies is now about 
mIooo including nearly 2000 nursing sisters 
The first call on the Brigade for volunteers duping the present war was 
received from the War Office on November 3rd and witliin ten days 
twentythree picked men were assembled at headquarters in London fully 
equipped and embarked on the Princess of WVales liospital slhip of which 
they forrn twothirds of the hospital stair The next call for fiftyfive men 
was received on Noveiimber 2oth and on November 22nd the volunteers 
selected from all parts of the kingdom were assembled at hleadquarters 
ready for embarkation This detacliment sailed iD the Sinsla on Novemii 
ber 25th being intended for work in the base hospitals in South Africa 
On November 2gth twentyeight mieni were requisitioned to miiani tile Duke 
of Portlands hospital and on December 4th tbe selected men were at 
headquarters fully equipped and they sailed on December I3th in the 
Maestic 
While on service these men will be under the orders of offlcers of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps and will receive pay at the same rates as the 
personnel of that corps Each man provides his own outflt of under 
clothing and brigade uniform the khaki suits and field or sea kit being 
paid for by the St John Ambulance Associationi or in tile case of the 
twentyeight men by the Portland Hospital Committee 
When it is known tllat time members of the Brigade are almost without 
exception men who ale earning good salaries or wages and that they 
voluntarily accept service under the War Office at rates whlIich in many 
cases represent only about half of the amount they temporarily forego it 
will be seen that the Brigade has good cause to be proud of the patriotic 
spirit evinced by its members The number of men so far selected 
represents but a small proportion of the members of the Brigade who 
have volunteered for the service Many of the nursing sisters have 
volunteered but as the Army Nursing Reserve is more than equal to the 
requiremens it hasnot been necessary to accept their offer 
THE PORTLAND HOSPITAL 
The staff of the Portland Field Hospital sailed on December I3th in the 
Majestic from Liverpool for South Africa It is only fair to remember that 
the formation of this hospital is due to the initiative of Mr George Stoker 
who was a Commissioner of the South African Aid Committee in the Zulu 
war The original proposal was to provide a purely civil hospital to be 
under the direction of Mr Stoker A considerable sum was collected for 
that purpose and Mr Stoker and other surgeons together with a number 
of dressers students from various hospitals were prepared to proceed 
with it to South Africa It appears however that the War Office con 
sented to accept the proffered assistance only on condition that the hos 
ital was placed on a military footing and under military control Under 
these circumstances SurgeonMajor C R Kilkelly of the Grenadier 
Guards was appointed to the charge of the hospital and Mr Anthony 
Bowlby was nominated senior surgeon The other members of the sur 
gical staff were chosen by Sir Thomas Smith and Mr Bowlby The 
change in the constitution of the hospital has been a source of great 
disappointment to those originally selected to take part in its work many 
of whom had made all their arrangements and provided kit The 
hospital has 4 nurses 30 orderlies of the RAMC and 28 men providecd

LEGISLATION FOR MIDWIVES 
AT a general meeting of the NorthEast London Medico 
Ethical Society on November 30th at the Hackney Town Hall 
Dr MATOR GREENWOOD opened a discussion on the above sub 
ject He drew attention to the cause that had led to the 
agitation for midwife reformnamely the incompetence of 
many of the present class of midwives and the mischief they 
caused to the lyingin especially among the poorer classes 
He contended that there was really no division of opinion in 
the profession as to the necessity of some reform and that all 
the controversy was as to the shape this reform should take 
He thought it very unfortunate that all the Midwives Bills 
hitherto drafted had been exactly copied from the Medical 
Acts and would therefore appear as supplementary to them 
and he thought that an unscrupulous midwife would be as 
sisted by them to engage in illicit general practice that 
this would be made plainer if menmidwives were admitted 
by the Bills in question It was true they were not but 
in all equity they ought to be If they were he conceived that 
lO ooe could be blind to the evil likely to be caused He drew 
attention to the compromise argument or argument of ex 
pediency which he said he frequently heard in the mouths 
of eminent members of the profession that they objected 
to these Bills and had always done so but seeing that they 
were bound to come they thought it would be advisable to 
take the wind out of their opponents sails by adopting 
their Bills with improvements of their own He disagreedc 
with this principle If the Bills were bad the profession 
ought not to support them and he denied that the 
Bills were bound to become law in the future He 
pointel out the advantage of a constructive policy over a 
destructive and that the opponents of these Bills would 
be relatively much stronger in their position if they 
had a policy of their own to put in the place of what they 
condemned Legislation bristled with difficulties but 
although the education of midwives was improving and would 
continue to improve without any Registration Bills some 
kind of registration might be desirable He would suggest a 
county register being kept of all midwives practising in the 
county that each county council should appoint a Board 
chosen out the local practitioners the medical officer of health 
being the person to examine all applicants for registration un 
less they brought evidence of having passed an examination 
before another county Board A registration of this kind 
would distinguish it altogether from medical registration 
and the position of a midwife under such an arrangement 
would not be likely to be confounded with that of a medical 
practitioner 
Some discussion took place in which all the speakers agreed 
substantially with the opener of the discussion Dr Sequeira 
the chairman testified to the incompetency of many mid 
wives in East London from the experience of thirty years in 
Whitechapel but he thought they were better now than they 
used to be All present strongly disapproved of the Midwives 
Registration Bills that had been brought forward up to the 
present time
