and the civil authorities in South Africa had been aroused 
to recognise their responsibilities in the matter and it is a 
little difficult to understand why the Secretary of State for 
War a couple of months ago put himself forward as the 
apologist for the administration of the camps The fjrst 
Blue Book on these camps Cd 819 presented to both 
Houses of Parliament by command of His Majesty 
November 1901 appears to have been compiled in South 
Africa in response to a request which the Secretary of State 
for War made to Lord Kitchener on March 18th 1901 in 
the following terms   Please send by next mail a dispatch 
giving full report on refugee camps in Cape Colony as 
well as Orange River Colony and Transvaal The 
rst report in the volume is made by Dr George 
Turner Medical Officer of Health Transvaal to Major 
General J G Maxwell Military Governor Pretoria 
and was transmitted by him to the CommanderinChief 
South Africa An extract from Army Orders South Africa 
March 7th 1901 sets out that the Military Governor Pre 
toria and the Deputy Adminstrator Orange River Colony 
will be responsible for the formation and maintenance of 
iburgher refugee camps In the Transvaal such camps will 
be administered by civilian superintendents under the 
general management of Major Goodwin Railway Pioneer 
Regiment General officers commanding and command 
ants are responsible only for the external protection of 
these camps and will afford the superintendents as much 
assistance as possible Lord Kitchener forwarded to the 
UnderSecretary of State for War reports on the camps in 
the Transvaal on March 22nd 1901 on those in the Orange 
River Colony and Natal on March 29th 1901 and on those 
in Cape Colony on May 10th 1901 The volume contains a 
eries of subsequent reports forwarded at various dates 
down to September 20th 1901 by Lord Kitchener to the 
War Office Many of the reports thus forwarded by 
the CommanderinChief in South Africa were from 
civilian officials but the Colonial Office and the Adminis 
trator Lord Milner make their appearance in this connec 
tion only in the second Blue Book Cd 853 from which 
it appears that at the end of September 1901 some corre 
spondence took place as to sending out matrons and as to 
shifting certain refugees to make room for others but 
attention appears first to have been given by Mr Chamber 
lain and Lord Milner to the prevention of the high mor 
tality then prevailing on November 8th 1901 The facts as 
to the divided control of the camps and the circumstance 
that the medical arrangements were under the civil admin 
istration must have been known to Mr Brodrick before 
Parliament was prorogued and it seems a most remark 
able circumstance that he did not make the position clear 
THE BOERS AND ENTERIC FEVER 
The great epidemic of enteric fever which occurred in 
the army at and about Bloemfontein early in 1900 was 
followed by a serious prevalence among the more scat 
tered forces in South Africa at the end of that year and 
the beginning of 1901 and the official returns for the last 
two months appear to indicate that the disease is again 
making its presence felt The number of deaths from 
disease in the Field Force South Africa which had been 
142 in September and 136 in October rose in November 
to 236 and in December to 351 The causes of death are 
not indicated in the returns but relying upon previous 
experience it will be safe to assume that a very large pro 
portion of the deathsprobably about 80 per centhave 
been caused by enteric fever There has all along been good 
reason to believe that the Boer forces have not suffered to 
anything like the same extent from this scourge of South 
Africa and a piece of evidence on this head is found in 
a very interesting article in the current number of 
Blackwod The writer does not give his name but he 
states that he is of British nationality and before the 
war was a district surgeon under the late Transvaal 
Government He was ordered to join the local commando 
as medical officer and from early in October 1899 until 
February 1900 he was with the exception of three weeks 
with the Boer forces engaged in the unsuccessful siege of 
Mafeking The force he states at first numbered 6000 or 
7000 but laterabout the middle of Novemberit was 
reduced to 2000 by the departure of Cronje for Kimberley 
After stating that the Boer wounded preferred to be treated 
in their waggons or tents in the laager rather than go to 
the hospital organised by a German lady Mrs Weiss MD 
he continues as follows The health of the laager was 
wonderfully good It would seem to an army medical 
man almost incredible but it is nevertheless true that in 
my laager on the Lower Malopo we never had a definite 
case of enteric and we were encamped on one spot without 
moving for two months and then only moved twenty or 
thirty yards farther down the reason of the move being to 
enable the waggons to be drawrf closer together for pur 
poses of defence In the new spot the laager remained 
certainly for another three or four months The oxen 
several hundred of them are fastened at night in the 
middle of the circle of waggons and tents and the horses 
also thus converting the whole space into a manureheap 
through which after a few nights no one would think of 
walking In the warm weather the manure contained 
myriads of maggots which in due time became myriads 
of flies The flies have often been described as they 
were just as bad in Natal  but to give some idea of 
their numbers I may mention that once whilst sipping 
a glass of claret I counted fifteen flies on my lipsall 
these flies and all this filth and yet no enteric  Of course 
the Boers now and then made efforts to clean up a little 
but the centre of the laager was not often passable on foot  
also our water supply was not of the best We got all our 
water from the Malopo a muddy little ditch 6 to 10 
feet wide in most places which had already passed through 
the upper Zeerust laager and also through Mafeking 
naturally receiving a certain amount of sewage in its course 
through the town There were 2 deaths not in my laager 
that I know of reported as  fever which might have 
been enteric but were I believe generally considered to be 
malarial  at any rate granting that all deaths from sick 
ness about 8 or 10 at the outside round Mafeking during 
the siege were from enteric even then any will confess 
that they were wonderfully few How this comparative 
immunity is to be accounted for is not clear It has 
been suggested that the majority of Boers have suffered 
from enteric fever in childhood an age at which the dis 
ease is as a rule milder than in adult life and the official 
accounts of the habits of the Boer women in the refugee 
camps certainly lend some colour to the opinion On the 
other hand it would appear that the Boers are not much 
in the habit of drinking water and that their usual bever 
age is coffee The boiling of the water for making the 
coffee may be thought of as a reason why enteric fever has 
been comparatively rare among them 
LOCAL TREATMENT IN THE UPPER AIR 
PASSAGES 
There are certain regions of the body which for no obvious 
reason are frequent battle grounds for controversialists It 
is mostly one of the natural orifices of the body that is the 
centre of disturbance and the conflict as a rule rages the 
more fiercely the narrower the field in which it is fought 
Within the past few months several illustrations of this 
general proposition have been given in the British 
Medical Journal Whether these controversies tend on 
the whole to edification may perhaps be doubted but 
until philosophy has softened the manners of men they 
must be looked upon as regrettable incidents in the vic 
torious march to the conquest of truth The light of 
science may be 
 
dry but there is too often an undue pro 
portion of heat rays in its composition Hence scientific men
