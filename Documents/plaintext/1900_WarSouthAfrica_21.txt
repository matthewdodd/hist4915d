THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE WOUNDED FROM THE ACTIONS BETWEEN 
MODDER AND DRIEFONTEIN 
By W Watson Cheyne FRS FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Field Forces South Africa 
Bloemfontein April 1900 
It may be of interest if I make a few remarks as to the 
wounds met with during the march from Modder to Bloem 
fontein I can only speak of them in their early stages  as 
yet I have no means of knowing what happened to them after 
the men were sent to the base 
Progress of the Wounds 
From what is said in my description of the march from 
Modder to Bloemfontein it will have been clear that anything 
like thorough asepsis on the field or even in the field hos 
pitals was a matter of the greatest difficulty  and yet it is a 
fact that the great majority of the wounds healed without any 
trouble This is no doubt due to the very small size of the 
wounds made by the Mauser bullet  to the fact that it splits 
the khaki and very seldom takes in pieces of clothing  to 
the small amount of oozing from the wounds  and lastly to 
the dryness of the air leading to rapid evaporation and 
formation of a scab over the surface under which healing 
rapidly occurs In fact the cases which have done best are 
those in which the patients have been wounded in the early 
part of the day and have lain out for some hours in the sun 
The asepsis of the interior of the wounds depends in these 
cases on the external crust  so long as that is undisturbed the 
wounds for the most part do well It is doubtful however 
whether this would be the case in a moister climate It 
was found moreover quite early in the campaign that it was 
a mistake to apply the piece of mackintosh which is in the 
field dressings because the wounds became septic and orders 
have been issued to discontinue its use 
On the other hand as would naturally be expected where 
the skin wounds are large whether caused by expanding 
bullets or by fragments of bone being driven outwards an 
aseptic result is by no means always obtained But from the 
report of the engagements on the western frontier it appears 
that a considerable proportion even of these wounds scabbed 
over and healed without any trouble The experience of such 
wounds on this march however has not been so good  at any 
rate almost all those which I have seen two or three days 
after infliction have been septic and more especially the com 
pound fractures Indeed all the compound fractures with 
large wounds have become septic the degree of virulence 
varying of course in different instances In several cases 
amputation was necessaryin one instance for acute spread 
ing gangrene One or two of the amputation cases have died 
while some will no doubt do well 
Wounds produced by Expanding Bullets 
The proportion of large flesh wounds was also I under 
stand greater in this march than in previous onesperhaps 
owing to the more frequent use of expanding bullets by the 
Boers There seems to be little doubt that expanding bullets of 
various types are now being largely used by them for apart 
from the increased proportion of large wounds numbers of 
these bullets have been found in the bandoliers and wallets 
and in the captured camps In the fight at Karee Siding on 
March 30th a good many men were wounded at long range 
and in several cases the bullets had not come out Three of 
these bullets which I saw extracted were of the expanding 
variety one was softnosed one a Jeffreys sporting bullet 
and one an ordinary Mauser with the end filed off 
Dry Dressings 
To get a dry crust on such wounds is not easy in any case 
and about Paardeberg especially there was so much extraneous 
fiepticity from dead horses etc and the water was so foul 
that the septicity of the wounds where trust was almost 
entirely placed in the drying of the discharge on the surface is not to be wondered at With the view of trying to get a 
better crust I provided two of the bearer companies with 
pepperboxes containing various antiseptic powders with 
which to dust the wounds before applying the field dressings 
The powders used were the double cyanide of zinc and 
mercury and chinosol mixedwith kaolin in various propor 
tions Owing to the distribution of the force I have not yet 
been able to ascertain whether they were used in the subse 
quent battles and if so with what result It seems how 
ever that better results might be obtained if at the dressing 
station or on the field the wounds were thickly dusted with 
such a powder before applying the first field dressings  and 
where the skin wound was large if the dressings were 
removed and the wound thoroughly purified in the usual 
manner followed by the application of a fresh cyanide 
dressing 
Remarkable Cases 
So many cases have been published already illustrating the 
remarkable course which modern bullets pursue without 
injuring structures which apparently could not escape that it 
would be tedious were I to add to their number I can only 
explain them by supposing that a wave precedes the point of 
the bullet in the soft fat which drives the harder structures 
to each side and thus permits the passage of the small 
bullet 
Injuries of the Skull 
The experience of bullet wounds through the skull seems to 
show that a good rule to follow is to trephine immediately 
over the aperture of entrance however trivial the injury ap 
parently is On opening up such a wound portions of the 
external table are found adhering to the periosteum or even 
driven along the track  the skull is perforated and the inner 
table is broken into fragments which are driven into the 
brain sometimes for a very considerable distance Where the 
entrance and exit wounds are near each other even where the 
bullet has traversed brain substance between the two open 
ings I have found in several cases that the skull in about an 
inch in breadth between the two openings has been broken 
into small fragments In many of the cases the symptoms at 
first are quite slight until later convulsive attacks supervene 
or until in the case of old septic wounds symptoms of intra 
cranial suppuration have appeared 
Of i2 cases which I saw at Paardeberg and Poplar Grove some 
time after the wound 3 were not trephined  1 of these died 
while 2 were sent back to the base two or three days after the 
injury and I do not know with what result Nine were tre 
phined from two to eight days after the injury either because 
they continued unconscious or more often because suppura 
tion was occurring One of these was sent to the base on the 
afternoon of the operation and the result is unknown Four 
died as was expected from the injuries to the brain being so 
extensive  3 improved very much 1 being sent to the Boer 
ambulance and the other 2 to the base The last one who 
was trephined ten days after the injury on account of sup 
puration improved very much during the two following days 
and was then sent away but after a few hours in a buck 
waggon became worse and died on the road 
Abdominal Cases 
The remarkable results which have followed penetrating ab 
dominal bullet wounds where no operative interference has 
been attempted have been repeatedly referred to in your 
pages When at Capetown I was shown a number of cases 
in which bullets had traversed the abdomen and healing had 
taken place without any trouble As far as I could gather 
only about 20 per cent of the abdominal cases had died 
In what proportion of the cases however perforation of the 
intestine had occurred it is extremely difficult to judge 
From the position of the wounds from the occurrence of 
blood in the faeces vomiting of blood formation of local peri 
toneal abscesses during healing etc there seems to be no 
reasonable doubt that in a considerable number of the cases 
the intestine must have been perforated  I cannot however 
but think that in many it has escaped When we remember 
the remarkable way in which other less slippery structures 
such as those about the root of the neck escape I do not see 
why the same should not occur in abdominal wounds 
However that may be the fact that a considerable number 
of perforating abdominal wounds recover without operation 
renders very difficult the question of the best treatment of 
such cases The difficulty is still further increased by the 
fact that under the conditions for operation in the field lapar

WAR IN SOUTH 
AFRICAMay

otomy is by no means the safe operation that it is in a Lon 
don hospital Further some hours must in any case have 
elapsed and the patient been a good deal disturbed before 
reaching the field hospital It may be added that the cases 
in which from the symptoms there can be no doubt that the 
intestine has been injured the patients are usually in a very 
collapsed state by the time they reach the field hospital and 
not at all in a condition suitable for operation From these 
various considerations I determined that in the first instance 
and until I had learned from my own experience what the 
results in these cases were I would not operate unless in ex 
ceptional instances  hence up to the present time I have 
only opened the abdomen twice for perforating wounds I 
regret to say however that the results in the cases I have 
seen have not been nearly so good as I had been led to expect 
and I am inclined to think that were the conditions for opera 
tion more favourable one might with advantage interfere in a 
certain number of cases 
In transverse abdominal wounds it is doubtful whether any 
good result would follow operative interference because if the 
intestine is wounded at all it is probably perforated in many 
places But in anteroposterior wounds well to one side 
where there is probably only a single injury and more 
especially where it is probable that the ascending or descend 
ing colon is injured I think that one might in some cases 
intervene with advantage At any rate I intend to keep this 
point in mind in the future Perhaps I can best illustrate the 
results following these injuries by giving my experience of 
the fight at Karee Siding the other day where I was able to 
get notes of all the cases of abdominal injury 
On March 30th I received a telegram from Colonel Gormley 
RAMC PMO of the Seventh Division saying that a 
fight had occurred at Karee Siding about twentyone miles 
north of Bloemfontein on the previous afternoon  that there 
were a considerable number of serious cases and asking me to 
come out as soon as possible This I did partly by rail to 
Glen and thence by horse to Karee arriving there about 
1 pm During the afternoon I went over the cases The number 
of the wounded was 154 and in 15 it was considered that 
the abdominal cavity had been penetrated Of these pa 
tients 5 had already died within twentyfour to twentyeight 
hours after the injury and I saw 10 who were still alive Of 
these 9 were left alone and 4 died within the next twenty 
four or thirtysix hours  five were still alive when I left 
Karee on Sunday afternoon April ist On one I operated 
but he died on April 2nd 
At Paardeberg and Driefontein I saw 12 cases  of these 11 
were left alone with 7 deaths and 4 recovered to a sufficient 
extent to enable them to be sent to the base  the 1 operated 
on died The total result of the 25 cases not operated on is 
that 16 died and 9 were apparently recovering but whether 
they ultimately recovered or not I cannot say Of course it is 
only the cases which are recovering which reach the station 
ary or base hospitals and this may explain the discrepancy 
between my results and those formerly published No doubt 
many cases recover which one would not have thought could 
possibly get well but the above results show that abdominal 
bullet wounds are still very grave injuries and must be 
treated accordingly I may add that among my cases which 
are improving there are several in which the probabilities 
are that no abdominal viscus was injured I should say also 
that I have been shown some 5 or 6 other cases which may 
have recovered but as I did not see them again and as I 
could not ascertain the number of cases injured at the same 
time with their results they are valueless in enabling one to 
form conclusions and their inclusion would only be mislead 
ing The Karee statistics are really the only complete ones 
which I have as yet been able to obtain The following are 
the notes of the cases above alluded to 
Besides the 5 cases of abdominal wounds which had already 
died and of which I could get no complete details the follow 
ing 10 are cases which I saw from twentyfour to thirty hours 
after they were shot  
Cases from the Action at Karee 
Case l The point of entrance was 2 inches to the right of the um 
bilicus and the bullet was found lying under the skin far back in the 
left loin The patient was pulseless and there was much rigidity of the 
abdomen tenderness and vomiting He died a few hours later 
Case nThe bullet coming from the side had entered the abdomen 
4 inches below and behind the right nipple There was no exit wound 
The patient had been vomiting a good deal but not any blood  the abdo 
men was very rigid and tender He was obviously very ill and died the 
next morning The bullet had probably perforated the liver and 
stomach 
Case hiThere was a large wound above the right anterior iliac spine 
probably the point of exit and a small opening behind and near the 
spine on the same side There was great tenderness and rigidity of the 
abdomen He died a few hours later 
Case ivIn this case there was a transverse wound of the abdomen 
the bullet having entered on the right side in the middle of the lumbar 
region and passed out on the left side rather higher up and further back 
All the symptoms of acute peritonitis were present The patient died the 
next morning 
Case vThe bullet had entered the anterior end of the sixth inter 
costal space on the left side and was found lying under the skin over the 
seventh intercostal space on the right side and about 2 inches further 
back He had vomited blood on the previous day The bullet may have 
perforated the stomach The epigastrium was somewhat tender but 
there were no marked symptoms On April ist he was going on well 
Case viThe place of entrance of the bullet was 1 inch in front of the 
right anterior superior spine and of exit behind the left sacroiliac 
synchondrosis There was much haemorrhage at the time His condi 
tion when I saw him was fair and there was no marked abdominal tender 
ness On April ist his morning temperature was 1010 There were no 
signs of general peritonitis and his condition was good 
Case vii The bullet had entered from behind about the tip of the 
twelfth rib on the left side and had left about the middle of the epi 
gastrium and rather to the left of the middle line Vomiting was still 
going on but not of blood There was much tenderness and rigidity of the 
abdomen and he was almost pulseless On April first his general condi 
tion was better but the abdomon was very rigid and tender 
Case viiiThe point of entrance of the bullet was about 2 inches from 
the anterior end of the seventh left intercostal space and of exit rather 
lower down aDd further back on the right side The patient said that he 
had vomited brown fluid after the injury There was much abdominal 
pain but his general condition was fair On April ist there was still much 
pain but his general condition was good 
Case ixThe bullet had entered about i inch in front of the anterior 
inferior spine on the right side had gone directly backwards and had 
come out in the buttock The patient however suffered very little On 
March 31st there was slight tympanites and tenderness in the right iliac 
fossa The bowels acted well aud no blood was passed On April ist he 
was very well and it was considered very doubtful if any viscus was 
wounded 
Case xThe point of entrance was in the middle of the right buttock 
a little above the level of the trochanter  the exit was through the an 
terior abdominal wall in the right semilunar line at the level of the um 
bilicus The patient was decidedly ill  the abdomen was a good deal 
distended and pressure on it caused an escape of gas through the 
anterior opening There was a good deal of abdominal tenderness and 
rigidity I opened the abdomen outside the right linea semilunaris 
and found a perforation in the anterior wall of the ascending colon 
without any adhesions around which was easily stitched up The 
posterior opening was found about 2 inches lower down with a piece of 
omentum firmly adherent to it and completely closing it As the patient 
was in a bad state I thought it better instead of excising the piece of 
intestine beyond the holes or tearing off the omentum to leave the 
wounds alone merely cleaning out the peritoneal cavity as well as I 
could and arranging for free drainage He rallied from the operation 
very well and for twentyfour hours it looked as if he might get better  
but he gradually got worse and died on April 2nd 
Cases from the Actions at Paardeberg and Driefontein 
Case xlIhis man was shot on February 18th and was seen by me on 
February 23rd The bullet entered in the middle line in front about 2 
inches above the pubes and passed out through the middle of the left 
buttock about 2 inches above the trochanter The patient was in a very 
bad way very restless and losing flesh  his temperature was 1010 and 
there was much tenderness about the pelvis and buttock Urine was 
running from the posterior wound but the bladder held about 8 ounces 
The wound in the buttock was enlarged and drained but he gradually 
became worse and died on February 27th 
Case xiiThis was a Boer who was shot on February 24th transversely 
through the abdomen just above the anterior superior spine He was 
extremely collapsed  blood and faeces were coming out of the aperture on 
the left side He was too far gone for any operation but the opening 
was enlarged so as to allow free escape of fseces He died the same 
evening 
Case xiiiThis patient was wounded on FebruaryiSth The bullet entered 
behind in the right lumbar region and came out in front close to the 
right side of ihe umbilicus For two days he had severe peritoneal sym 
ptoms vomiting etc These gradually improved and on February 24th 
he was much better and it seemed as if he would recover While using 
the bedpan on that day however he strained a good deal and suddenly 
became collapsed He complained of violent pain in the abdomen ana 
died in twenty minutes 
Case xivThis patient was wounded on February 23rd and was seen 
February 24th The bullet entered in the right lumbar region just below 
the last rib and came out near the middle line on the left side about 
the level of the anterior superior spine He was very collapsed when 
admitted On the 24th there was abdominal pain and tenderness rigid 
ity and vomiting His pulse was 136 and his temperature 10060 His 
condition remained very much the same for two days and then on 
February 26th faeces began to come through the posterior wound After 
that he gradually became worse and died on March ist 
Case xvThis man was wounded on February 18th and seen on 
February 24th The bullet entered at the upper part of the right buttock 
about the middle and came out about 2 inches to the left of the middle 
line 1 inch below the level of the umbilicus There was much vomiting 
at first When seen there was still much tenderness of the abdomen 
especially about the umbilicus and the abdomen was rigid but he was 
said to be better than he had been He was passing natural motions 
He however gradually went down hill and died February 22nd

r Case xviThe patient was wounded on March 8th and seen on March 
9th The bullet entered a little to the left of the umbilicus and weot 
almost directly backwards and slightly downwards and came out in the 
upper part of the buttock When seen on the 9th there was general peri 
tonitis and faeces were coming out of the posterior wound He was taken 
to Drief ontein in an ambulance waggon on the next day  he became much 
worse during the journey and died on his arrival there 
Case xvii was wounded on March xoih The bullet entered the ninth 
interspace on the right side about 3 inches in front of the midaxillary line 
and came out close to the spine behind at a little lower level The patient 
was very well when first seen and continued so for some hours later 
except that he complained of numbness in his right leg However after 
moving from the field hospital at Driefontein to a farmhouse he became 
very ill with uncontrollable vomiting and abdominal pain and died about 
thirty hours after the wound 
Case xviiiThis man was wounded on February22nd and seen on Feb 
ruary 23rd The bullet had entered behind at the middle of the lower part 
of the sacrum and come out in the middle line in front just above the 
pubes The urine was clear when drawn off some hours afterwards He 
had a good deal of pain about the abdomen and pelvis with vomiting 
and rigidity On the day after I saw him the sickness was less and the 
temperature was just under ioo There had been a good deal of diar 
rhoea with some blood in the motions On the 26th urine began to come 
through the anterior wound and a catheter was tied in  otherwise the 
patients condition had improved He was sent to the base on March ist 
steadily improving 
Case xix was similar to Case xi Urine was coming through the pos 
terior wound when I saw him and there was a good deal of swelling in 
the buttock A catheter was tied into the bladder and the sinus in the 
buttock well opened up and drained He was sent to the base on Feb 
ruary 26th 
Case xxThis man was wounded on February 18th and seen on Feb 
ruary 24th The bullet had entered in the interval between the eighth 
and ninth ribs in front on the left side There was no exit wound On 
the 24th there was marked rigidity of the abdomen with pain and tender 
ness and still occasional vomiting The bowels had not yet acted An 
enema was given with good results On the 27th the patient was rather 
better but there was still a good deal of rigidity He was sent to the 
toase on February 28th 
Case xxiThe patient was wounded on February 18th and seen on 
February 24th The bullet had entered the tenth interspace on the right 
side rather in front of the midaxillary line and had come out through 
the ninth left interspace about the same level There was a good deal of 
pain about the upper part of the abdomen lasting for about three days 
and also vomiting but no blood in the vomit After that the patient 
gradually improved On the 24th the abdomen was quite soft and flat 
and he was doing well He was sent to the base on March 26th It is 
probable that the liver alone was wounded 
Case xxii was wounded on March 9th and was seen about eight hours 
afterwards The bullet had entered about three inches to the right of the 
umbilicus gone backwards and somewhat inwards and had emerged at 
the edge of the lumbar muscles The aperture of the exit was large 
readily admitted a finger and faeces and offensive bloody discharge were 
coming from it The patient was much collapsed I opened the abdomen 
over tne ascending colon and at once came on the bullet wound close to 
the mesenteric attachment On turning over bowel it was found that the 
posterior opening was to the inside of the reflection of the peritoneum 
and did not communicate with that cavity The operation was done in 
the middle of the night with almost no light and as the patient was 
almost pulseless I contented myseJf with closing the anterior opening 
cleansing out the peritoneum in the vicinity and putting a large tube 
through the posterior opening into the bowel so as to establish a faecal 
fistula The patient died of acute sepsis two days later 
Case xxiiiI may add one verv interesting case which I saw two days 
ago A man was wounded in the fight at the waterworks on April ist three 
days before I saw him A spent bullet struck the abdomen just to the 
right of the umbilicus but did not penetrate the skin He became much 
collapsed and when I saw him he was in the last stage of suppurative 
peritonitis He died a few hours later On postmortem examination 
rents were found in two adjacent coils of the small intestine In one it 
was about an inch in length clean cut and went transversely through all 
the coats In the other it was as if a knife had been drawn obliquely 
across a wrinkled intestine so that at three places in its course it divided 
the serous coat alone while at one end all the coats were penetrated 
Where the bullet struck the skin there was a small slough still firmly 
adherent and underneath it a cavity containing pus gas and sloughing 
tissue which communicated with the peritoneal cavity by a minute 
opening 
THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
As our readers have already learnt from the letter from Mr 
Alfred Fripp MS FRCS Chief Surgeon published in the 
British Medical Journal of March 31st 1900 p 777 the 
Imperial Yeomanry Hospital was ordered to be established at 
Deelfonteinonthe railway 27 miles south of De Aar and 474 from 
Capetown Some of the initial difficulties encountered in 
getting the hospital into working order while a single line of 
railway already crowded was the only means of getting up 
not merely supplies but the hospital tents and huts them 
selves are described in the following letter delayed in trans 
mission which we have received from Mr F Newland Pedley 
FRCS Dental Surgeon to the hospital  
Early Difficulties 
 
We were originally intended to be a base hospital near 
Capetown but when we arrived the whole aspect of the war 
had changed  General Roberts had commenced his victorious 
invasion of the Free State and we were wanted near De Aar 
Junction So in two days we had left Capetown and after 
about forty hours spent on a train we were safely landed at 
Deelfontein which consisted of a small railway station and 
one diminutive general store It is situated on a sandy 
plateau 4000 feet above sea level On the south side of the 
railway the ground is flat for miles whilst on the north side 
there is a row of kopjes not more than 600 feet high The site 
of the hospital is at the base of the kopje The neighbourhood 
boasts a few scattered Dutch farms 
I 
 In imagination we found at Deelfontein a hospital com 
Elete 
in every detail and ready for the reception of patients  
ut as a fact there were only a few tents a halfbuilt store 
house a pile of crates and our personal luggage  everything 
I else was in Capetown We soon saw that it would require 
weeks of incessant labour before we could get the hospital into 
firstrate working order In vain did we bombard Capetown 
with telegrams asking for our stores and material to be sent 
on immediately We were compelled to recognise the fact 
that the railway is only a single line and that an immense 
army in the Free State has to be supplied with food stores 
and ammunition We see a daily procession of trains going 
to the front crowded with men and horses and at short in 
tervals long luggage trains go panting along under the heaviest 
load they can carry Goods and material arrived daily but 
not always in the right order Of all things we were anxious 
to erect hospital wards for the reception of patients whom the 
authorities were pressing us to receive but whilst we had a 
quantity of sides and roofs for the wards the parts that repre 
sented the foundation were missing for two or three days and 
work was stopped  
One week after our arrival orders came that we were to re 
ceive 200 patients who would arrive in two days from the 
receipt of the wire This demanded redoubled exertion on 
our part and Colonel Sloggett decided to remove all his men 
and the whole of the medical staff to the opposite side of the 
railway in order to utilise some of the existing accommoda 
tion for the reception of patients The mdical staff and the 
dressers had to work all day long assisting to remove their 
tents and belongings from the old camp to the opposite side 
of the line The tents had to be carried and although a 
fatigue party from an adjoining military picket was kindly 
sent to assist us we all had a very hot thirsty sandy days 
work and the medical staff could easily have been mistaken 
for a gang of amateur navvies  But if life was not quite happy for us what shall we say 
about Colonel Sloggett the Commandant  Every detail con 
nected with the installation of the hospital and the feeding 
commissariat has to be organised and personally superin 
tendent by him and the task of getting us ready in time re 
quires a man with the strength of an ox the patience of Job 
and a flow of persuasive language Fortunately for us Colonel 
 Sloggett possesses all these qualities His wonderful organ 
ising power his untiring energy and his marvellous tact in 
dealing with his men black and white strike everyone twith 
admiration 
The Site of the Hospital 
 
The Bite chosen for the hospital is particularly salubrious 
The sun during the day is excessively hot but there is gener 
ally a cool breeze and the evenings are delightful The sand 
which rises in clouds whenever the wind blows has given 
many of us a kind of sore throat which we call 
 
sand throat 
We have scarcely half a dozen trees in sight The surface of 
the ground is covered in patches with a low growth of prickly 
scrub called karroo bush which is not free from snakes I 
have seen several and we never miss a chance of killing them 
for the blacks say they are poisonous 
When all the difficulties of transport had been overcome 
the wards consisting of huts and tents were arranged in 
I three divisions two surgical in charge of Mr Fripp and Mr 
I Raymond Johnson respectively and one medical under the 
J charge of Dr Washbourn Three medical officers were asso 
I ciated with each surgeon and five with the physician and five 
I dressers were attached to each surgical division The full 
I complement of beds in each division was three times 58 beds 
174 To each 58 beds two day sisters and one night sister 
I were allotted  thus there were eighteen sisters on day duty 
I and nine on night This left six extra sisters on day and

three on night duty to be told cff by the Superintendent to 
whichever wards were temporarily overworked Miss Fisher 
the superintendent Mies Brereton the operating theatre 
sister and Miss Stevenson the night sister completed the 
total of thirtynine nursing sisters 
Tlan of the Hospital 
In the middle of the hospital was a cross shaped building The two 
operating theatres one of which was devoted except in times of stress 
to the dental surgeon form the crosspiece The short head limb of the 
cross separated by a roofedin lobby from the operating theatres was 
occupied by Miss Brereton who had charge of all surgical instruments 
and dressings The long limb of the cross similarly separated from 
the operating theatres by a lobby was occupied as to the end nearest the 
operating theatre by the reray department and as to the foot of the cross 
by the dispensary The x ray room opened by a 4 foot doorway into each 
operating theatre and another 4foot doorway in the opposite side of 
each operating theatre rendered it very easy for the patients to be carried 
on a stretcher or even in a bed from the wards into the theatre or into 
the x ray room for photographic purposes The photographic dark room 
was placed in the farthermost corner of the dispensary so that the plates 
there stored should not be spoilt by the proximity of the xray apparatus 
which has been of great service to us in the diagnosis and treatment of 
several cases 
The land occupied by the hospital was a narrow strip about 100 yards 
wide between the railway line and a long kopje The nurses quarters 
were at one end of the hospital grounds and the officers mess and com 
mandants office at the other end close to the railway station Water was 
laid down throughout the grounds and fed from the tank at the railway 
station There were four kitchensone for the oflBcers mess one for the 
hospital one for the nurses and maids an done for the orderlies The 
hospital huts are substantial rainproof and comfortable The tortoise 
tents with eight to eleven beds and the bell tents four beds each were 
also completely successful  but the hospital marquees of the old type 
were found quite useless for sleeping purposes and were all used for 
mess rooms offices recreation rooms and so on 
The Surgical Division 
Mr Pedley in the letter from which wehavealready quoted 
gives the following account of the early working of the hospital  
 
Associated with Mr Fripp and working under him are 
Messrs William Turner A P Parker and H W Bruce In 
Mr Fripps division there are some interesting cases most of 
them were wounded in the fight at Paar deber g 
The first was a man who was a good example of a not infrequent injury 
in which a bullet had passed through one lung and as not uncommonly 
occurs had only produced slight haemoptysis In a second case a bullet 
had entered through the skin 2 inches above and to the left of the right 
nipple emerging 2 inches below and to the right of it Apparently the 
track was subcutaneous and had not damaged the ribs yet there had been 
considerable haemoptysis 
Gunshot injury to nerve trunks have been of very frequent 
occurrence during the war and immediate symptoms would 
often seem to indicate much more complete destruction of the 
nerve trunk than is consistent with the rapid improvement 
that has frequently ensued We have several cases which 
illustrate the difficulty of arriving at an exact diagnosis of the 
amount of injury actually sustained by the nerve trunk 
One case has a severe shell wound in the middle of the most bulky part 
of the supinator longus of the right forearm The posterior interosseous 
nerve was involved the muscles supplied by it being almost completely 
paralysed but in no individual muscle was the paralysis quite complete 
The radial nerve also had been damaged but only a small part of the 
cutaneous area supplied by it is anaesthetic 
Another case appears to present all the symptoms of a complete division 
of the median nerve by a shell wound in the middle of the arm and the 
ulnar nerve had been damaged though probably not quite divided  
There are 3 or 4 curious cases of bullets tracking for a long distance only just beneath the skin 
In one case the bullet entered just over the lower angle of the scapula and emerged in the middle line just over the first sacral spine In 
another the entrance wound was situated opposite the middle of the 
anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle and the exit wound was 
about 1 inch to the right side of the second dorsal spine both on the 
right side The only signs that remained to indicate the injury inflicted 
by this long subcutaneous wound were loss of power and bulk of the 
rhomboids and the upper part of the trapezius muscles 
Akin to these long subcutaneous tracks there was one case in which a 
bullet entered the left heel on the plantar aspect and emerged just be 
hind the inner malleolus by such an oblique aperture that it grazed no 
fewer than 5 inches of the skin on the inner side of the leg before it again 
penetrated the soft parts from just above the knee to the middle of the 
thigh on the an terointernal surface 
Another case in which one could not help noticing the good luck of the 
patient was that of a Highlander who while on the  
double was shot 
through both thighs about 5 inches above the knee the bullet passing in 
front of the left femur and behind the right femur without touching bone 
in either case 
 
Wounds of the foot seem somewhat disproportionately 
frequent the account given by the patient commonly being that they were sitting behind a boulder which was not big 
enough to provide sufficient cover for their feet without 
pulling up and exposing their knees There are four perforat 
ing wounds through the metatarsal and metacarpal bones 
and in every case there is a great deal of splintering of those 
bones  enough indeed to suggest that there is some particu 
lar liability to splintering in these small long bones 
 
There is as usual in this war a proportion of marvellous 
cases of penetrating wounds 
In one for instance the bullet passed from behind upwards inwards 
and forwards through the ilium about i inch below the centre of its 
crest and emerged just to the right of the umbilicus For the week 
before he reached the hospital he suffered from constipation and acute 
abdominal pain He then suffered for a week from diarrhoea but never 
passed any blood and now with the exception of two scars there is no 
sign or symptom of his having been wounded 
The Medical Division 
 
In Dr Washbourns section there are numerous cases of 
dysentery and diarrhoea several cases of typhoid many 
patients with muscular rheumatism and one or two with 
cardiac trouble but nothing of really exceptional interest 
Mr Fripp adds in a letter dated Deelfontein April 15th 
that the division was then beginning to receive some cases of 
pneumonia Fortunately the hospital had a supply of com 
pressed oxygen which has already been found useful 
Surgical Cases 
Mr Fripp in the same letter states that a considerable 
number of cases of simple fracture of long bones due gene 
rally to horse accidents nave been received 
He sends also notes of the following interesting cases  
Case i Complicated BuUetWound of Neck Faccand involving the Sympathetic 
and the Brachial PlexusA private was wounded by a bullet which entered 
half an inch outside the angle of the mouth on the right side and emerged 
on the same side opposite the seventh cervical spine 2 inches outside the 
middle line behind On its way it 1 smashed the alveolar process and 
the outer plate of the body of the mandible and we had to remove three 
teeth and many fragments which together formed a pit in the cheek caus 
ing an abscess there The rest of the body was not broken 2 It divided 
the cervical sympathetic cord producing a diminished palpebral aper 
ture retracted globe and small pupil which does not dilate in the shade  
no vessel is damaged apparently 3 It has damaged the brachial plexus 
sufficiently to give extreme hyper sthesia of the entire upper extremity 
below the area supplied by the circumflex nerve which is normal ana 
complete paralysis of almost all the muscles of the limb up to and includ 
ing the deltoid But cases of apparently total division of nerve trunks 
often show a wonderful amount of recovery as if the symptoms of total 
division could be produced by extravasation of neuritis or even mere con 
cussion of nerve trunks This patient had two other bullet grazes one 
transversely across the bridge of the nose a mere graze yet causing much 
splintering of nasal bones  and the second an inch and a half long in a 
vertical direction over the right frontal eminence without any damage to 
bone 
Case ii Recovery after Eight WoundsAn officer received eight wounds 
in half an hour at the Bloemfontein waterworks  1 A bullet passed 
through his right loin just external to the kidney  2 another went 
through the soft part of the right thigh  3 a piece of shell knocked two 
pieces out of his scrotum and one out of each thigh just below the 
scrotum The bullet wounds healed immediately and the four shell 
wounds are now granulating up and in a fortnight he will be every bit aa 
good a man as he was when he sailed from England 
Case in Bullet Wounds of Pelvis and Groin RecoveryA private hada 
bullet enter just above Pouparts ligature of the right thigh exactly half 
way between the anterior superior spine and the symphysis pubis There 
is no sign of damage to the external iliac artery nor to any other im 
Sortant 
structure No exit wound can be found and the x rays do not 
etect any lodged bullet The same man received another bullet on the 
inner surface of the thigh 2 inches below the cruroscrotal fold When 
admitted there was a superficial abscess on the other thigh exactly cor 
responding to the position of the entrance hole This was incised the 
bullet found loose and removed and the finger could then be passed 
along the track the bullet a MartiniHenry had made from the abscess 
cavity up to the body of the pubes across the front of the symphysis 
behind the penis and down the other thigh to the wound of entrance 
In another letter Mr Fripp states that everything in connec 
tion with the hospital was working well and that the huts 
were most comfortable and in every way a great success 
Two hospital trains Nos 2 and 3 were working on the line 
from the north and a private railway siding had been formed 
which ran right into the hospital grounds so that the diffi 
culty of transferring cases from the carriages to the wards was 
minimised Special wards had been established for officers 
The earlier cases received turned out very satisfactory but 
the circumstances were different with the men who came 
down from Paardeberg  they had had a three days journey in 
ox waggons before they reached the hospital at the Modder 
River and in consequence their wounds did not run a very 
favourable course 
A rule had been made to keep 30 beds free for the unex 
pected arrival of Yeomen Shortly before Mr Fripp wrote 
No 2 Hospital Train had brought down 96 cases from the 
actions around Bloemfontein In this way all the beds in the 
hospital were filled up with the exception of five but by put 
ting up extra stretchers to accommodate the more convalescent

letter still obtains I was at first inclined to attribute the 
coincidence very much to the operation of a common cause 
exposure to cold and fatigue predisposing to both but more 
extended observation is leading me to doubt this explanation 
I have observed that the No 5 General Hospital which draws 
almost all its patients from the base and the transports 
shows exactly the same coincidence The following is a 
typical case at this hospital  
A staff sergeant of the Ordnance a man doing purely office work de 
veloped dysentery in a form for South Africa very severe He had pro fuse watery and slimy stools with abundant haemorrhage and a fairly 
high temperature reaching ioo F at night for some days stools at first 
20 to 30 daily He was admitted early and given magnesium sulphate 
The symptoms did not yield as rapidly as is the usual experience with 
this treatment some five days elapsing before the stools became faecal 
and there was much anxiety about him Ipecacuanha was tried on the 
third day but proved an absolute failure bringing on vomiting in spite 
of all precautions and even when some was retained having no effect on 
the purgation The magnesium sulphate was given again and apparently 
with effect So soon as the motions became partially faecal monsonia 
ovata was exhibited and the condition began steadily but slowly to mend  
but about the fifteenth day when the motions were still loose and the 
patient still on milk diet pains appeared first in one joint and then in 
another  they were of a shifting character and there was a slight rise of 
temperature but not at all of a pysemic character Sodium salicylate 
was added to the monsonia and in a couple of days the pain eased and 
in a day or two later had gone There were no signs of cardiac trouble 
and the patient had no history of rheumatism 
Another case in No 1 General Hospital is of a somewhat 
different character 
The patient had an acute attack of dysentery then as this was sub 
siding an acute attack of rheumatism supervened with a high tempera 
ture and severe pains The temperature had not a pysemic character 
Endocarditis followed this attack a loud rgurgitant murmur being 
audible at the mitral valve and several attacks of typical angina pectoris 
followed at intervals after the temperature had gone down The patient 
is still anaemic and still has the murmur but he has not had any angina 
for some weeks The latter was treated in the usual way with nitrites In 
this case also there is no rheumatic history 
The Boer Prisoners 
The amount of sickness 
amongst the iBoer prisoners is very 
great The Palace Hospital at Simonstown set apart for their 
accommodation is full mostly with enteric fever but there 
are a few cases of dysentery Unfortunately the results there 
have been bad 22 deaths having occurred to date No 1 has 
some fifty Boers the majority being cases of enteric fever 
No 5 about the same number and the other hospitals a good 
share All the medical officers concur in the opinion that as 
a rule the Boer does not do nearly so well under equal condi 
tions as the Tommy He stands the pain of a wound bravely 
enough but directly he finds himself face to face with a 
lengthy illness he loses heart makes up his mind to 
die and his prognostication is often justified Nothing can 
exceed the kindness with which the prisoners are treated 
Every effort is made as far as possible to put them under 
medical men who understand their language They are of 
course nursed exactly as the soldier and get many little in 
dulgences from which for reasons of discipline the latter 
would be debarred The better class quite appreciate this I 
was talking the other day to a welleducated prisoner a pure 
Transvaaler who told me that he fully expected the kindest 
treatment and that he had been glad when he became sick 
that he fell into the hands of the English as the arrange 
ments on his own side were shockingly bad He told me that 
unless a man were under the care of one of the foreign ambu 
lances there was very little chance of recovering from any 
thing bad The actual Boer medical arrangements worked he 
said fairly well at the beginning of the war but they had 
utterly broken down later There was no system at all and 
not only a deficiency of doctors but those doctors appeared  
just to wander about as they liked so that sometimes there 
were two or three where they were not wanted and none 
where they were Then again he admitted to me that it was 
not at all an uncommon thing for the doctors to take up a rifle 
and fight He mentioned this not apparently with the least 
idea of its impropriety from a Red Cross point of view but as 
a grievance on account of the doctor being wanted to do his 
own work And although this is not strictly a medical 
matter another remark he made was interesting He com 
plained bitterly of being kept in captivity on the ground that 
the rebels who were our own subjects and had been fighting 
were allowed to go free to their farms on giving up their arms 
whilst he and others who were only doing service to their own 
country were kept in prison 
earlier cases 30 beds were again set free No sooner had this 
been done than a party of 14 Yeomen arrived 
Two trainloads of convalescents had been sent down to 
Capetown where they would be put on transports for Eng 
land many men had however recovered sufficiently to 
return to the front and were sent at once in parties to 
De Aar 
Considerable difficulty has been encountered in getting the 
laundry to work as it was a large matter to provide for the 
washing of 750 people a week and up to the time of writing 
sheets had not been available for the convalescent tents nor 
for the medical staff As soon as the laundry was completed 
it would be able to deal with close upon 2000 sheets a week 
in addition to smaller linen The engine which heated the 
water for the laundry provided steam also for the disinfecting 
of beds and bedding and pumped the water for drinking pur 
poses to the filter tanks 
Mr Fripp states that the 40 nurses and nursing sisters had 
proved invaluable 
THE BASE HOSPITALS 
From Our Special Correspondent at Capetown 
Hospitals in the Cape Peninsula 
The hospitals in the Cape Peninsula are being steadily in 
creased in capacity No 3 has now 
66 
beds No 1 has in 
creased its accommodation to 586 beds for men and 129 for 
officers  this has been brought about by converting the 
quarters of the personnel into wards Major Burton has taken 
Major Sylvesters place in charge of the surgical division and 
Major Elderton has taken over the medical division from 
Major Barnes who has charge of the convalescent home for 
officers at Claremont Major Simpson is in charge of the 
officers in No 1 itself No 5 General formerly the Station 
Hospital has about 550 beds but is being rapidly enlarged 
A newlyerected recreation room has been pressed into the 
service as a ward and will probably be retained as such It 
is I believe intended to raise its establishment to over 700 
beds by building nine huts LieutenantColonel Williamson is 
in command with Major Eussel as Registrar and Majors 
Archer and Gibson as Divisional Officers There are now 
o BAMC officers and about 12 civil surgeons Of the 
latter all except two belong to the staff of No 5 a Civil Sur 
geons DarleyHartley and Simon alone remaining of the 
original staff Dr W F Savage has returned to civil work at 
Bloemfontein Drs Troup and Peare have been sent to Kim 
berley and Dr Sterne to Walfisch Bay Colonel Williamson 
has a herculean task before him in the attempt to organise 
No 5 in face of the tremendous influx of patients 
every day It is like remodelling an army on the 
battlefield From the nature of the institution and the 
small personnel the Woodstock Hospital under the old 
rgime was worked with less attention to strict regulation 
than is the case now It was impossible for it to be otherwise 
Indeed Major Tuke deserves enormous credit for carrying it 
on at all without any serious hitch When it is remembered 
that in addition to commanding RAMC details one mans 
work he had to supervise a hospital of quite the dimensions 
of a general without a single administrative assistant and 
with only a staff of civil surgeons one cannot but admire his 
energy Indeed the RAMC officers from the PMO of the 
Army Corps downwards have worked like Trojans and what 
is more they have entirely emancipated themselves from red 
tape and have organised on the lines dictated by their own 
genius I do not think anyone who has not been an eyewitness 
ean realise how much personal responsibility the medical 
chiefs have assumed 
At Orange River there are three field hospitals A good 
many huts have been erected but the majority of the patients 
are still in tents They number over 400 
The hospital trains are doing excellent work The two 
original trains have conveyed 4500 patients up to date and all 
without a hitch A third hospital train has been put on the 
East London line

has been unremitting in his attention to the sick and 
wounded He has on several occasions and at critical times 
carried messages to commanders of units in the field and his 
services have been most useful 
The London Gazette of May 8th contains a despatch dated 
February 15th from LieutenantColonel R G Kekewich de
