THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
CAPTAIN M L HUGHES RAMC 
Kiled in Action 
TEE appearance of the name of Captain M Louis Hughes in 
the list of officers killed in the action at the Tugela River on 
December i5th produced a profound feeling of sorrow among 
those who knew either the man or his work He was acting 
as Assistant Sanitary Officer to the troops at Aldershot when 
he was chosen by Sir Redvers Buller who had learnt to know 
his merits at Aldershot to serve on his personal staff and to 
act as sanitary adviser 
Captain Louis Hughes received his medical education at 
Kings College London where he was Assistant Demonstrator 
of Anatomy He obtained the diploma of LRCPLond 
MRCSEng and LSALond in i889 and entered the 
Army Medical School at 
Netley by the competitive 
examination of August 1889 
He passed out of Netley in 
February 189o taking first 
place and being awarded 
the Parkes Memorial Bronze 
Medal He received his 
commission as SurgeonCap 
tain at that date 
Captain Hughes wasknown 
to military men as an enthu 
siast in his profession and 
as one having the care and 
wellbeing of the soldier 
thoroughly at heart Not 
only has he brought credit 
by his scientific researches    
to the great department to 
which he belonged but in 
matters of practical detail 
whether of sanitary or physi vI 
cal moment he showed the 
spirit of true genius For 
the soldiers benefit he sys 
tematised and placed on a 
scientific basis so empiric a 
subject as chiropody a sub 
ject of the first importance 
to the fighting capacity of 
thesoldfer Forthesoldierls 
benefit he taught the mean 
ing of sanitation to soldiers 
and thereby spread theteach 
ing of his great predecessor 
Parkes amongst all classes of 
the army As Assistant Sani 
tary Officer at Aldershot he 
successfully carried through      
several hygienic improve 
ments and reforms which 
were urgently needed The 
history of science will always 
   
have a place for his name 
His able original and scien 
tific work on Undulant Fever fully entitles him to a 
high place The unclassified illunderstood and practi 
cally unnamed fever which found its most virulent ex 
pression at Malta and was hence named Malta or Mediter 
ranean fever had long puzzled medical men in both the 
navy and army Captain Hughess first station abroad was 
happily Malta He landed there in i890o and immediately 
took up the study of the prevalent fever The time and 
energy with which he worked on scientific methods for siix 
years at this subject served to introduce true scientific 
precision into our conceptions of Malta fever The result 
of his researches was published in a volume entitled Mediter 
ranean Malta or Undulant Fever Macmillan I897 On 
returning to England he was selected as one of the secretaries 
to the first meeting of the Section of Tropical Diseases at 
the Edinburgh meeting of the British Medical Association in 
1898 and it was largely owing to blis exccllent organisation 
and keen enthusiasm that the experiment of holding this qec 
tion was so successful as to warrant its becoming a regular 
part of the programme at the annual meetings 
At Aldershot although in official charge of the bacteri 
ological as well as the chemicallaboratory Captain Hughess 
concern in this department was no mere official supervision 
From time tco time carefullyconducted investigations were 
carried out by him there and we only hope that his un 
publishedwork may not be altogether lost by his untimely 
death 
We have in our ranks but few men whether in military or 
civil life who have done so much work of real scientific value 
as Hughes accomplished in the short time allotted to him It 
is only ten years since Captain Hughes received his diploma 
and his name is known and honoured by all grades of his 
profession The news of the battle of Colenso just received 
tells how Sir Redvers Buller fearlessly exposed himself to the 
rifle and shell fire of the 
     enemy how the members 
of his staff of which Captain 
Hughes was one were hit 
and their hones killed and 
   it was in this storm of missiles 
that Captain Hughes was 
killed We mourn his loss 
as a scientific worker we 
sympathise sincerely with 
his wife and child and the 
 British soldier has cause to 
remember with affection one 
who worked so well in their 
behalf during times of peace 
and in time of war laid down 
3 St i i gi his life in the service of hi 
country 
Dr Patrick Manson who is 
so well qualified to appraise 
the value of Hughess work 
and whp was President of the 
Section of Tropical Diseases 
  when Hughes was secretary 
has sent in the following 
tribute to his memory 
Captain Hughes called on 
me a day or two before he 
left for the seat of war The 
object of his visit so he 
I1 explained was to thank me 
for a trifling favour to ask for 
suggestions on such special 
lines Ifor pathological investi 
gation as the opportunity of 
his service in Natal might 
 W afford and to say goodbye 
The visit and its object were 
characteristic of the man 
his punctilious acknowledg 
ment of even a small favour 
his keen interest in the 
science of his profession and 
his courtesy I saw a good 
deal of Captain Hughes in 
connection with his Secretaryship of the Tropical Seo 
tion at the Edinburgh meeting of the Association as 
well as on other occasions and I learned to regard 
him as an ideal army surgeonsoldierly in his bearing 
gentle as the physician ever should be and a devoted 
and successful but very modest student of his profes 
sion His untimely death is a loss not only to the RoyalI 
Army Medical Corps but also to the profession at large and 
to medical science VRis work on Mediterranean Fever shows2 
what he was capable of doing both as an original investi 
gator and as a writer It is by far the best work on 
the subject of which it treats In its completeness 
thoroughness conscientious accuracy and lucidity it is 
a model Since Bruce discovered the micrococcus melitensia 
no individual worker has done so much as Hughes towards 
relegating Mediterranean fever to its proper pathological 
niche Doubtless had the Boer bullets spared him he would

have given us more and even better work than this for as I 
understood from him he was eager to get on relying for 
advancement not on patronage on seniority or on chance 
but on professional merit hard work and his deserts Sur 
geons in the services sometimes complain of lack of oppor 
tunity for original work of the discouraging interruptions 
arising from the frequent changes of station and other 
exigencies of their respective services as being inimical and 
even fatal to successful endeavour and even of official dis 
couragement Hughes has not lived in vain if his bright 
example in struggling against and in overcoming such diffi 
culties be taken to hearl His book is permanent evidence of 
the vast amount of research literary and scientific that can 
be got through even by the hardest worked among them if 
they make the most of their opportunities 
A military correspondent who had good opportunities of 
judging Captain Hughess work writes For the last three 
years he acted as assistant sanitary officer to the troops at 
Aldershot an office created by the present enlightened head 
of the Army Medical Service During this period he had 
charge of the bacteriological and chemical laboratories at 
that important military centre and extended and improved 
their organisation immensely He was a capable bacterio 
logist and held the diploma in Public Health He arranged 
the medical portion of the combined medical and engineering 
course of lectures delivered to all quartermasters at Alder 
shot to initiate them into the rudiments of sanitation con 
nected with their important duties In this course which 
was first ordered by HRH the Duke of Connaught when in 
command at Aldershot and which was cordially supported 
by Sir Redvers Buller who succeeded him Captain Hughes 
took a prominent part and became the medical instructor 
and so effectively did he perform his duty that many of those 
who attended his classes were able to obtain by examination 
the certificate of the National Health Society given for 
knowledge of the rudiments of eanitation Again when 
chiropody was started in the army at Aldershot Captain 
Hughes took it up with his usual energy delivered lectures 
and framed a syllabus of instruction which it is understood 
the War Office will utilise when the question reaches a more 
advanced stage as it doubtless would have done before this 
had it not been for the war in South Africa Captain Hughess 
death is regarded as a serious loss by the medical service 
where his scientific acquirements were to the advantage of 
the army generally and tended to enhance the position of 
the army medical service in public estimation When 
Captain Hughes was killed he was serving on the staff of 
Sir Redvers Buller as his personal medical attendant for 
which office he was selected by that officer who had a good 
knowledge of his merits from his experience of him at Alder 
shot Captain Hughes leaves a wife and child to mourn his 
death 
From Our Special Correspondent In Capetown 
November 30th 1899 
THE WOUNDED AT CAPE TOWN 
ARRIVAL OF THE WOUNDED FROM BELMONT 
MILITARY medical matters here are beginning to assume a 
busy aspect The wounded from Belmont arrived on November 
26th in the ambulance trains which I have described pre 
viously and which have proved admirably fitted for their pur 
pose Several of the wounded men told me that they were 
most comfortable on the way down A few Boer wounded were 
included in the consignment All were conveyed to No i 
General Hospital Wynberg with comniendable despatch In 
order to supplement the ambulance waggons and to prevent 
the delay in conveyance from Wynberg Station to the hospital 
several large vans belonging to furniture firms here were 
brought into requisition and answered the purpose exceedingly 
well 
WOUNDS OF THEI ABDOMEN AND GROIN 
Many of the injuries are of a severe character there being 
as before a large proportion of wounds of the extremities and 
of these again many were somewhere in the neighbourhood 
of the hip joints Why this should be it is difficult to say 
One hypothesis is that the enemy aims at the sporrans of the 
Highlanders but as the proportion is just as evident with the 
other corps this will hardly hold water Curiously enough 
however a man belonging to the Transvaal Ambulance told 
me quite spontaneously that some of the commandants had 
directed the Boers to aim by preference at the abdomens 
of our men on the ground that Mauser bullet wounds 
would be more effective in that region than anywhere 
else I paid little attention to the remark at the 
time but it has since struck me that this may in a measure 
account allowing for indifferent marksmanship for the large 
number of wounds of the hip groin and thigh One curious 
case of a penetrating abdominal wound unfortunately ending 
in death was described to me by Major Simpson RAMC 
The man had been hit at Belmont when he arrived here he 
ha4d manifest peritonitis and death resulted soon after 
arrival There was a Mauser wound apparently an entrance 
aperture 3 inches below and 2 to the left of the umbilicus 
Just over the crest of the left ilium was an apparent exit 
wound naturally ascribed to the same bullet Near this 
latter wound a movable body could be felt which was thought 
to be a detached fragment of the iliuxn Post mortem two 
bullets were found one just above the crest of the ilium this 
was the supposed fragment of bone This bullet had evi 
dently entered at the wound near the umbilicus and with 
out damaging the small intestine had perforated the descend 
ing colon just above the sigmoid flexure and impinged 
against the ilium The wound near the ilium was the en 
trance wound of another bullet which was found loose in the 
lesser sac just below the great curvature 
PENETRATING WOUNDS OF THE CHEST 
The few penetrating wounds of the chest are all doing re 
markably well In some cases there have been absolutely no 
symptoms in others nothing more than a little early hremo 
ptysis and in a few some pleural effusion One chest wound 
was rather curious The bullet had entered close to the right 
nipple had traversed the chest laterally apparently just 
grazing the posterior aspect of the sternum then emerging at 
almost identically the same spot on the opposite side it 
finally entered the left ulna an inch or so below the 
elbow smashing that bone severely The chest wound has 
healed without the least trouble The arm wound has unfor 
tunately become septic and was looking rather bad A man 
wounded at Belmont the bullet having entered just below 
the spine of the left scapula and emerged in the right mid 
axillary line at the level of the seventh rib had yesterday a 
little effusion in both pleurse but no other untoward sign and 
only a very slight rise of temperature I Eaw one Martini 
wound and two undoubtedly inflicted by some kind of soft 
nosed bullet both amongst our men 
WOUNDS OF THE HEAD 
I saw one bullet wound in which the frontal bone was 
slightly  ploughed for about 2 inches without any apparent 
fracture but with some diplopia resulting In another case 
the projectile had glanced along the cranium but without 
causing any fracture of the outer table but as the patient 
was hemiplegic he was trephined over the seat of injury and 
extensive fracture of the inner table discovered He is now 
doing well 
WOUNDED PRISONERS 
The Boer prisoners are not as a rule severely hurt The 
two worst cases are those of FieldCornet Pretnrius and a 
man named Impey The former has sustained a LeeMetford 
wound of the kneejoint with a fracture of the patella which 
has got more or less septic but does not appear likely to lead 
to anything worse than a stiff knee The latter was hit 
rather curiously A bullet entered just below the outer can 
thus on one side and emerged in the temporal region on the 
other He is quite blind on the side of emergence The Boer 
wounded are kept in separate wards but are of course in 
every way on the same footing as the others and one of 
them whom I knew slightly some years ago was loud in 
his praise of the attention he and his comrades are re 
ceiving 
THE WYNBERG HOSPITAL 
The General Hospital is proving quite equal to the toler 
ably heavy demands made upon it and not even the most 
critical civilian could find anything to find fault with In ap 
pointments no civil hospital could possibly surpass it The

TM 
1759 
operating theatTe is perfect in its way and the whole place 
reflects very great credit on Colonel Supple and Major Simp 
son who superintended its oonversion from an ordinary hut 
camp to its present purpose 
LieutenantColonel Hodson is in charge of the surgical 
and Major Barnes of the medical division Major Simpson is 
doing duty under the former Colonel Stevenson the officer 
in charge of the lines of communication is evidently not dis 
posed to rest altogether on his Netley laurels but is taking 
an active interest in the executive work of the hospital He 
for one may be commended to the notice of the next post 
prandial speaker who feels inclined to reproach the RAMC 
seniors with falling into an administrative groove 
One of the civil surgeons Mr Freemantle has been 
detailed as pathologist to the hospital a very commendable 
step 
The wounded from Graspan arrived here thisafternoon 
FIELD AND STATION HOSPITALS IN CAPE COLONY 
Full details of the field and station hospitals have not yet 
been completed or at least are not for publication but one 
station hospitalNo 3has been established at De Aar and 
several field hospitals are at Orange River or thereabouts 
There are about nine hospitals for the reception of the various 
troops guarding the lines of communication between here and 
De Aar but these are not used for any but the local detach 
ments of whom there are a goodly number owing to the sus 
pieion entertained about possible attempts on the line by 
colonial sympathisers with the enemy Two of these small 
hospitalsthose at Victoria West and Richmond Roadare 
under departmental civil surgeons detached from the General 
Hospital staff the rest under local civil practitioners 
Lord Methuen has with him a field hospital for each 
brigade and one for his divisional troops 
A general hospital is to be established at Rondebosch a 
suburb of Capetown between here and Wynberg The posi 
tion chosen by Colonel Supple who is making arrangements 
for it rapidly is on a gentle slope in an admirable situation 
Another general hospital still on the water may I am told 
possibly be fixed at Queenstown 
The station hospital at Capetown itself has been extended 
to take 300 patients It is fairly occupied now principally 
with cases of pneumonia and the like contracted by men on 
the transports When the troops have ceased to arrive it may 
be used as an additional general hospital 
ABUISE OF THE GENEVA FLAG 
There can unfortunately be but little doubt that the 
Boers have been abusing the Geneva flag I am told on the 
authority of an eyewitness that at Belmont they actually 
fired from cover of an ambulance waggon and at the same 
battle several Boers professing to be St John men and 
wearing the badge on their arms were found fully armeda 
very suspicious circumstance One can only hope that these 
breaches of usage are the result of defective discipline and 
not of deliberate malice 
OFFERS OF LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS AND HOSPITALS 
Several local associations for the supply of comforts to the 
wounded have been established at different centres They 
are all gradually being got into touch with Colonel Young 
A good many offers of hospital accommodation have been 
made from various parts These offers are admirably well 
meant but there is not the least necessity for the military 
authorities to accept them Splitting the sick up into small 
batches would lead to a great amount of administrative 
trouble and the general hospitals can be indefinitely ex 
panded by tent accommodation In the suburbs of Capetown 
such as Rondebosch and Wynbergwounded or sick would 
at this time of the year probably be far better under canvas 
than in permanent buildings There will be no rain to speak 
of in this part for months the heat especially in the 
southern suburbs will never be excessive and the high 
winds prevalent in Capetown itself scarcely reach these 
places 
THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS 
Now that the medical arrangements are being so fairly 
tested that one can judge of their efficiency I am struck 
with the admirable way in which everything is being 
managed From the collecting station to the base not a 
hitch appears to have occurred anywhere As it is the 
fashion in some quarters to decry the army medical arrange 
ments I think it right to put this on record The brunt 
of the whole business has thus far fallen upon Colonel 
Supple who as principal medical officer of the command 
before the arrival of the army corps staff and as 
principal medical officer of the base since has been 
responsible for most of the arrangements He has certainly 
shown indefatigable activity and unerring judgment in all he 
has doneat least so far as I can judge as an impartial out 
siderand the work at a place like this which is at present 
the only medical base both for arrivals and wounded from 
the front complicated as it is by the fact of the general 
hospital being some miles away from the city is no light 
task 
THE FUTURE 
One remark in conclusion and that I make from an intimate 
knowledge of the field of operations and of the people con 
cerned I believe there will be an enormous pressure on the 
resources of the department during the next few weeks This 
will not be so much in the shape of medical cases for the up 
lands are very healthy at this time of the year and the camp 
sanitary arrangements are reported to me to be very good 
But there will be a very large number of wounded The Boers 
will contest every inch of the advance to the bitter end 
Wherever a natural fortification exists they will hold it and 
although we shall in all cases doubtless drive them out the loss 
we shall suffer will be great So far as I can gather the leaders 
have tolerably made up their minds to eventual defeat but 
they are bent on its coming about at a cost which to quote 
President Kruger will  stagger humanity It is as well to 
recognise this beforehand and see that the medical per8onnel 
is sufficient for the future heavy demand 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
V 
OUR REVERSES 
WEEK by week the war appears to assume larger dimensions 
and more serious aspects Fortunately however the reverses 
experienced have only had the effect which such experiences 
have invariably had upon the English They make them re 
double their efforts and become more determined than ever to 
win in the end After all what is the position today in South 
Africa compared with the position in India during the Mutiny  
The men who suppressed that are not likely to be dismayed 
and now we have one of the heroes of that very time Lord 
Roberts going out in supreme command to South Africa with 
Lord Kitchener as Chief of Staff 
General Gatacre 
One of the reverses sustained during the past unfortunate 
week was that of General Gatacre in Stormberg Knowing 
the country as I do I confess to some astonishment at the en 
deavour made to march a long distance for the purpose of at 
tacking the Boers in these fastnesses The country in the 
Stormberg district is of the most wild and mountainous de 
scription and inasmuch as there was no garrison to relieve 
nor any other special condition calling for the hazardous ad 
vance I confess the movement seems difficult to understand 
However we are all accused of regarding ourselves as field 
marshals nowadays and I do not propose to discuss the 
strategy further but there is one peculiarity of General 
Gatacres military policy which is distinctly open to comment 
from a medical point of view General Gatacre we are con 
tinually told is known by the soldiers as General Back 
Acher on account of the extremely long and arduous 
marches which he is in the habit of giving his men as a form 
of exercise The men we are told continually return from 
these marches extremely exhausted and we submit that these 
severe bouts of exercise are not the way to develop  condi 
tion A moderate and rational amount of exercise with 
proper intervals of rest produces fitness but exhausting 
marches frequently have the very opposite effect Some 
measure of this severity would appear to have been carried 
into the tactics exercised by General Gatacre in his last

maroh which entailed upon his men a long train journey in 
the sun followed by an exhausting night march immediately 
preceding an attack upon the enemy 
Magersfontein 
The list of casualties at Magersfontein appeared in detail 
on Saturday The total loss in killed and wounded in these 
engagements was 957 this consisted of 125 killed 642 
wounded and I90 missing From this it will be seen that 
again the proportion of killed to wounded is by no means 
high and that in faceof the fact that our troops were gallantly 
storming a trongly entrenched position Reuters corre 
spondent states that the ambulance service was magnificently 
organised This is a gratifying tribute to the medical depart 
ment and we have the further testimony of Cronje himself 
in his despatch to Kruger in which he commented on the 
completeness of the ambulance arrangements among the 
British forces With regard to this battle I would add one 
word It is true that Lord Methuen did not succeed in taking 
the position but nevertheless it is certain that the loss in 
flicted upon the enemy was at least as great if not greater 
thav pur own and it is therefore unfair to speak of this 
engagement as if it had been a defeat Lord Methuens 
column has marched with signal success from the Orange 
River driving the Boers before him The seizure of the 
Madder River was a most important one and the holding of 
it is of the greatest strategic importance That Lord Methuen 
shouId have accomplished it alone entitles him to our admira 
tion to be astonished that he did not then forthwith succeed 
in driving the reinforced Boers from their position in the 
Magersfontein is unreasonable 
The Tugela 
From the Tugela River we have the sad news that 82 officers 
and men have been killed 667 wounded and 348 missing pre 
sumably prisoners making a total of 1097 Here again the 
proportion of killed to wounded is small and is pretty conclu 
sive evidence that the wounds were inflicted almost entirely 
by the Mauser rifle and probablymanyof them at long ranges 
The individual shooting of the Boers is undoubtedly shown in 
this engagement As with the operating surgeon the first 
essential is skill and knowledge in the use of his instruments 
so surely with the soldier who is a rifleman the first essential 
is knowledge and skill in the use of the rifle In that know 
ledge and skill the Boer especially the hunting Boer and 
probably those very Boers selected to meet Buller on the 
Tugela were undoubtedly proficient Are our soldiers when 
not actually engaged in fighting the enemy now getting the 
one thing necessary to give them that skillthat is field 
firing with the rifle The veld is wide and opportunities of 
camp life ample What qualities the Boers have which our 
soldiers do not at present possess must be taught our soldiers 
Marksmanship is not a difficult art and may be learned and 
nowhere more easily than on the South frican veld What 
opportunity for instance have the reservists recently rushed 
out had to acquire any skill with the rifle  Many of them 
have been for seven years working as artisans or labourers 
without firing a shot It is obvious that they must have some 
opportunity of acquiring the requisite skill 
TROOPSHIPS 
On Saturday I had an opportunity of visiting the Avoca 
one of the transports sailing from Southampton with troops 
for South Africa The arrangements on board struck me as 
admirable The Avoca is one of the British India Companys 
ships and principally intended for the conveyance of pas 
sengers Her deck accommodation is fairly large and I was 
interested to note that the authorities had wisely portioned 
off one half of the upper deckwhich is usually reserved for 
firstclass passengersfor the use of the men On this deck 
it will be possible for the men during the voyage to take 
exercise to drill and generally to keep themselves usefully 
employed from a service point of view What is known as 
poke drill that is pointing with the empty rifle can at any 
rate be practised on board this and all other troopships The 
voyage under these conditions should be found beneficial to 
officers and men both in health and in some slight measure 
n necessary discipline 
I  NETLEY 
From the Avoca I ran down to Netley where the PMO 
LieutenantColonel Charlton received me I visited various 
wards of the hospital and saw among other patients men who 
had recently come home in the Jelunga The papers had 
stated that these men were some of the wounded from the 
seat of war in South Africa but I found that only one of the 
Jelungas passengers was actually a wounded man and he was 
not at Netley Of the others I saw some of the privates and 
among them found two or three men who had developed 
rupture and had been invalided home the others were 
principally medical cases One of the men I spoke to had been 
with the camp at the Orange River they all spoke well of the 
treatment they had received at the front on the railway 
journey down and on board the transports and they certainly 
are extremely comfortable and in good quarters at Netley 
SENDING HOME THE WOUNDED 
With regard to the disposal of the sick and wounded a 
letter was written to the Times of December 13th by Sir 
Henry Howarth inquiring why the sick and wounded are 
being sent home 
The Cape of Giood Hope and Natal are he says two of the most famous 
sanatoria in the world   This being so what possible justification can 
there be for sending home shiploads of sick and wounded men who have 
to face the very real discomforts of a sea voyage to cross the Bay of Bis 
cay at this season to arrive in England in the middle of winter and per 
haps to be landed as the other day in rain and fog 
to this SurgeonGeneral Hamilton RP lately PMO in 
South Africa replied as follows 
The climate at the Cape at this season is very hot and dry that of Natal 
hot and dampneither of them ideal places for sick and wounded men 
No doubt the  karroo or elevated tableland is a suitableclimate for cases 
of tuberculosis but the accommodation food and attendance are so vile 
that all good done by the climate is counterbalanced by the discomforts 
From a military point of view it is absolutely necessary to send home all 
cases of sick and wounded not likely to be fit to rejoin their corps within 
a reasonable time The chief base hospital is at Wynberg a suburb of 
Capetown about nine miles distant by rail The regular hospital there 
can only accommodate about filfty sick but the barracks close by have 
been taken over as a hospital and can hold about 500 sick and wounded 
These barracks are really only huts and the accommodation especially as 
regards the subsidiary buildings is not at all ideal for hospital purposes 
Tents at this time of the year are very hot It is therefore most necessary 
to send home everycase of wound or sickness not likely soon to be fit for 
duty to make way for the fresh sick and wounded being sent down daily 
from the front 
SurgeonGeneral Hamiltons answer appears to be conclu 
sive No doubt the cases sent home will be those so severely 
wounded as to preclude any prospect of their again taking 
part in the campaign and it is only natural that a man 
thus situated should desire to be near his friends At the 
present time and with the modern appliances in the shape of 
hospital ships there is no reason why a man should sufier any 
hardship whatever during the voyage  in fact the modern 
ocean steamer makes a much more comfortable hospital than 
tents or huts during the hot summer in South Africa 
FIELD RATIONS 
A correspondent has asked as to the field rations for our 
troops The health of the troops he says in future 
depends in a great measure on it It is desirable that it 
should be given to the profession in full detail The ration 
is given as Appendix VII of the medical arrangements pub 
lished for the information of the Field Force in South Africa 
and is as follows

The scale of daily rations for civilian subordinates will be as follows 
a White conductors same as European soldiers 
b Native employees including drivers and leaders 
I lb meal biscuit or bread 
I lb freslh or preserved meat 
2 OZ sugar 
I OZ co ee or i oz tea 
3 oz salt 
The following scale of equivalents which are to be considered as 
alternatives 
Meal 
Biscuit Ilbi lb mealie flour or mealie meal 
Bread 
Meat i lbxl lb mealie flour or mealie meal where there 
is not a sufficiency of meat 
In all other matters not mentioned in the above the Allowance Regula 
tions will be followed for equivalents or in special articles not therein 
named G 0 C will decide them 
While this will be adhered to as closely as circumstances 
will allow it is quite probable that the exigencies of the 
campaign may bring about a considerable modification from 
time to time It all depends upon the commissariat together 
with the resources of the country in which the soldier finds 
himself During a campaign in which I served there was 
considerable variety in the ration We began with tinned 
meat cattle were then captured from the enemy and for the 
rest of the campaign fresh meat and milk were always forth 
coming then again for a week or two the neighbourhood of 
mealie fields enabled an unlimited quantity of fresh mealies 
to be substitutcd for much of the daily ration It is well 
therefore to bear in mind that the ration must vary according 
to circumstances sometimes with advantage to the soldier 
and sometimes with disadvantage 
CIVIL SURGEONS 
There have been countless applications for employment as 
civil surgeons with the forces in South Africa and the 
DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical Department stated a 
week or two ago that he then had 4oo names on his list The 
surgeons serving in this capacity are attached to the Army 
Medical Department and are styled simply  Surgeon Their 
uniforms consist of plain khaki tunic breeches and puttees 
and is in appearance almost exactly that of the combatant 
officers they enjoy the rank and privileges though not the 
title of Captain Each one hlas a servant and a horse 
found him and receives pay at the rate of i a day he is 
engaged for twelve months the department retaining a right 
to terminate his services at any time on the payment of two 
months pay His camp equipment is simple but complete 
it consists of a canvas stretcher cork mattress with a blanket 
fixed on in the shape of a bag and a waterproof covering which 
may be used or thrown aside as required which like the 
blanketis also attached to the mattress He also has a readily 
portable table a small camp chair and a tin case containing 
cup plate teapot etc These things are purchased by the 
surgeon and then an advance of 40 out of his pay is made at 
the time of joining to enable him to meet the necessary 
outlay 
The completeness thoughtfulness and care with which 
the whole of the medical arrangements are being supervised 
have already been evidenced in the field and cannot fail to be 
recognised at the close of the campaign 
BOER AMBIULANCE 
The Boer forces we are informed have an ambulance which 
is under the superintence of Captain Bleksley Captain 
Bleksley has been in the employ of the Transvaal Government 
for some time as sanitary inspector in Johannesburg and is 
well known to the writer The ambulance arrangements of 
the Boers are of the most primitive description but this is 
more the fault of the Boer commanders than of the ambulance 
department who are probably but very poorly found in re 
sources 
THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS AT MAGERS 
FONTEIN AND THE TUGELA 
Magersfontein 
IN a message sent on December 12th from the battlefield in 
front of Magersfontein Reuters correspondent wrote 
The ambulance service was magnificently organised and the bravery of 
the surgeons while attending to the wounded in the firing line is the 
subject of the highest admiration among our men 
The correspondent of the same agency at Orange River 
after announcing the arrival of two hospital trains with 
wounded from the action wrote 
Many acts of heroism are recorded An officer of the Army Medical 
Corps attended the sick in the firing line until he was killed 
HEappily it would seem that the statement that the officer 
was killed was shown by the official casualty lists to be in 
correct The medical officer attached to the Black Watch 
2nd Batt Royal Highlanders which suffered so heavily at 
the outset losing 45 killed and 184 wounded besides missing 
was Lieutenant EI E M Douglas who is returned in the 
casualty list as wounded The Tines correspondent tele 
graphing with regard to the same battle says 
The work of the medical staff was beyond praise Their promptness In 
relieving and removing the wounded under hot fire was extraordinary 
though the doctors were ultimately compelled to forego attending the 
wounded near the trenches as many men who might otherwise have 
been saved were shot while being attended to the enemys fire being 
always drawn to those points 
The correspondent of the Daily Tekgraph telegraphed 
The greatest bravery was shown by the officers and men of the Royal 
Army Medical Corps in dressing the injuries of the wounded and in 
bringing them in under a heavy fire Cartenson attached to the 8eaforth 
Highlanders went into action with the regiment early in the morning 
and dressed the wounds of several men in the fighting line and brought 
others to the rear 
When the ambulance was brought up about noon Ithe Boers would not 
allow it to come nearer than 500 yards 
Ensor however went on alone within 300 yards of the enemu and 
brought back a wounded man although a heavy fire was directed on him 
by the Boers 
Captain Probyn attached to the Gordon Highlanders walked erect up 
and down the firing line attending to the wounded officers and men 
under a hail of bulletz 
All the doctors and stretcherbearers indeed showed the greatest 
coolness 
There is evidently some error in names in this despatch 
The medical officers attached to the other components of the 
Highland Brigade according to the official list are 2nd 
Battalion Seaforth Highlanders Major G E Moffett ist 
Battalion Highland Light Infantry Lieutenant T C Mac 
Kenzie ist Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders 
Captain J E Carter The medical officer of the ist Battalion 
Gordon Highlanders which advanced to the relief of the 
Highlanders Brigade after the surprise is Captain P J 
Probyn who entered the service in I896 
Lieutenant Ensor was originally attached for duty to No 3 
General Hospital as officer in charge of the xray apparatus 
Lieutenants Douglas Ensor and Mackenzie only received 
their commissions last July after passing through the 
Army Medical School at Netley Major C H Burtchaell 
who is reported to have been taken prisoner was Secretary to 
the Principal Medical Officer of the First Division that which 
includes the Guards and officer in medical charge of the 
staff 
Reuters agent telegraphing from the OrangeRiver says 
The military hospital here is in a healthy losition to the south of the 
camp The wounded have nothing but praise for the treatment which 
they received at the hands of the medical department on the battle 
field 
Tle Tugela 
Captain M L Hughes who is reported killed in General 
Bullers disastrous action at the Tugela was attached to the 
staff of the Principal Medical Officer of the force in South 
Africa as special sanitary expert His death is a severe loss 
to the service and to the force in Natal The 14th and 66th 
Batteries Royal Field Artillery which had to abandon guns in 
this action formed part of the field artillery of the ist Infantry 
Division and the medical officer was Lieutenant E T Inkson 
who received his commission last July The medical officer 
of the ist Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers which had 
ten casualies among the officers is Major John Henderson 
Brannigan who is probably the officer of the RAMC re 
turned as slightly wounded He entered the service in x885 
THE RED CROSS TRAIN 
The contract for the construction of a special hospital train 
for the Central British Red Cross Committee was signed on 
October i8th and the work which in ordinary times would 
have occupied eight months has been finished in ten weeks 
It was at first intended that the train should be composed of 
ten carriages but as the railways are single lines of narrow 
gauge with severe gradients it was found necessary to limit 
the number to seven The train consists of seven bogie 
corridor carriages each about 36 feet in length and 8 feet in 
width the passage through the centre being continuous The

first carriage is divided into three compartments for linen and 
other stores for two invalid officers and for two nurses respec 
tively The second carriage is also divided into a compart 
ment for two medical officers a dining room and a surgery 
The third fourth fifth and sixth carriages are each con 
structed to carry eighteen invalids and four hospital orderlies 
Owing the limited space the beds have been necessarily 
placed in three tiers The difficulty of placing a help 
less patient sideways on a bed closed on all sides but one 
from a gangway 2 feet 6 inches in width in which there is 
only room for one bearer at the head of the stretcher and one 
at the foot has been met by an arrangement of pulleys in the 
roof which enables each bed with a patient on it to be raised 
to the proper level by one man whilst the hands of the two 
bearers are thus left free to guide and fix it in position Each 
carriage is provided with a stove a lavatory and a closet and 
necessary storing lockers The seventh carriage contains the 
kitchen and pantry including berths for two cooks and a 
compartment between for the guard Cooking appliances 
cisterns containing cold water storage two large filters a 
refrigerator and everything necessary for 97 persons are 
provided besides fitted cupboards and drawers for linen cloth 
ing surgical and medical stores cutlery glass crockery 
provisions etc two lockers have been placed in the roof of 
each carriage for linen etc The whole train is light and airy 
and the enamelled white ironwork and fittings and the bright 
draperies produce a cheerful effect As the train may have to 
be loaded in places remote from buildings and exposed to sun 
rain and dust an awning has been provided suspended to 
to hooks over the carriage doors and supported by telescopic 
iron posts Under this shelter invalids can be transferred 
from stretchers to the beds they will occupy in the train 
Towards the cost of the train the Borough of Windsor con 
tributed 6ioo and Princess Christian added 650 the 
balance of a Red Cross fund invested in her name after the 
Soudan Campaign of I885 In deference to the wish expressed 
by the royal borough the train will bear in the centre panel 
on each side of every carriage a conspicuous Red Cross on a 
white ground encircled with the words  Princess Christian 
Hospital Train In sockets at the head of the train are two 
flags the Union Jack and the Red Cross in accordance with 
Article vii of the Convention of Geneva Sir John Furley 
under whose supervision the train has been built will 
accompany it to South Africa early next month

MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE AUXILIARY 
FORCES 
IT is not anticipated that any serious difficulty will be 
encountered in making the necessary medical arrangements 
for the Yeomanry and Volunteers who are to serve in South 
Africa In the case of the Volunteers as the force will be 
attached to regiments already provided with regimental 
medical officers with existing brigade bearer comnpanies and 
field hospitals no medical help will be required The 
Yeomanry Brigade should have no difficulty as there are 
sufficient medical officers belonging to the service to supply 
assistance to the brigade and the only regret will be that the 
brigade to be raised is not 6ooo in place of 3000 
The Militia Medical Staff Corps will it is believed be ade 
quate to meet all present needs 
The vital question is how to provide for any future force 
There are 34 brigades of volunteers Of this number 3o are 
returned as having bearer companies We believe that the 
authorities would act wisely if they had these bearers in 
spected and ascertained how many would volunteer A school 
for 200 or 300 bearers might be started either in Aldershot or 
London We believe that there is no doubt that the Volun 
teer Ambulance School of Instruction could supply officers 
and noncommissioned officers for a staff of instruction should 
this be necessary A step in the direction of utilising 
the services of Volunteer bearers has already been taken 
the Secretary of State for War having sanctioned the services 
of members of the Welsh Border Brigade Volunteer Bearer 
Company for employment We learn that 37 noncommis 
sioned officers and men have accepted and will probably be 
sent to Netley and Aldershot to act as hospital orderlies 
which they will no doubt do thoroughly well as they are re 
ported to be in a high state of efficiency At the late brigade 
camp the Senior Medical Officer LieutenantColonel P Giles 
FRCS was able t0 parade for Colonel Duke RAMC the 
Principal Medical Officer of the NorthWest District not only 
a complete bearer company but a trained section of regi 
mental stretcher bearers from each of the six regiments in 
camp
