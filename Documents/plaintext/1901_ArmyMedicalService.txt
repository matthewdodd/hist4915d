ological laboratories and were doing splendid pathological 
work but he maintained that although neither Oxford nor 
Cambridge could offer the magnificent clinical opportunities 
and the enormous amount of pathological material that was 
so 
excellently managed in some of the London schools the 
older universities were still able to prepare their men to 
utilise to the full these opportunities They could instil into 
them the principles of pathology and train them in methods 
of observation and work perhaps even better than it could be 
done in the rush of the London schools where there was so 
much of clinical interest to the senior student indeed such 
a wealth of material that it might distract the junior student 
from the minute and careful study of the elements of his 
work Would it not be to the advantage of the under 
graduates that they should in university laboratories 
and in the smaller hospitals have a good foundation laid 
on which they might in larger hospitals build a solid and 
enduring superstructure  There could be no better place for 
the encouragement of the various branches of pathology than 
a university In Oxford they now had their workshop but 
they had something more they had the men to work in it 
men already trained in power of observation in scientific 
accuracy in logical methods of thought and in those broader 
philosophical systems which enabled a man to classify his 
facts and utilise them as material for scientific deduction in 
his study of pathology and medicine Thanks to such 
laboratories as the one in which they were assembled 
medicine was passing from the phase of empiric practice to 
the clearer region of scientific method Oxford had long had 
its teachers and its pupils  now she had a workshop in which 
these men might work and they might now expect even more 
and better pathological work from the Oxford School than in 
the preceding period during which they had been so active 
In concluding he ventured on behalf of the Cam 
bridge Medical School and also of those members of the 
Scottish Universities present to offer to Oxford their hearty 
congratulations on what had already been achieved by her 
great medical teachers and their best wishes for the exten 
sion and development of her active school of pathology 
The Regius Professor op Medicine Sir J Burdon 
Sanderson in moving a vote of thanks to the ViceChancellor 
for presiding said it was a happy augury that the Vice 
Chancellor was a lineal descendant of that Dr Monro to 
whose teaching the founding of the great medical school of 
Edinburgh in the middle of the eighteenth century was 
largely due 
The Master of Lincoln College seconded the motion and 
expressed the 
pleasure 
with which he and the other members 
of the University not belonging to the medical faculty had seen 
this last addition to its resources 
The ViceChancellor in briefly acknowledging the com 
pliment said that he was glad to find that the memory of his 
greatgreatgrandfather was still green 
notes on the reorganisation of the 
army Medical service 
By AMS 
Advisory BoardThere is a looseness in the wording of this 
paragraph and it is doubtful if the Committee were aware 
that surgeongenerals are officers of the Army Medical Service 
but not of the Royal Army Medical Corps It would appear 
that the two army medical officers who may be appointed to 
the Advisory Board must not hold a higher rank than that of 
colonel Thus Colonel J L Notter late Professor of Hygiene 
at Netley would be excluded on attaining his next step of 
rank now due while other surgeongenerals all specially 
selected and possessing wide knowledge of tropical disease 
would likewise be excluded 
Appointment of Civil MembersThe civilian physicians and 
surgeons are required to hold or have recently held a post on 
the acting staff of a leading civil hospital It is presumed 
therefore that they are in the enjoyment of lucrative 
practices It is apparently expected of them that for 200 a 
year they will devote much time to the public service of their 
country It is not surprising that Sir William Thomson 
enters a protest While performing duties beyond a radius 
I of four miles from Charing Cross the civil members will re 
ceive in addition to their salary outofpocket expenses i 
a day railway and cab fares is the usual rate allowed 
DutiesThe nature of the work is defined and em 
braces practically the consideration of army medical matters1 
in peace and war throughout the Empire It is not 
made clear in Paragraph 7 if the Advisory Board is 
to undertake the duties hitherto performed by the Mobilisa 
tion Committee the Army Sanitary Committee the Central 
British Red Cross Committee and the Medical Promotion 
Board All of these have representatives from the medical 
branch of the War Office The Advisory Board will consider 
all plans for new hospitals and upon standard plans for bar 
racks and standing camps which may be submitted Sub 
mitted by whom  By the InspectorGeneral of Fortifications 
or Army Sanitary Committee  A report by the Advisory 
Board is to be submitted to the Secretary of State but the 
Secretary of State is not an expert on plans and naturally he 
will refer the subject to his advisers Buildings and sites 
for camps are matters pertaining to the Quartermaster 
Generals Department and Fortification Branch but the 
QuartermasterGeneral is also ex officio President of the Army 
Sanitary Committee2 
and he may already have given approval 
to the plans submitted The QuartermasterGeneral and 
InspectorGeneral of Fortifications will therefore act first as 
pleaders and secondly as judges 
The annual inspection of each of the military hospitals by a 
subcommittee consisting of at least one military and one 
civilian member forms part of the duties It is well that 
the civil member should clearly understand what he is about 
to undertake In the various military districts in the United 
Kingdom there are 138 military hospitals ranging from 
Colchester and Cork to Inverness At the annual 
inspection 
of hospitals in the NorthWestern District the Principal 
Medical Officer used to spend more than half his days on the 
railway that record is likely to be beaten by some of the 
civilian members of the Advisory Board 
It may no doubt be advantageous in some instances to 
obtain the views of eminent civilians on army medical 
matters although their previous training and professional 
knowledge as experts on disease will not help greatly to good 
administration The main advantages which the Advisory 
Board will possess over the DirectorGeneral acting alone will 
be that its opinion as influencing public opinion is not so 
likely to be disregarded by the War Office in the future as it 
has been too often the case in the past when the Director 
Generals opinion was overridden Against that advantage 
is the delay that must occur in the performance of the current 
work of the office There will be numerous instances when 
the DirectorGeneral will be compelled to act on his own 
initiative without awaiting the consent of his colleagues on the 
Board 
It has long been advocated by the medical profession that 
the Royal Army Medical Corps should be constituted on the  
lines of the Royal Engineers Mr Brodrick knocks that idea 
on the head I wonder what would be said by Royal 
Engineer officers were the InspectorGeneral of Fortifications 
ordered to be associated with an advisory board of eminent 
civil engineers  Yet if public opinion counts for anything 
the necessity for such a course is fully as great for the Royal 
Engineers as it is for the Army Medical Service 
The present war has put an unprecedented strain upon all 
branches of the Army but criticism has been directed mainly 
to the medical side The evidence given before the South 
African Hospitals Commission was not wanting in detail and 
in the voluminous report published there is not a single 
instance of maladministration recorded against the late 
DirectorGeneral or the officers associated with him Any 
shortcomings were proved to be due to the want of appre 
ciation by the War Office officials of the advice given them 
Mr Brodrick is an adroit politician and no one knows better 
the effect of drawing a red herring across the scent 
Examinations for PromotionAs regards the examination 
for promotion there appears to be a new departure intended 
The Board of Examiners on which the English Scotch and 
Irish schools were represented were employed at the entrance1 
examination but not for promotion For the latter a London 
physician and a London surgeon examined on their par 
ticular subjects while questions regarding regulations interior 


nS mSSSSJ WATER SUPPLIES AND RIVER POLLUTION TOct 19 1Q01 
economy military law etc were framed by experienced Army 
medical officers 
Admission to the ServiceThe proposed regulations govern 
ing admissions into the service indicate little change save 
that importance will be given to a confidential report from 
the dean or other authority of a medical school In the large 
schools such as the Edinburgh School such reports are 
likely to be extremely vague as regards conduct The giving 
of commissions to civil surgeons over age who have served 
with troops in the field is a custom which existed during the 
Crimean war and has been exercised in many instances 
during the Boer war but without examination A surgeon 
who has proved his worth on active service might well have 
been excused the necessity of an examination and approval of 
the Advisory Board The conditions destroy the benefits 
intended The power formerly given to the governing bodies 
of medical schools to nominate candidates has apparently 
been withdrawn That power was never exercised save in the 
case of a dearth of candidates The nominees have been 
reported by the Netley professors as quite equal professionally 
to the average candidate received by open competition and 
superior socially It would perhaps have been more expedient 
to have awaited the success of the present scheme before 
cutting off a supply which in the present juncture has proved 
exceedingly useful 
Army Medical SchoolThe course of instruct ion at Netley fora 
surgeon on probation for the Home and for the Indian Service 
was the same and lasted four months  in future it will be for 
two months only for the Kings service It remains to be seen 
whether or not the India Office is prepared to curtail the 
length of the course at Netley for their candidates if not the 
professors will be in placed in the awkward position of having 
to deliver a complete course of lectures to one set of candi 
dates and a modified course to another Such an arrange 
ment at best will be exceedingly unsatisfactory and was only 
had recourse to during this war through the urgent need of 
personnel 
Home Surgeons and Home PhysiciansCertain inducements 
to enter the service are held out to men whilst holding a resi 
dent appointment in a recognised civil hospital but here 
again like King Charless head the examination appears 
House surgeons and physicians have neither the time nor in 
cl ination to appear for examinations and as most of them have 
been prizemen of their schools a recommendation from their 
hospitals should be considered as a sufficient guarantee of 
their worth 
Attachment to UnitsThe paragraphs having reference to 
the attachment of lieutenants to units gives no information 
regarding the period of attachment nor is it stated whether 
or not the unit is stationed at home or abroad but judging 
by paragraphs 29 and 30 it would appear that they will remain 
at home for at least three years and six months In India 
and the Colonies there are many medical officers whose tour 
of foreign service has expired and who require relief It has 
been possible during the last two years by hurrying lieute 
nants through their training to send them abroad to meet 
urgent demands That source of supply will cease India 
must get her proportion Where are they to come from 
There is I fear little hope of soon being able to spare 
officers from South Africa and after the hard work and priva 
tion incidental to war it is not probable that many will be 
physically fit to begin a fresh tour of service in India 
ReserveIt is in accordance with all experience that an 
officer having once joined the Service intends to make it his 
future career and if his services prove satisfactory he will be 
permitted by the scheme to do so or be given permission to 
retire on engaging for a period of seven years in the reserve 
receivings 
a year while so serving There is nothing to show 
that he will be permitted to resign his commission voluntarily 
That is a condition which I think few will be willing to accept 
Liability to recall will exercise a serious effect upon indi 
viduals If they purchase a practice or enter into partnership 
2 a year is a small sum to receive for undergoing the risk 
of the forfeiture of the money invested During the present 
war there have been many instances of civil surgeons who out 
of a sense of patriotism volunteered their services but sub 
sequently begged to cancel their engagements on account of 
the pecuniarv sacrifices they were making The proposed 
regulation i  likely tD prove injurious to the lieutenant and 
certain to be costly to the State without any compensating 
advantage whatever For three years and six months while 
he is preparing for his examination for promotion his services 
cannot be utilised generally He will continue to be prac 
tically a probationer while his seniors will be grilling in the 
plains of India or trekking in South Africa without a chance 
of escape except through sickness It is presumed also that 
the rules will apply to all lieutenants now serving many of 
whom are abroad If so they will have to be recalled without 
the possibility of boing relieved by others 
Examination for MajorThe examination for promotion to 
the rank of major will be attended by difficulties whenever 
the officer happens to be abroad where facilities do not exist 
for preparation Jf he be rejected twice he will be compul 
sorily retired apparently without any gratuity but it seems 
he can retire with a gratuity if he prefers to do so without 
examination 
IndiaPrevious service in India is no longer required for 
promotion to the rank of colonel and surgeongeneral This 
is an unfortunate change introduced apparently to benefit the 
medical officers of the Guards 
ConclusionFrom the foregoing it is manifest that a medical 
officers success in life will depend upon the quality of the 
examination he is capable of passing The period given 
him to attend civil hospitals is a boon but any 
one with experience of a system of examinations 
will condemn it as harassing in the highest de 
gree moreover it will prove useless for the purpose in 
tended namely to make the officer a better practitioner 
When a mans future depends upon the successful accomplish 
ment of any particular work he naturally will turn to the 
person who can help him the best and as an aid to pass an 
examination he will not be found in the hospitals but with 
the grinder besides the capacity to answer questions well is 
but a poor test of efficiency in a public service 
The scheme as drawn out is crude in the extreme and 
almost every paragraph shows the hand of the amateur in 
administration The one thing the most urgent and upon 
which every improvement every reform hangs is an increase 
of the personnel of the corps and that is not referred to 
Increase of pay will not compensate for a starved service 
CONFERENCE ON WATER SUPPLIES AND RIVER 
POLLUTION 
A Conference on Water Supplies and River Pollution 
arranged by the Sanitary Institute was opened at St Andrews 
Hall London W on Wednesday October 16th when the 
chair was taken by Professor H Robinson MInstCE in the 
absence of Sir Alexander Binnie who was unable to be present 
owing to a domestic bereavement There was a numerous 
attendance including delegates of many sanitary authorities 
A series of papers intended to serve as introductions to the 
discussions had been printed beforehand in a pamphlet and 
were taken as read 
Watershed Areas 
Mr J Parry MInstCE contributed a paper on the 
protection of watersheds in which he described the two 
methods of procedure which had been adopted on the one 
hand the sanitary regulation of watersheds by statutory 
bylaws and on the other the acquisition of the water 
sheds by the water authorities and discussed their 
relative advantages The conclusion at which he 
arrived was that if water supplies were to be effectually pro 
tected against all the risks of pollution prejudicial to health 
which modern science had revealed the sources of supply 
including the entire area over which rain was collected must 
be owned by the authority responsible for the waterworks 
and be managed solely in the interests of the water con 
sumers With regard to the question how the drainage areas 
thus acquired could be profitably utilised consistently with 
the maintenance of the high standard of purity he expressed 
the opinion that there were many uses to which such lands 
could be applied as for example sheepfarming plantations 
and deer parks that would produce some return for the outlay 
incurred in the purchase and at the same time would satisfy 
every reasonable demand as to purity
