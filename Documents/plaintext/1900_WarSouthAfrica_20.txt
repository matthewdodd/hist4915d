and the harm which may result to the patient must be very 
 great In more than one case the result of the movement 
was to precipitate a fatal issue Under the existing circum 
stances however no other course seemed possible Military 
considerations prevented our carrying the wounded on with us 
which indeed would have been almost as bad and were 
equally against leaving them behind when we moved on 
The ideal plan would have been to have sent back all 
those whom it was safe to move and leave the serious cases 
behind at a field hospital at each stopping place with the 
necessary medical and other attendants It was not however 
 considered safe to do so at Paardeberg  there would have been 
difficulty in providing food and attendance there was no 
house and tents could not be spared At Driefontein on the 
other hand though the communications with Kimberley had 
been closed and there were no empty waggons available to 
take on the wounded there was a house and tents could 
also be spared as no further fighting was expected until the 
army reached the neighbourhood of Bloemfontein This im 
possibility of transporting the patients was a very fortunate 
thing for them They were left behind with great advantage 
to their prospects of recovery 
Foon Water and Sickness 
The amount of sickness in the force during the long and 
trying march was remarkably small and probably in no other 
climate would so little harm have resulted During the day 
the heat of the sun was scorching and at first quite a number 
of men suffered more or less severely from heat stroke and 
exhaustion On the other hand in the early morning before 
dawn the cold was often great while on several nights rain fell 
and of course as no tents were carried everybody got soaked 
and did not get dry till the sun came up For the first few 
days the thirst was terrible and many who had campaigned in 
India said that the thirst here was much worse All good 
resolutions about boiling or filtering water were thrown to the 
winds  water no matter how muddy had to be got as quickly 
as possible For some time we were on half rations and the 
fresh meat was often so tough as to be quite uneatable On 
several occasions where the marches were lcng the convoys 
did not arrive till late or not at all so that even the half 
rations were not obtainable The man therefore who had 
not taken the precaution of carrying something in his saddle 
bags had to go supperless to bed To bed is rather a 
euphemistic expression for when the baggage did not come 
in bedsimply meant lying down on the veld without 
covering of any kind And yet in spite of all this after 
a few weakly members had been weeded out in the early 
period the health of the troops was excellent 
The main trouble and one from which almost all the 
force has suffered at one time or another has been diar 
rhoea or as it has come to be more elegantly called 
Modders or Riets according to the river water which 
was being drunk and according to the severity of the case 
the former being considered more severe than the latter 
In some cases it has been so severe as to necessitate the 
admission of the patients to the field hospitals or even their 
return to the base In the great majority of cases however 
the trouble has been slight and easily controlled and was 
probably due either to salines dissolved in the water or to the 
irritating effect of the mud Since our arrival in Bloem 
fontein enteric fever is making its appearance among the 
troops The disease was probably contracted at Paardeberg  
indeed considering the state of the Modder River at that 
camp produced by the waste from Cronjes laager above ano 
the impossibility of preventing the troops using that water 
it is surprising that the result was not much more serious

It may perhaps be of most interest to your readers if I give 
a short account of the march from February 12th when Lord

THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE MARCH FROM MODDER RIVER TO 
BLOEMFONTEIN 
By W Watson Cheyne FRS FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force South Africa 
Bloemfontein April 1900 
A short account of Lord Robertss great march from Modder 
River to Bloemfontein may be of interest to readers of the 
British Medical Journal more especially as it illustrates 
the difficulties attending the treatment of the wounded under 
conditions different from those encountered during the 
earlier operations of this war 
Before this march began the various actions had taken place 
in close proximity to a railway line on which admirablyfitted 
hospital trains were at hand to carry off the wounded with com 
paratively little disturbance and lodge them in wellappointed 
stationary hospitals within a short time Indeed in such 
places as Modder River the field hospitals were able to 
accommodate the more seriously wounded till such time as it 
was safe to move themin fact they more resembled 
stationary hospitals Further there was ample transport 
from the field of battle and only a short distance for the 
wounded to travel  hence they were rapidly collected and 
quickly lodged in tents where they could remain till it was 
safe to send them to the base 
Difficulties of Transport 
The conditions on this march were very different In the 
first place as a matter of military necessity it was con 
sidered essential to cut down the number of ambulances 
with each division from the normal number of ten to 
two The possibility that very serious difficulty and delay 
in collecting the wounded from the battlefields might 
result from this decision was repeatedly and emphati 
cally pointed out to the military authorities by the medi 
cal department but without avail The justice of this 
warning was fully borne out at the battle of Driefontein 
Not only was the number of the ambulances cut down but all 
the other equipment tents etc had also to be reduced and 
as a result many of the wounded more especially at Paarde 
berg had to bivouac under the shade of the trees where 
available or failing themand there are no trees in this 
country except along the river beds and around farmhouses 
under temporary shelters made with blankets This diminution 
of baggage affected all the arrangements  for example it was 
often impossible to get boiled water mainly because owing to 
the small number of kettles carried all were required for 
cooking In part however this was due also to the difficulty 
of getting fuel and to the small amount of water obtainable 
Such water as could be got was not only small in quantity 
but often extremely muddy so that the ordinary charcoal filter 
did not clear it properly and very soon became so choked up 
that the water ran through very slowly  for the latter reason 
the Berkefeld and similar filters were of very little use 
In some of the field hospitals operations had to be doean the 
open as the operating tent was required for the serious cases 
and if a dust storm came on in the middle of the operation 
the conditions as regards asepsis were by no means Ideal 
At Paardeberg antiseptic dressings ran out at one of the 
hospitals but I was able to tide over this difficulty because 
owing to the generosity of Lord Lister I had with me some 
double cyanide powder with which we were able toimpregnate 
sufficient material 
In this march as has been said we were away from a railway 
the distance from the base increasing day by day Yet the eick 
and wounded had to be sent back  they could not be left on 
the veld It is a very different thing to transport wounded a 
short distance to a comfortable ambulance train well supplied 
with every convenience from putting them into buck or ox 
waggons and sending them for two three or in the case of 
Poplar Grove four days journey over the veld with no roads 
in springless carts without suitable protection from the sun 
or rain and without the comfort which a recentlywounded 
man requires The agony which must be endured under such 
circumstances by many cases such as compound fractures

MODDER RIVER TO 
BLOEMFONTEINMay

12th early we left Modder River by train for Enslin and sub 
eequently rode to Ramdam in Free State territory a distance 
of about 12 miles Thence we went next day February 
13th to De Kiels Drift on the following day to Watervai 
Drift on Thursday February 15th to Wegdraai and on 
Friday to Jacobsdal This completed the first part of the 
expeditiont and during this time General Frenchs division 
had preceded us and entered Kimberley and General Kelly 
Kennys division had followed more slowly in his tracks This 
was in most respects the most trying part of the march The heat 
during the day was very great and on rthe first and second 
days especially led to a considerable number of men falling 
out from fatigue and heat stroke and some 60 had to be sent 
back Beyond some scrub there was no vegetation and the 
passage of large numbers of troops and the enormous lines of 
transport stirred up the dust so that dust storms were 
frequent Further the convoy arrived very late on the first 
day especially and those unaccustomed to this sort of cam 
paigning and unprovided with food in their saddlebags had 
to go without 
From a surgical point of view there was little of importance 
during this part of the march On arriving at De Kiels Drift on 
the Tuesday February 13th we found that General French 
had had a slight engagement on the previous evening and 
that four wounded had been left behind With the exception 
of a little bugler boy who was wounded in the foota per 
forating wound through the front part of the footwhile 
running up the river bank as he said to get a shot at the 
Boers the cases were not serious The next wounded with 
whom we had to deal were at Wegdraai on Thursday Feb 
ruary 15th A small fight took place between there and 
Jacobsdal in which a few were wounded while some 
others were brought in from Watervai Drift We had left 
that drift about 5 am on Thursday morning and after the 
army had gone on a considerable force of Boers attacked the 
rear part of the convoy which had not yet moved on and 
captured a considerable number of waggons About 16 
wounded were brought in and treated early on Friday 
morning February 16th With one or two exceptions how 
ever the wounds were comparatively slight and the wounded 
were taken on to Jacobsdal in the afternoon and sent to 
Modder River 
The German Ambulance 
At Jacobsdal we visited the German ambulance meeting 
Drs Kettner and Hildebrand assistants of Professors Bruns 
and Esmarch They very kindly showed us all their arrange 
ments and cases many of the latter being of considerable 
interest Their hospital was established chiefly in the school 
buildings and was very completely fitted out A large pro 
portion of the wounds were from shrapnel and as opposed 
to the experience on the English side they told us that they 
had only met with a small proportion of bullet wounds Con 
sequently the skin wounds were frequently large and in a 
considerable proportion suppuration was going onindeed 
had already begun when they were admitted The experi 
ence of the surgeons to this ambulance in abdominal wounds 
was not very good but on the whole they were inclined to 
leave them alone in the first instance at any rate They 
had not had a large number of wounded After the battle 
of Magersfontein they had about 100 
Paardeberg 
We left Jacobsdal onfthe morning of Monday February 19th 
at 4 am and rode through to Paardeberg a distance of about 
twentyseven miles with a halt of two hours at Klip Kraal 
drift On arriving there about 1 pm we found an action going 
on chiefly artillery and heard that a big fight had taken place 
on the previous day in which over 800 had been wounded In 
the evening we took up our quarters on the banks of the 
Modder River about three miles below Cronjes laager and 
in the immediate neighbourhood of the two field hospitals of 
the Sixth Division under Majors Pike and Ford respectively one of the fierd hospitals of the Ninth Division under Major 
Murray and the Australian field hospital under Major 
Fiaschi  the other field hospital of the Ninth Division under 
Major Sawyer was at a drift about a mile further down the 
river During the previous days fight the field hospitals had 
been shelled by the Boers without however anyone being 
hurt but they had had to shift their quarters As the result of 
the battle the Boers had retired higher up the river the banks 
of which at this part were pretty high but sloping and lined 
with small trees acacias etc The hospital tents were 
pitched just above the banks of the river where there were 
fortunately also some larger trees which gave shade to those 
patients who could not be accommodated in tents We bivou 
acked halfway down the bank and might have been picnick 
ing on the banks of the Thames but for the occasional booming 
of big guns and the rattle of rifles 
Below Cronjes Laager 
The water of the Modder was as its name Mud River im 
plies thick with mud and foul smelling from the dead ani 
mals and refuse from Cronjes laager Water bottles containing 
it when opened frequently went off with a pop and the gas 
which escaped was of a distinctly disagreeable odour Hence 
as far as possible drinking water was brought in the water 
carts from a farm about five miles away There was not 
enough of this drinking water however bo spare for surgical 
purposes so that the only supply available was from the river 
while owing to the small number of kettles it was impossible 
to get a sufficient quantity boiled The plain around the camp 
very soon became a sandy desert so that the air was always 
full of dust and dust storms were frequent For some days 
the number of the wounded was so great that the operating 
tent in one of the field hospitals had to be utilised for the 
patients and operations had to be undertaken in the open 
Although the greater number of the patients were those 
wounded in the fight of February 18th still a few came in every 
day either as the result of small fights with those trying to 
relieve Cronje or as the result of sniping 
During our stay at Paardeberg the weather was fairly good 
but on two nights there was much rain On Saturday Feb 
ruary 24th and during the night it rained heavily and the 
river rose considerably with the result that during the whole 
of Sunday there was a constant procession down the stream of 
dead and putrid horses and other animals from the Boer 
camp Several hundreds were counted and as a rule as 
many as fifteen or twenty were to be seen at one time 
The stench from these animals was very bad espe 
cially if they happened to be temporarily arrested by 
branches of trees and so on Hence the greatest care 
had to be exercised in the sanitation of the camp and it 
says a great deal for the arrangements adopted that no 
illness except the everpresent 
 
Modders developed It was 
however impossible to prevent the men drinking the river 
water  and that is I believe the source of the considerable 
number of cases of enteric fever which have developed since 
our arrival at Bloemfontein Indeed the state of the river 
was so bad that the removal of the camp had become a neces 
sity when the brilliant attack of the Canadians during the 
early morning of February 27th fortunately brought Cronjes 
dogged resistance to an end 
Arove Cronjes Laager 
Above the laager the conditions were verydifferent There 
the water was good though muddy the veld had not yet 
become trodden down and the troops stationed there were in 
good condition Since our arrival here the number of cases of 
enteric fever developing among these troops has been quite 
small In company with Major Bond RAMC I rode over 
on February 23rd to the part of the field hospital of the 
Seventh Division under Major Franklin which was located on 
the banks of the river about two miles above the laager and 
saw several interesting cases The camp was very pleasantly 
situated on the banks of the river and the wounded were 
doing well and were as indeed was the case in all the field 
hospitals excellently looked after 
In Cronjes Laager 
On the morning of Tuesday February 27th after Cronje 
had come in Colonel Stevenson Major Sylvester RAMC 
his secretary and I rode out to the Boer laager to see what 
assistance was necessary for the Boer wounded The laager 
presented an appalling picture of devastation and the 
stench was frightful Dead animals in all stages of decomposi 
tion were lying about everywhere  a house close to the drift 
in which a large number of horses had been stabled had had 
its gable blown in and was full of dead horses The greater

number of the waggons were in ruins some overturned some 
more or less completely burnt while others were represented 
by a mass of broken wood and iron The ground around was 
pitted and yellow from the lyddite shells and strewn with 
fragments of shell shrapnel broken carts and all sorts of i 
dbris The laager 
was in most parts 
surrounded by 
trenches or 
rather rifle pits 
each holding one 
or two men and 
completely shel 
tering them The 
banks of the river 
were full of deep 
burrows in which 
the men had lain 
and in which the 
wounded were 
found 
So well concealed 
were these bur 
rows that it was 
only after repeated 
search that one 
could be sure that 
all the wounded 
had been found  
their condition 
was lamentable in 
the extreme Their 
doctors and am 
bulances had left 
them and gone in 
to Jacobsdal when 
the flight from Grey College Bloemfontein 
Magersfontein took place The wounded had been lying in 
the foul laager without medical attendance or dressings of 
any kind and as a consequence the wounds were very foul 
and many of the patients were in a deplorable condition from 
sepsis The septic state of the wounds is very well illustrated 
by the fact that 
next day while we 
were again out at 
the place where 
the Boer wounded 
had been collected 
secondary haemor 
rhage occurred in 
two cases and 
would bave proved 
fatal had we not 
happened to be on 
the spot 
Cronjes resist 
ance for so long a 
period may possi 
bly indicate bra 
very but his in 
humanity in keep 
ing his men for 
days in this death 
trap long after it 
was fully evident 
that escape was im 
possible and in 
opposition to the 
wishes of the great 
majority of his fol 
lowers cannot be

matters Lord Roberls several days before the surrender 
offered to take over the wounded and have them carefully 
attended to and when Cronje refused that he offered 
to send in medical men to dress the wounds and attend 
to the patients This offer was also refused by Cronje un 
less the medical men stayed with him altogether a condi 
tion to which Lord Roberts naturally could not accede Lord 
Robertss humanity was also strikingly illustrated by the way 
in which he limited his offensive operations to what was 
necessary to keep up pressure and convince Cronje of the 
hopelessness of his 
case without des 
troying more lives 
than could possi 
bly be avoided 
Having collected 
the wounded of 
which we counted 
159 a few more 
were subsequently 
discovered and 
dressings having 
been applied by 
several members 
of the Royal Army 
Medical Corps who 
had come out they 
were carried across 
the drift on 
stretchers for the 
water was too deep 
for ambulance wag 
gons to cross and 
were deposited on 
the river bank in 
a nice shady spot 
about a quarter of 
a mile higher up 
the river Two of 
the Boer doctors 
having in the 
meantime arrived 
from Jacobsdal they were provided with dressings food and 
such covering as could be spared and the wounded were 
handed over to their charge I fear that there was not very 
much done for them however in the surgical way for several 
casessuch as eancrenereauirinc immediate operation were 
left alone A few 
days later some of 
the patients were 
sent back to the 
German Hospital 
at Jacobsdal and 
the majority to the 
hospitals at Kim 
berfey 
The Action at 
Poplar Grove 
We stayed in the 
camp at Paarde 
berg till March ist 
Then we moved 
on about five miles 
to Ossfontein 
where there was a 
farmhouse and 
where we remained 
for a few days to 
allow the horses to 
recruit and to get 
up supplies As 
transport became 
available the sick 
and wounded were 
sent back to Mod 
der River and later 
to Kimberley in 
detachments so 
that it was not necessary to take any on to Ossfontein 
On the morning of March 8th we left Ossfontein The Boers 
who were in large force in the immediate vicinity were 
attacked and after some hours completely driven back with 
very little loss on our side In fact with the exception of

HOSPITALSMay

some of the mounted troops who had about twenty men 
wounded at Poplar Grove where the last stand of the Boers 
was made there were no losses The army bivouacked at 
Poplar Grove that evening and most of the troops remained 
there till March ioth Of the wounded 6 were serious cases  
i head case which I trephined 2 compound fractures and 
 
abdominal cases All but the 3 abdominal cases were sent 
ack to Kimberley on March 9th but it was thought best to 
take on the latter with us for one days journey and keep them 
under observation rather than to send them back four days 
journey to Kimberley 
The Battle of Driefontein 
On March 10th we moved to Driefontein where the Boers 
were again met with in force and where another battle was 
fought which resulted in their utter rout and the clearing of 
the road to Bloemfontein In this battle we had about 400 
wounded and it was here that the deficiency of ambulances 
became most evident The greater number of the men were 
wounded on a ridge in front of the camp and fell to the lot 
of the field hospitals of the Sixth Division especially to Major 
Pikes The action was not over till dark and though assist 
ance was obtained from other bearer companies the wounded 
were not all found and collected till well on in the night 
Only 4 ambulances were available for carrying them to 
the field hospital and as the distance was considerable 
and as each ambulance only takes 2 lyingdown cases and 
4 sitting up it may be readily understood that a good 
many hours elapsed before all the wounded were got to the 
hospital In fact next morning about 11 when Lord 
Roberts was riding over the battlefield on his way to the 
next stopping place he came on a group of wounded 
who had been collected but had not yet been removed As 
a consequence probably of this incident he has ordered up 
the rest of the ambulances and has issued an order in which 
he states that as under the system necessary on this march 
such delay was unavoidable he desires that should similar 
circumstances arise in future help should be afforded to the 
R AMC in collecting and bringing in the wounded by 
fatigue parties sent by the officers commanding the regi 
ments and corps to which the wounded belong 
As transport was not available to take these patients 
on with us and as the communications with Kimberley 
were no longer kept open it became necessary to leave 
the patients behind The field hospital was therefore 
moved down to a farmhouse in the valley and left there 
with supplies and medical attendance Thus although the 
patients had to be moved about two miles on March nth 
they were spared the long journey in buck and ambulance 
waggons till some days after the injury This absence of 
transport was I believe a very fortunate thing for the 
patients Wherever possible the severely wounded should 
be left in the field hospitals for some days and not hurried 
back to the base On March 16th waggons were despatched 
to bring in the wounded to Bloemfontein three days jour 
ney and at the same time Colonel Stevenson sent word to 
Major Pike telling him to use his discretion about sending on 
his patients and advising him to keep back the serious cases 
This advice was acted on and they followed a week later 
The further three days march and entry of the army into 
Bloemfontein on March 13th has already no doubt been fully 
recorded in the newspapers and I need not describe them 
The Work of the RAMC 
In my next letter I shall make some remarks about the pro 
gress of the wounds but before going any further I may here 
express my opinion that under the difficult circumstances which 
I have fully referred to the work of the RAMC is deserving 
of the greatest praise The task with which Colonel Steven 
son had to cope of carrying out the medical arrangements of 
this large force more especially the temporary accommodation 
and transport of the sick with very insufficient materialswas 
done without a hitch while each individual member of the 
RAMC strove not only to do his best for the sick and 
wounded but also to add to the reputation for efficiency which 
the Corps has already deservedly won in this campaign 
Attention is now being directed to the lessonstaught on this 
march and in the further course of the campaign an attempt 
will be made to overcome the difficulties as regards water for 
surgical purposes dressings etc to which reference has 
already been made 
Bloemfontein 
Bloemfontein is a pretty town of about 6000 inhabitants 
lying in a hollow at the base of kopjes which rise highest on 
the north while a plain stretches out from it for miles east 
wards the streets are wide the houses onestoreyed and sur 
rounded by trees and there is no drainage system earth 
closets being everywhere adopted The water supply consists 
in part of rain water every house being provided with large 
tanks for its collection in part of well water and in part of 
water recently brought from the Modder River from a dis 
tance of about 22 miles The town is very healthy with the 
exception of enteric fever which seems to be endemic in most 
South African towns Its origin here is difficult to trace Of 
water the well water is that to which the disease is most often 
ascribed but I cannot but think that the dust and flies have 
much to do with its persistence and spread 
Improvised Hospitals 
Bloemfontein has a considerable number of public buildings 
more especially schools  it is indeed the chief educational 
centre for the Free State At the present time these schools 
naturally enough are empty and they as well as some other 
public buildings have been taken over for hospitals by Colonel 
Stevenson In one week Colonel Stevenson and his Secretary 
Major Sylvester took over fitted up and fully equipped with 
medical and nursing staffs buildings holding in all 510 beds 
The buildings taken over so far are St Michaels Home and 
Cottage Hospital a large girls boarding school carried on by 
I Anglican Sisters  here 100 beds have been established and 
the nursing is being done by the Sisters of the home and by 
the RAMC orderlies The Dames Institute another 
large boarding and day school for girls has also been in part 
taken up and fitted with 150 beds Grey College the 
advanced school and college of the State which was 
founded by Sir George Grey provides 100 beds The old Free 
State barracks have also been converted into a hospital with 
100 beds The Convent furnishes 60 beds and the industrial 
homea school for boyshas 50 beds All these institutions 
were in full working order and full of patients ten days after 
our arrival here the patients being partly sick from the 
troops around and partly the wounded brought up from 
Driefontein The work involved in doing all this will be 
readily appreciated by those acquainted with hospital 
organisation Further accommodation has now been pro 
vided in the Raadszaal Parliament House which has been 
 turned into a stationary hospitalof100 beds and as soon as 
the railway is in working order No 5 Stationary Field Hos 
pital with 510 beds and the Portland Irish and Langman 
Hospitals will come up In fact it is probable that Bloem 
fontein will now become the hospital base instead of Cape 
town as the weather at Capetown in winter is cold and wet 
and not at all agreeable while here it is dry and healthy

Hospital Arrangements at Bloemfontein 
Arrangements are being rapidly made to constitute Bloem 
fontein an advanced medical base No 8 General left here 
last week by sea via East London the Portland is under 
orders to follow Four buildings have so far been taken over 
at Bloemfontein for hospital purposes  the Dames Institute 
the Grey College St Michaels Home and the Industrial 
Institute The Dames Institute is the principal girls high 
school of the Free State and the Grey College a similar 
institution for boys Both are fine wellbuilt structures 
with spacious dormitories and class rooms and an abundance 
of smaller rooms The latter especially might have been 
built for hospital purposes The Dames Institute is made up 
to about 150 beds and the other three to about 100 but with 
out any difficulty St Michaels and the Grey College could 
each take another 50 Adjoining St Michaels which is a 
Church of England institution partly a girls school and 
partly a home for waif a and strays carried on by the All 
Saints Sisters is the Bloemfontein Cottage Hospital also 
under the management of the Sisters This was until a few

years ago the only hospital in Bloemfontein It is now 
being used for officers It has about a dozen beds The 
magnificent Raad Zaal or Parliament House is also being 
taken over for hospital purposes but is not yet equipped 
Besides these buildings the large and very well fitted Yolks 
Hospital is being utilised and there are several field hespitals 
under canvas It is evident that there need be no lack of 
suitable accommodation at Bloemfontein Supplies are a 
little short still owing to the insuperable difficulty of getting 
things up in sufficient quantity by railways crippled with 
broken bridges and overweighted with work but the military 
medical authorities are doing their level best to overcome 
difficulties Colonel Stevenson who is now Principal 
Medical Officer of Lord Robertss force is on the spot 
and directing all arrangements assisted by Major Sylvester 
who has been withdrawn from Wynberg to return to his old 
post as Colonel Stevensons secretary Two more capable 
organisers hardly exist in the army Nursing sisters of No 9 
have already gone to Bloemfontein and the whole hospital is 
to follow 
An advance Medical Stores Depot has been established at 
Bloemfontein under Captain Connor RAMC and the Red 
Cross Society is following up the troops most energetically 
Lady Edward Cecil and Lady Charles Bentinck have just 
gone up to Bloemfontein in order to personally supervise the 
supply of comforts and with a view to meeting the altered 
conditions of the campaign which will henceforth be carried 
on very much apart from the railways  they have taken up 
two Red Cross waggons which will be used to carry comforts 
to the isolated field hospitals 
Enteric Fever 
Enteric fever is frightfully prevalent everywhere No 6 at 
Nauuwpoort is almost a typhoid hospital and the same is to 
be said of the station hospitals At No 1 about twothirds of 
the medical cases are of this disease at No 5 fully half and 
the proportions elsewhere are somewhat similar At Kim 
berley the hospitals are almost enteric wards  and yet 
curiously enough there is still a comparative absence of 
dysentery There have been only a moderate number even 
in the field hospitals and at the base very few indeed the 
latter fact proving that even the cases at the front must be 
of a mild character or they would have found their way down 
here as dysentery cases form a class which are invariably 
cleared out of field hospitals whenever they assume a chronic 
character Most of the cases have done remarkably well and 
the majority have gone back to duty in a few weeks 
Sickness at Kimberley 
The Canadian Red Cross Society has the direction of affairs 
at Kimberley where there are four hospitals accommodating 
a thousand patients and nearly full Enteric fever is again 
the staple there and the results are appallingly bad probably 
owing to the utterly brokendown condition of the men who 
have had to face the disease after a course of starvation during 
the siege The Cape Police are suffering very severely One 
enteric ward in the Kimberley Hospital civil is almost 
entirely occupied by them and I am informed that for a week 
or two they had about one death a day out of some 40 beds 
Another factor accountable for the bad results is the difficulty 
of obtaining sufficient fresh milk Nobody can help this 
Milk cannot be got  but its absence is sorely detrimental to 
enterics At Bloemfontein a fair supply of milk was obtained 
locally almost at once The farmers there had of course not 
been harried as was the case at Kimberley Too much praise 
cannot be given to the medical authorities for the rapid way 
in which they are getting things into shape at both these 
places 
THE IRISH FIELD HOSPITAL WORK 
By Sir William Thomson 
SurgeoninChief Irish Hospital Field Force South Africa 
Naauwpoort April 2nd 
The Prieska Expedition 
I mentioned in a former letter that in obedience to a telegram from Lord Kitchener I despatched a section of the Field 
Hospital to De Aar on March 1 ith under the command of Dr 
George Stoker With him were Dr Friel with Dr Counihan 
and Mr Macllwaine as dressers a ward master 18 orderlies 
with io Cape boys the equipment consisting of 6 waggons 
2 Scotch carts i water cart 66 mules and 4 ponies Dr 
Stoker reports to me that they arrived at De Aaron March 
12th at 1 am The column which they were to accompany 
consisted of 2000 men The hospital started on March 15th 
The first march was to Britstown thirtyone miles At 
5 oclock on March 16th they were ordered to push on being the 
only field hospital available andthey reached Upwater at 
2 am on St Patricks Day Here there were many casualties 
and sick to deal with Ten bad cases were sent back to a 
stationary hospital at Britstown under charge of Mr 
Macllwaine and Wardmaster Hamilton A small hospital 
was established at Upwater in a farmhouse and 19 cases were 
left there under charge of Dr Counihan The hospital con 
tinued its course through Dornbergsfontein and Karabeek 
attending to the sick and injured there and on March 21st 
Prieska was reached On the way Dr Friel and the Hon 
Rupert Guinness went out some miles with a stretcher and 
Cape cart and brought back an injured man safely 
On the return journey DrStoker was appointed SMO 
with instructions to evacuate all the sick and injured from 
various places De Aar was reached on March 27th The 
work was most arduous The rain fell in torrents for three 
consecutive days as well as at intervals and clothing and 
bedding were drenched Thestaff never slept in a tent The 
entire march was 238 miles The number of cases under 
treatment was 202 and 56 weretransported by wagons Dr 
Stoker states that the commissariat department was beyond 
praise 
In a report on the medical aspects7of theexpedition Dr 
Friel says the water was bad It was filtered or boiled and 
tea was the safest drink What struck him as one of the try 
ing conditions for the soldiers was that they had to start 
on a hard days work with an insufficient breakfast The 
hospital staff rose early and had a warm meal before starting 
and to this he attributes the fact that they all came through 
the work in excellent health There were all degrees of 
diarrhoea as regards the severity of the accompanying 
pain the frequency of the motions and the passage of 
blood or not Some of the dysenteric cases were in 
a most pitiable condition from exhaustion and want of sleep 
Lead and opium were most frequently given and acted well 
in many cases There was no death Patients when first 
seen were given boiled milk and bovril preferably the former 
Cases treated thus in the early stages rapidly improved and 
returned to duty The patients from the regular army were 
not nearly so numerous as from the Yeomanry and other 
volunteer corps Some cases of typhoid and of fractured skull 
were placed in hospital at De Aar He cannot point to any 
single circumstance as a cause of the diarrhoea It seemed 
to be caused by a combination of overwork exposure to the 
sun chills from sleeping in wet clothes unsuitable food and 
impure water He recommends the early treatment of these 
cases to consist of condensed milk and bovril with some 
selected medicine 
The work done by the hospital was excellent under the 
most trying circumstances and I am glad to be able to send 
you a copy of the following letter which I have received from 
Lord Kitchener 
De Aar March 27th 1000 
Dear Sir WilliamI am sure you will be glad to hear that the Irish 
ambulances did most excellent work with the column that marched to 
Prieska and back They proved themselves thoroughly efficient in every 
way and though we had more cases than I anticipated owing to very wet 
weather they showed themselves quite equal to the occasion I have 
been most pleased at the willing way in which all hands worked the whole 
time under Dr StokerYours sincerely 
Kitchener 
Firing on Hospitals 
Before I left home I had read on many occasions of the 
firing on hospitals in camp or on the field by the Boers 
These reports gave rise to natural indignation as a piece of 
wanton savagery I have no means of knowing of course 
how far these actions were deliberate But since I have been 
here  have come to understand how a hospital may be shelled 
by an enemy in utter ignorance of what it really is The 
truth is that under certain circumstances the Geneva Red 
Cross is useless as a protection This morning was hot and 
still There was hardly a sign of motion in the air I said to 
 a distinguished officer 
 If this camp were attacked by the 


ic98 MiSlBSSSSj SURGICAL NOTES FROM SOUTH AFRICA  May 5 1900 
enemy now how could they identify your hospital  Oh 
he said 
  we have our Red Cross flags up I asked Where  
He answered 
 
There and there and there 
 
Oh yes I 
said 
 
they are up but who could see them at a thousand 
yards off And I pointed out that the flags were lying 
motionless along the flagstaff in folds Now days like this are 
not uncommon in South Africa at all events and I there 
fore understand how an enemy could send shell after shell 
into a hospital camp under the belief that he was attacking 
a combatant portion of the army The Red Cross i 9 not made 
a sufficiently distinctive feature On the waggons it is quite 
too small and it is not recognisable at a comparatively short 
distance 
I suggest that every marquee and bell tent used for hos 
pital purposes should have a very large Red Cross on the roof 
and sides repeated on various aspects and made as obvious 
as possible At present the enemy only sees a group of tents 
which are precisely like those used by the fighting men and 
if the wind is not sufficient to extend the flag there is nothing 
to tell him that he is firing on a crowd of sick and wounded 
men In every case there ought to be a light canvas in a wire 
frame bearing a large Red Cross which could be hoisted 
instead of the flag when that is useless There would be no 
difficulty about this It would enable a hospital to have the 
protection which it has not at present and we should hear 
less of outrages against the Geneva Convention The Red 
Cross is on easy chairs and buckets and boxes of dressings 
but it is not exhibited as it ought to be in all places where it 
is most required I have tested my opinion as to the useless 
ness of the flag as a sign in calm weather I am able to 
declare that although I knew the exact place to look for the 
flagposts the flags themselves were absolutely indistinguish 
able at 200 yards I could see the thickening at the top of the 
poles formed by the limp folds of the flags but nothing more 
There was no Red Cross visible from end to end of the camp 
although the flags were duly hoisted But nowadays rifle fire 
is effective at more than 2000 yards and when we come to 
big guns we are dealing with ranges counting miles Even a 
careful search with a telescope would not in the absence of 
wind enable anyone to identify the hospital The dimen 
sions of the Red Cross badge were decided on years ago 
before the days of the smallbore rifle They are quite inade 
quate now I have called attention to this matter because I 
have seen the system at work and have noted its defects A 
prompt remedy is needed on the lines which I have suggested 
for the matter is of the first importance to every civilised 
nation concerned in the operations of war 
SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOS 
PITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
From our Special War Correspondent 
Capetoion March 20th 1900 
SECOND THOUGHTSCowiiwwea 
So many of the wounded who are either convalescent or 
rendered unfit for active service have now been sent home that 
the sight of wounds from Mauser bullets must be almost as 
familiar at home as it is out here Among the cases invalided 
are not a few likely to need further treatment in some in 
stances in the form of operation The occasion therefore may 
be appropriate for reviewing the surgical experience of the 
past few months with regard to the treatment of the various 
classes of injuries 
Abdominal Injuries 
In previous letters little mention has been made of the 
operative treatment of abdominal injuries It seemed wiser 
to wait until a fair amount of evidence had been collectedand 
until the opinions of the bulk of those who could furnish in 
formation of value could be got together Many hoped at the 
outset of the war that the opportunity had at last arisen for 
showing that abdominal surgery could extend its sphere of 
usefulness into a new and hitherto almost unexplored field 
Great hopes were built on the experience of the last twenty 
years work in this branch of surgery and not a few probably 
looked forward with more interest to the results of the opera 
tive treatment of abdominal injuries than to any other depart 
ment of surgery in the field Intestinal surgery has of late 
made such advances and so much attention is paid to it by 
all operating surgeons that it did not appear too sanguine to 
imagine that a perfect revolution was likely to be effected in 
the treatment of this formidable class of cases 
Possibly some such revolution has really come about though 
hardly in the way or in the direction that was anticipated I 
do not think I am exaggerating in the leastand I fancy 
opinion is in reality tolerably unanimous in the matterwhen 
I say that the results actually obtained up to the present are 
in a sense of the most disappointing nature It is true that 
the proportion of patients who have recovered from penetrat 
ing gunshot wounds of the abdomen is much larger than in 
any previous campaign That much may be safely asserted 
although statistics with regard to the present campaign are 
not yet available and works of reference relating to military 
surgery in the past are not readily accessible here  but these 
fortunate patients have not been saved by operation So few 
indeed have recovered after laparotomy and so many with 
obviously grave abdominal injuries have recovered without 
being submitted to any operation at all that it is at least 
questionable whether the better practice is not to leave this 
class of injuries alone altogether as far as operation is con 
cerned 
We hear much and probably shall continue to hear much 
of the occasional cases that have recovered after suture of per 
forations or excision of lengths of intestine But these rare 
successes must not blind us to the absolute facts The per 
centage of mortality after laparotomy for gunshot wounds of 
the abdomen will certainly when the figures come to be pub 
lished be shown to be appallingly large The percentage of 
recoveries when the patients have been left untouched will be 
strikingly great when compared with previous records Were 
it not for the latter fact we should of course be disposed to 
think that with further experience and by so modifying proce 
dure as to meet more effectively the special conditions better 
results might be obtained Possibly this is true but it would 
still be a question whether laparotomy save in the most ex 
ceptional instances is good practice or even justifiable surgery 
One of the German surgeons sent out to study gunshot 
wounds in this way is said to have remarked that abdominal 
surgery in war was pure 
 
phantasy Others had previously 
and more have since come to much the same conclusion 
The Time Factors 
Several points must be borne in mind in this connection 
One is that in the cases operated on the laparotomy has for 
the most part been performed under the most unfavourable 
conditions Time is a factor of the first importance The 
patient may have been lying out for some hours before being 
picked up by the stretcherbearers A further delay follow 
before he is brought into the field hospital If an isolated 
case he might be there attended to immediately but it is 
almost certain that under the only conditions in which a field 
hospital is likely to be near at hand an engagement is going 
on and he finds himself one of many who require treatment 
The work in the field hospitals is got through swiftly enough 
but it is obvious that many patients must justly take pre 
cedence of a case requiring an operation of a very protracted 
nature and for which somewhat extensive preparations have 
to be made Cases for example of haemorrhage or fracture 
must be attended to first for it is of prime import 
ance to clear the field hospital as rapidly as possible 
Hours may elapse therefore when the patient is ac 
tually in the field hospital before his turn comes and 
these are hours of hard work for the surgeons and for the 
orderlies At the end of this time when the inrush of 
wounded is over for the day the most indefatigable surgeon 
would hardly feel that he was justified in commencing an 
operation that may last an hour or more even if he considers 
that with the means and assistance at hand he is justified in 
undertaking it at all The condition of the patient may possibly 
settle the question and the surgeon has to choose between 
operating on a patient suffering more or less profoundly from 
shock or allowing the precious hours to slip away if operation 
is likely to be of real benefit For the most part then the 
question is settled in one way and the patient is transferred 
back to the nearest suitable stationary or base hospital 
Usually from fortyeight to seventytwo hours have elapsed 
after the reception of the wound before the laparotomy can be 
performed It is obvious of course that under the best

NOTES FROM SOUTH 
AFRICAmwS iQ99 
imaginable conditions the surroundings and the provisions 
for asepsis must be less complete and perfect in a 
field than in a base or stationary hospital The 
latter in the present campaign is as I have re 
peatedly urged much less of a disadvantage than might be 
supposed The onlooker with his critical faculties com 
pletely in abeyance who is familiar with surgical work in 
London or in large cities will not be profoundly im 
pressed with the standard of asepsis aimed at or the precau 
tions thought necessary to reach that standard by either the 
nurses or orderlies working in the military hospitals The 
surgeon whose lines are cast in places where the climatic 
conditions and the pure air do not do so much for him as in 
South Africa and who has learnt by sad experience how much 
depends on the most rigid observance by everyone concerned 
in an operation or dressing of details calculated to secure asep 
sis would probably be horrorstruck at much of what he would 
see done by orderlies and nurses for the most part in their 
surgical work It is worse than idle to point to results and to 
assert as can be asserted with truth that there has been no 
case of pyaemia erysipelas tetanus hospital gangrene or 
the like The next war in which England is engaged may not 
be fought in South Africa or in the Soudan But the same 
assistants may be called upon to do the same work 
Amidst unfavourable surroundings unless far more stringent 
precautions are taken than are as a rule observed in the mili 
tary hospitals in South Africa their deficiencies will be found 
out and these grim enemies of the surgeon will once again 
as in times past work havoc The nurse and the orderly are 
links in the antiseptic chain Unless they are as rigidly careful 
as anyone else concerned as the operator and his immediate 
assistants the continuity is interrupted and the patient 
suffers 
It must not be supposed that I am arguing that for abdo 
minal cases special antiseptic precautions are necessary As 
a matter of fact this does not seem to be the case and anyhow 
there should be no sort of distinction The most perfect 
attainable asepsis should be secured in every case whether 
abdominal or not and whether the injury is severe or 
trifling 
Bullet Wounds of Liver Spleen and Kidney 
But even if a special hospital were provided in the field 
with every sort of provision for the most effective and early 
treatment of patients with abdominal wounds it is more than 
doubtful whether laparotomy would often be necessary or even 
advisable in the case of penetrating wounds due to smallbore 
bullets The extent of injury to the viscera from which a 
patient can recover is still quite uncertain when only pallia 
tive treatment is adopted  and again the extent of injury is 
largely a matter of conjecture 
It is quite certain that a smallbore bullet may penetrate 
the whole thickness of the liver from side to side or from 
before backwards without setting up fatal mischief some 
times even without giving rise to symptoms of any moment 
Even if large blood vessels are partially divided in the liver 
the haemorrhage need not be serious A very small lacera 
tion of this viscus is likely to prove a more serious injury 
than the most extensive perforation and smallbore bullets 
do not lacerate There are cases enough that have come 
under treatment where the wound of the liver has been com 
plicated with that of other viscerathe lung kidney or in 
testines for exampleand where the patient has made a 
good recovery Anatomical considerations make the diagnosis 
of wound of the liver certain in most cases Sometimes there 
are practically no aftereffects at all sometimes hsematemesis 
occurs Unless there were evidence of extensive effusion of 
blood taking place into the peritoneal cavity there is 
no indication for laparotomy and not even the most enthusi 
astic young surgeon joyfully finding himself emancipated 
from control or even the most ardent specialist would 
dream of advocating operation 
Probably the same remarks apply to the spleen though in 
this case the diagnosis must be as a rule conjectural The 
abdomen might be opened in these cases and some blood 
sponged out or something might be sutured and the patient 
might recover but no one would doubt that if such a surgical 
misdemeanour were perpetrated the recovery would be post 
and not propter 
Bullet Wounds of Stomach and Small 
Intestines 
Anatomical considerations do not however guide the sur 
geon clearly to a precise diagnosis when the intestinal area is 
involved It is even uncertain whether the stomach in many 
instances of apparent wound of that viscus is really injured 
In the case of the commencement or termination of the large 
intestine tolerable certainty can be felt as to whether it is 
wounded or not and a fairly accurate idea can be gathered 
judging by the direction of the wound as to whether perfora 
tion is single or multiple 
But when the area of the small intestine is invaded it is 
profoundly uncertain whether there are few or many perfora 
tions and whether blood vessels of any size are damaged in 
the mesentery The small intestine may almost entirely 
escape when it seems incredible judging by the wounds of 
exit and entrance that anything short of the most extensive 
injury should have been inflicted  and on the other hand the 
number of perforations may be so large from a penetrating 
abdominal wound of no great length that the arrangement of 
the intestines as the bullet passed through them is quite in 
explicable however oblique the wound Thus a case is 
reported in which no fewer than thirtysix different perfora 
tions were discovered On the other hand the bullet may 
take so fortunate a direction that only some four or six holes 
may be made and these may lie all close together and involve 
but a small length of the gut It is impossible to predict the 
condition likely to be found on opening the belly The degree 
of shock affords no criterion Abdominal exploration is there 
fore at best a very experimental proceeding and the uncer 
tainty as to the actual extent of the injury must necessarily 
involve much searching among the viscera 
These unfavourable features entail other grave drawbacks 
to operation First that the operation is likelyindeed 
almost certainto be protracted and secondly that much 
exposure and chilling of the viscera is sure to take place 
Now surely the great factors for success in abdominal surgery 
are that the contents of the abdomen are not unduly exposed 
are kept warm and that the operation is conducted with all 
possible rapidity It is hardly possible to approach tco 
closely the limit that divides speed from haste These all 
important conditions cannot from the very nature of the case 
be observed 
The most favourable condition for the stomach or intestines 
to be in when the bullet passes through them would seem to 
be one of emptiness and collapse Under these conditions a 
smallbore bullet may probably pass through often making 
little more than a slit and the perforation is practically val 
vular from the first Presumably if the edge of the collapsed 
intestine is struck a piece is cut out and leakage is likely to 
take place into the peritoneal cavity The same seems to be 
true of stomach wounds though in this instance one would 
imagine that the opening is even more likely to close spon 
taneously without permitting escape of contents than in the 
case of the intestine Lymph is very rapidly effused and it 
is very likely that in the course of an hour or two the fate of 
the patient is decided If even a small amount of the con 
tents of the intestine escapes before the wound is sealed by 
natural means the issue is likely to be fatal and the progress 
of the case is not likely to be diverted into a more favourable 
course by abdominal section And if no extravasation of the 
contents of the hollow viscera of the abdomen has occurred no 
real good will come of exploration while much harm may 
ensue Not only will an operation have been done that was 
really needless but the natural process of cure may be 
gravely interfered with 
Exploratory operation is probably more justifiable when 
there is good reason to suppose that the stomach is wounded 
than when the alimentary tract lower down is the seat of 
injury But here experience of civil surgery shows that the 
element of time though a consideration of the first moment 
is a less cardinal factor than when the intestine is involved 
In cases of perforating gastric ulcer for instance the prognosis 
while grave if more than twentyfour hours have elapsed is 
by no means hopeless with operation if the patient is not 
seen till much later But the mere mention of a disease such 
as gastric ulcer compels me to emphasise the essential the 
vital difference as regards treatment between the perforation 
due to a destructive exsanguine breaking down and that

caused by traumatism such as the perforation of a bullet in a 
healthy vigorous man 
Wounds of Large Intestine 
Many cases have been met with in which the large intestine 
has presumably or almost certainly been wounded and it 
appears to be pretty well agreed that these cases are best left 
alone so long as no untoward symptoms arise The following 
is a fairly typical example as regards its progress of a wound 
that involved the large intestine possibly even perforating it  
A private was shot at a range of 800 or 900 yards The bullet entered 
justbelow the crest of the ilium just on the outer edge of the left erector 
spinse The ilium was pierced this bone usually is drilled by 
smallbore bullets without any great breaking up and the 
bullet which preserved the usual direct course throughout 
passed out beneath the pubic arch and ran down the inner side 
of the right thigh lodging 1 finally at the back of the femur close 
to the adductor tubercle in which situation it was detected by the 
Roentgen rays and subsequently extracted The bladder was injured and 
for five days the man had hsematuria The chief interest of the case how 
ever lay in the intestinal injury For some ten days there was marked 
distension over the course of the descending colon Over the abdomen 
generally there was pain and tenderness and some general distension 
The symptoms were so far marked and the condition 
appeared so grave that many surgeons familiar only with civil 
practice would not have hesitated to explore Had this been 
done and had the patient not succumbed the successful result 
would have been attributed to the operation and it would have 
constituted another probably published triumph for abdominal 
surgery However nothing in the way of operation was per 
petrated The symptoms gradually as in many other cases 
that I have seen before and since subsided and recovery fol 
lowed There was a slight degree of cystitis present when he 
was discharged from hospital 
Wounds op the Bladder 
Wounds of the bladder are not very frequent and are liable 
to be extensivefand lacerated for while the ilium is usually 
drilled the rami of the pubes and ischium tend to break up 
extensively In a few instances recovery has taken place after 
a urinary fistula has formed the water being discharged 
direct from the bladder into the perineum or groin but the 
prognosis is generally unfavourable and theses patients are 
always anxious cases 
Nursing in Abdominal Cases 
It is in injuries of this nature that the weakness 
of the nursing makes itself felt Every patient re 
quires a special nurse The nursing sisters do not attend 
to such casesmores the pity and thus the patients are 
looked after by the orderlies However hard these men work 
and in many instances they work with the utmost industry 
and intelligence they seem incapable of bestowing the same 
patient unremitting watchful care on a distressing and 
ungrateful case that a nurse if worthy of the name always 
has it in her power to give Very slight influences will tip 
the balance one way or the other and really good nursing may 
in cases of the kind absolutely determine the issue There is 
not much of romance about a patient with a urinary i or a 
faecal fistula or a case of fractured spine 
with paralysis of the 
t phincters Most women can effectively sit by the bedside of 
a patient fan away the flies and put eaudecologne on the 
forehead persisting in these simple duties with a quiet 
patience that appeals very directly to the sympathies of those 
who do not understand what nursing really is or can be But 
the hardworking practical conscientious woman who keeps 
one of these distressing cases always dry who can ward off 
bedsores and who in short does a world of invaluable work 
that does not show and does not appeal to anyone save the 
medical officer gets little credit for what is real nursing 
Diagnosis and Prognosis 
It is not of course possible in many cases of probable injury 
or perforation of the large intestine to assert what the lesion 
actually is or indeed sometimes even though the abdominal 
symptoms are strongly marked whether there is any real 
lesion of the gut The best rule of practice however appears 
to be to wait on events It will seldom happen that any more 
formidable operation will be called for than the opening of an 
abscess in the later stages 
Gunshot wounds of the small intestine still remain very 
formidable injuries Some indeed doubt whether recovery 
can take place and are inclined to urge therefore that how 
ever great the mortality after operation however unfavourable 
the condition of the patient and his surroundings abdominal 
exploration gives the only though admittedly a very faint 
chance Opinions appear to differ I may be allowed mean 
while to express the most emphatic opinion against lapar 
otomy in these cases as a routine measure to be adopted when 
ever the circumstances appear to justify its performance at 
all The routine practice should be to avoid operation and 
the instances where it might be proper to operate will I 
believe be found to occur so rarely that they may here be 
neglected 
It will of course have been understood that in all the fore 
going remarks on penetrating abdominal wounds I have been 
referring to what may be called primary laparotomy Various 
operative proceedings including abdominal section may 
obviously be needful during the progress of the case 
Grave doubts have been expressed and by competent 
judges as to the possibility of recovery after penetrating 
wounds of the small intestine even with the normal Mauser 
or LeeMetford bullet No doubt the injury is one of the very 
gravest kind and probably in the vast majority of cases fatal 
There seems however no reasonable ground for doubting that 
recovery does occasionally take place by natural means Thus 
a man received a wound from a Mauser bullet which entered 
close to the umbilicus and passed out through the liver It 
I was almost impossible to conceive how in this case the small 
I intestine could have escaped injury and such injury neces 
sarily implies perforation The immediate aftersymptoms 
were grave Much distension as usually happens occurred 
and for days life hung in the balance Convalescence was in 
terrupted some three weeks after the injury by a severe attack 
of abdominal pain associated with vomiting that persisted for 
some twelve hours But this formidable attack subsided 
without serious consequences and convalescence once re 
established promised to proceed to complete recovery 
In another patient the bullet entered close to the posterior 
superior spine of the ilium on the right side and made its exit 
between 3 and 4 inches to the left side of the umbilicus and 
level with it Here again owing to the oblique direction of 
the wound the small intestine can scarcely have escaped 
injury The man had been long without food and the intestine 
I throughout was presumably collapsed when wounded Dis 
tension soon followed and increased for two days but then 
subsided There was no vomiting in thiscase Recovery was 
rapid and permanent 
In no case where the intestine has been wounded is it safe 
to predict recovery under three or four weeks A painfully 
dramatic case that occurred in the early part of the campaign 
exemplifies the wisdom of withholding any positive prognosis 
for a long time 
A man had been shot through the abdomen The immediately grave 
symptoms had passed away and everything seemed to be progressing 
favourably Indeed the case occupied a sort of post of honour in the 
ward as one of sensational recovery Some two or three weeks after the 
wound was received I speak from memory only as to dates the patient 
raised himself suddenly in bed exclaiming 
4 
Why I am going to die 
I after all The verdict was true Distension of the abdomen began and 
I increased with startling rapidity and the man sank and died in a few 
hours Probably in this case a gangrenous patch of bruised gut gave way 
I suddenly or there was haemorrhage from a large vessel 
Need bor Pathological Investigation 
It must be admitted that up to the present the postmortem 
records of these and other classes of cases of great patho 
I logical and surgical interest and value are rather meagre 
There is no pathologist provided for general hospitals by the 
I regulations and the medical officers have to look after this 
I allimportant department themselves In this connection it 
I may be remarked that the instruments supplied for making 
I postmortem examinations were neither numerous nor ade 
I quate for the work The boxes were hardly fitted up in the 
I most modern or convenient way The difficulties were in 
I consequence much increased In a hot climate it is no very 
I light or pleaaant task to make a systematic necropsy and in 
I times of pressure of hospital work the duty is apt to be 
I neglected when the performance of the examination depends 
I solely on the energy and interest in work of the medical 
I officer Moreover it is far from being desirable or even

the kindness and zeal of some of the civil surgeons who in 
various hospitals have performed necropsies at my instance 
and primarily for my benefit It is devoutly to be hoped 
that the fullest records published in an accessible form and 
not too long delayed will be in due course forthcoming as to 
all abdominal cases There is an opportunity of ascertaining 
from perfectly reliable statistics what is the best treatment 
for these serious cases and of knowing positively what so far 
as figures can prove the point the real value of laparotomy is 
for penetrating wounds of the abdomen In civil work it is 
almost hopeless to expect that we shall hear of all the failures 
while the successes are made to loom large in print For it is 
the successes that we want others to bear in mind though it 
may be that the failures are what we bear most in mind our 
selves 
Factors in Prognosis 
The conditions of surgery in the fieldfare very different at 
all times from those of civil practice and in no class of cases 
perhaps is the distinction more marked than in the category 
under consideration Penetrating wounds of the abdomen 
however are of such rare occurrence in civil practice that the 
information derived from so large a number of cases cannot 
fail to be of the greatest value and may possibly largely 
modify the views at present held 
The fact is that penetrating abdominal wounds caused by 
emailbore bullets are novelties to all surgeons Experience 
has tobe built up by each one The abdominal specialist 
 
has not the slightest advantage over anyone else Indeed he 
is at a distinct disadvantage with the hospital surgeon who is 
probably far more familiar with cases of injury Experience 
of previous campaigns too counts for little If we want to 
seek for parallel cases to the remarkable recoveries which 
have of late excited so much attention to recoveries after 
penetrating wounds of the abdominal or of the thoracic 
cavity we must go back not to the lastor for fear of starting 
again a question that is as tiresome as it is interminable let 
me say the nineteenth centurybut to the days of duelling 
with the small sword or to the times when Ambroise Par 
was the leading authority on military surgery It is whole 
some though it may be a little surprising or even humiliat 
ing to find that these miraculous recoveries were not wholly 
unknown in preantiseptic and preansesthetic times and 
when the more elaborate surgical operations were not even 
contemplated in the field Pending the publication of full 
reports which will include it is to be hoped detailed records 
of all operations performed we can but summarise the expe 
rience gained At the same time I have little fear that with 
more elaborate returns of abdominal wounds the general 
views that have been expressed above with regard to their 
operative treatment will be upset 
A few cases of appendicitis came under treatment and 
some cases of abscess of the liver following old dysentery 
Enteric Fever and Perforation 
I did not hear of any instance in which it was thought 
proper to open the abdomen in order to deal with perforation 
of the intestine from typhoid ulcration The type of enteric 
fever was a bad one and the operationof questionable 
value in most casescould hardly have been seriously enter 
tained

THE PRINCESS CHRISTIAN HOSPITAL TRAIN IN 
NATAL 
By George Ashton MBVict 
Civil Surgeon to the Hospital Ship Nubia 
Durban Natal March 23rd 
The original intention was to appropriate this train for the 
Cape lines and it was landed in Capetown in the belief that 
it would be used between the northern divisional field hos 
pital camps and the large base hospital at Wynberg Lord 
Roberts however apparently considered that the two impro 
vised hospital trains on the Natal Government Railway 
needed supplementing in view of the seriousness of the 
engagements of General Buller in the relief of Ladysmith 
and accordingly ordered the Red Cross train on to Durban 
Unavoidable delay occurred in the reshipment of the numer 
ous heavy packages at Capetown  and owing to the crowded 
harbour here there was some delay in landing the packages 
consisting of sections of the train packed in large crates 
All the available mechanical men on the staff at the loco 
motiveworkshops were put upon the construction of the train 
that is the sections ready to be fitted together as they arrived 
from England  and so great was the expedition and the energy 
shown in the work that the complete train was hauled out on 
March 16th just three days after the receipt of the last cases 
Next evening the train left for the front and has already 
brought down several loads of sick and wounded men This 
was the earliest opportunity that could be taken as the trestle 
bridge over the Tugela was only then completed Amongst 
those who were present at the trial trip were Sir John Furley 
Chief Commissioner of the British Red Cross Society in South 
Africa Colonel Forester Mr Frederick Trves and many 
doctors from the various hospital ships in port The engine 
was most gaily decorated with evergreen the Irish flag flying 
alongside the Union Jack in honour of St Patricks Day and 
the Queens gift of shamrock to her soldiers and also bore on 
the front a large portrait of Her Majesty whose practical 
interest in the train embraced the presentation of its blankets 
It was intended at first to have a train of ten carriages but it 
was found that one of seven would be more suitable consider 
ing the narrow gauge and steep gradients of the South African 
railways 
The carriages are spacious they run on bogies and are 
fitted throughout with the vacuum brake Each carriage is 
36 feet long 8 feet wide and 8 feet high There is excellent 
ventilation provided in the roof The doors are wide and 
broad portable steps are provided thus affording easy access 
from the ground at places where there are no platforms The 
train is made up in the following order  
No 1 contains three compartments The first is fitted all round with 
cupboards for linen etc the whole of the extreme end being occupied by 
a large chest for soiled linen lined with zinc and ventilated from out 
side the zinc lining and the constant passage of air throughout preventing 
any offensive effluvia from entering the carriage The next contains 
beds for two invalid officers These beds are lounges and lockers by day 
and at night are converted into beds The next compartment has a 
similar arrangement for the two lady nurses with the addition of curtain 
which can be drawn in front of each 
No 2 car is also divided into three compartments and may be called 
the doctors quarters The first is for two medical officers and the fittings 
are similar to No 1 Next to this is the officers dining room where half 
a dozen people can enjoy themselves conf ortably The next compartment 
is the surgery Along one side runs a wide bench to be used for dis 
sensing 
fitted underneath with drawers Occupying about onehalf of 
he opposite side are shelves and racks contrived to hold bottles and 
glasses etc without any danger of their being upset by the movement of 
the tram Sufficient space is left for an operating table 
Nos 3 4 5 and 6 are the hospital wards and are all fitted alike Each 
carriage contains 22 beds18 for invalids and 4 for attendantsranged on 
either side in three tiers with a passage 2 feet 6 inches down the middle 
of the carriage The bed consists of a light iron frame with a netting of 
wire across on which is placed a hair mattress tightly sewn down in 
transverse rows of stitches forming a series of rolls 4 inches wide These 
do not interfere with the comfort of the patient and allow of the mattress 
being folded or rolled up into a comparatively small space and to better 
withstand the rough usage it will doubtless have to undergo The 
frames with the beds on them are laid on iron brackets secured to the 
sides of the compartments the upper portion having a slot the entire 
length corresponding with a small projection on the upper part of the 
bed frame which enables the bearers to slide the frame into position and 
keep it secure when there The upper parts of the brackets are uphol 
stered in leather in case the patient below should come into contact with 
them  a small matter but showing the thoughtfulness displayed even in 
small things When wanted for use the bed is taken down and the 
invalid transferred to it from the ambulance It is then lifted into the 
carriage and gently raised by pulley blocks fixed to the roof to the 
required level and adjusted on the brackets The use of the pulleys 
enables one man standing clear of the bearers to raise the bed leaving 
the two bearers free to guide it to the proper position and look after the 
Eatient 
Without an arrangement of this description the bearers would 
e fully occupied lifting the bed and would not have their hands free to 
I assist the patient an assistance which could not be rendered by a third 
person owing to the narrow space between the beds To protect the 
patient from sun and rain whilst being transferred to the bed an awning 
supported on telescopic posts can be hooked up over the door outside the 
carriage 
No 7 carriage consists of a businesslike and comfortable kitchen con 
taining a 4 feet 6 inches cooking range well fitted up with utensils two 
large filters refrigerators cisterns for storage of water a bunker for coal 
and all other necessaries for cooking for nearly 100 people at a time Ad 
joining is the compartment for the guard of the train and beyond that 
again is the larder or pantry and the cook and his assistant are kept there 
when not working it being their sleeping compartment as well as a 
pantry Here there are a number of conveniences provided and the natty 
manner in which these are all stowed away was sufficient to excite the 
envy of the ladies who inspected them on Saturday Every carriage has a 
lavatory and closet and a small stove with a kettle for heating water All 
the available space has been utilised for drawers and lockers racks and 
I shelves and all sorts of conveniences even the roof being pressed into

service  two lockers for storing linen having been constructed in the  
upper storey At both ends of each carriage is a doorway opening on to 
a gangway connecting with the next carriage and as there is a centre 
corridor running through the vehicles free communication is secured from 
one end of the train to the other 
As it stood at the railway station it looked a handsome train 
the pleasant brown of the highlyvarnished teak of which it is 
built throwing up in bright relief the large Red Cross on a 
white square ground pointed on each carriage to indicate its 
purpose in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Con

THE HOSPITAL SHIP  
NUBIA 
Return to England 
The hospital ship Nubia which left Durban on April ist 
arrived at Southampton on May ist with 28 sick and wounded 
officers and 270 noncommissioned officers and men from 
Durban Most of the invalids came from Intombi and Mooi 
River hospitals and had gone through the vicissitudes of the 
siege of Ladysmith 
The Nubia is a P and O steamer that for some years past 
has been chartered by the Admiralty as a transport An 
account of her conversion at Durban into a hospital ship was 
given in the British Medical Journal of February 17th 
p 408 and Sir William Stokes referred to the excellence of 
the arrangements made in his letter published in the Journal 
of March 17th p 663 
Captain Gordon Kelly RAMC Militia is the medical 
officer in charge and under him there is a staff of 5 surgeons 
and 7 nursing sisters 
Analysis of 100 cases of Mauser Bullet Wounds 
Mr George Ash ton MBVict Surgeon to the Nubia sends 
us the following observations on the Mauser bullet wounds 
treated on the Nubia during the three months ending 
March 31st for which the ship was stationed in Durban har 
bour and was used as a base hospital As the result of care 
ful analysis of the first 100 cases admitted to the Nubia all of 
whom were wounded at Colenso or Spion Kop I am able to 
give the folio wine figures  
Return to DutyOf these 100 men 40 returned to the front fit and able 
to resume their duties there  the other 60 were invalided to England as 
unfit for further service in the present campaign These results at first 
sight seem disappointing but it must be remembered that the slightly 
wounded men would not have been sent to the Nubia which was the base 
hospital at the utmost limit of the lines of communication So these 100 
cases may be looked upon as those coming under the head of  
severely 
wounded when a return of 40 per cent to the fighting lines is a matter 
for congratulation 
Duration of IllnessThe average time these 40 cases took to resume 
their duties was 363 days ora little over 5 weeks Two men returned 
in the incredibly short space of 10 days one in n days and another 
in 19 days  the longest in this series of cases was 64 days 
Multiple Bullet WoundsTwo men were hit with 3 bullets  9 men were 
hit with 2 whilst the remaining 80 had one bullet apiece  these 100 cases 
thus represent 113 bullets In three cases 1 bullet caused 4 distinct 
wounds passing in 2 cases through both legs and in the third through the 
hand and leg an excellent testimonial to the enormous penetrative power 
of these modern pr otee tiles 
Site of WoundsThe parts of the body hit were as follows Head 2  
face 5  neck 3  chest 17  back 6  abdomen 2  upper extremities 41  
lower extremities 37 The upper extremities were naturally hit the most as the present style of warfare largely consists in firing in the prone posi 
tion behind a rock or kneeling in a trench and so the shoulders and arms 
are the regions most exposed It was a matter of surprise however 
to find that of these 41 wounds in the upper extremities 21 were in the 
right 1 should have supposed that the left extremity would have more 
frequently been hit as in the position of firing a rifle the left arm and 
shoulder are well to the front Of these 113 bullets no fewer 
that 24 were retained so my experience does not accord with 
that of Mr Makins who in the British Medical Journal of 
February 17th states that retained bullets are uncommon  of these 
24 retained bullets 12 were removed one through the original wound 
whilst the other 11 necessitated a counter opening The 12 remaining 
bullets were either localised in places where it was dangerous to attempt 
their removal or were causing no inconvenience and so were left alone  
their positions were  chest 7  face 1  groin x  knee 1  elbow 2 The x 
rays were applied in iq cases Bone was struck in 26 cases and 18 opera 
tions were performed of which 4 were amputations all fingers 12 for 
removal of bullets and the remaining 2 for removal of necrosed bone in 
both cases following gunshot fracture of the humeras Four finger am 
putations as the result of 1x3 bullet wounds would have seemed incredible 
seven months ago 
ShockAs showing the small amount of shock caused by the Mauser 
bullet in only 15 cases did the man struck become unconscious or faint and the parts struck were chest 6  head 2  face x  neck 2  shoulder 2  
thigh 2 
AgeAs regards the age of the men the average worked out at 259 
years  2 were 18 and 19 respectively 75 were between 20 and 30 22 between 
30 and 40 whilst 1 a colour sergeant was 4r 
The Field DressingThe pocket field dressing was applied in 62 cases 
either by the wounded man himself or by his comrades and as some of 
these wounded men lay on the field of battle at Spion Kop for twentyfour 
hours before they were removed by the stretcher parties this dressing 
may to an extent account for the total absence of septic cases in this 
series of wounds Many surgeons from the front whom I met in Durban 
expressed their surprise and approval of the excellent way in which the 
men had bandaged one another and extemporised splints and tourni 
quets from rifles bayonets and handkerchiefs 
Finally I desire to state in justice to the Boers that there was not a sus 
picion of any of these 113 wounds being due to the socalled explosive or 
expanding bullet  
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
By a South African Campaigner 
XXI 
Rhodesian Field Force 
Inasmuch as the despatch of a force under General Sir 
Frederick Carrington to Rhodesia constitutes a new departure 
in military policy the movement will be followed with con 
siderable interest It has for some time been felt by the 
authorities that the forces there were scarcely adequate to pro 
tect that country from any determined effort on the part of 
the Boers and 5000 picked soldiers will be a very welcome 
addition to the defences of Rhodesia A portion of the force 
has already landed at Beira and others are to follow from 
thence they will proceed through the lowlying and in the 
summer the unhealthy country of the Pungwe Valley to the 
Transvaal frontier Marandellas is a station on the Beira 
railway and the route which the troops should take from 
this point has been the subject of a good deal of discussion 
among men who know the country It is useless to disguise 
the fact that one of the enemies and perhaps the chief enemy 
which this force will have to encounter will be the unhealthy 
conditions of certain lowlying districts within Rhodesia where 
malaria among men and horsesickness among horses are both 
severe and even deadly during the summer months The valley 
of the Pungwe up which the Beira railway proceeds has an evil 
reputation for these diseases and there are other lowlying 
tracts of country which if not quite are very nearly equally 
objectionable It is true that the summer months are past 
and that May may be fairly regarded as one of the winter 
months At the same time it is not unusual to get a certain 
amount of malaria even as late as this The route therefore 
which will be taken by the force from Marandellas is one of 
moment It will be possible for the force to march by way of 
Victoria and across the Lundy river and through a portion of 
the bush veld to Tuli The alternative route would be by way 
of Salisbury Gwelo and Bulawayo to Palachwe The former 
route would be shorter but would be through a much more 
lowlying and less healthy district than the latter which 
would offer not only the advantages of higher and healthier 
 
round but a railway over a considerable portion of the 
istance For these reasons we cannot help hoping that in 
spite of rumours to the contrary the Rhodesian force will be 
taken along what is practically the top of the watershed 
through Gwelo and Bulawayo It must be borne in mind that 
both horses and men are fresh to the country and therefore 
particularly susceptible to those diseases which are local in 
their origin 
Alcohol and the Native Population 
I see from the British Medical Journal of April 28th that 
Dr Kolle who had just returned from South Africa where he 
has been studying bovine plague has been giving the Berlin 
Medical Society the benefit of his views as to diseases in that 
part of the world What the value of Dr Kolles observa 
tions on bovine plague may be I do not attempt to estimate 
but if they are no more accurate than the political and other 
opinions which he appears to have given expression to in the 
course of his paper the Berlin Medical Society will not have 
gained very much With reference to Dr Kolles statement 
that alcohol is 
 
the chief factor in the mortality of the negro 
population I would point out that alcohol is only a deadly 
factor in the mortality of such negro population as can obtain 
alcohol An unrestricted supply of alcohol as a matter of 
fact has been obtainable in the past wherever with the 
honourable exception of the Free State the Dutch have been 
masters of the situation 
Thus in the western provinces of the Colony and on the 
Transvaal gold fields the liquor trafile has been practically 
unrestricted and deadly in its effects Fortunately however

the great bulk of the negroid races have been protected from 
the calamity arising from the wholesale introduction of 
alcohol and protected entirely by the efforts of Her Majestys 
Government and by enlightened legislators in the Cape 
Colony and Natal Thus throughout Rhodesia and in Natal 
the trade is under the severest restrictions and is practically 
prohibited for natives In Bechuanaland the same prohibition 
obtains while in Basutoland a huge native reserve under 
British protection alcohol is absolutely forbidden Fortu 
nately even among the large native territories recently added 
to Cape Colony severe restrictions have in spite of Bond oppo 
sition been placed upon the liquor traffic The great bulk of 
the native races therefore is thanks to the efforts of British 
statesmen untouched by the evils of alcohol Wherever it 
has been freely obtainable throughout the whole of Africa 
alcohol has played havoc among the negroid population So 
far then Dr Kolles observation is correct But inasmuch as 
the great bulk of the negroes throughout South Africa never 
get alcohol at all it cannot be said to be one of the chief 
causes of mortality among them He further speaks of the 
progressive disappearance of the negro races If as this 
observation would appear to imply he is under the impres 
sion that the negro races of South Africa are diminishing in 
number he has entirely failed to acquaint himself with one 
of the cardinal facts of the history of that country As a 
matter of fact one of the great problems for future statesmen 
to deal with is the rapid increase of all the Bantu tribes who 
are by far the majority of the native races Wherever they 
have been placed under some form of settled government 
and where such peace and order have been established as 
obtains in the native reserves under British control the 
Bantu or Kaffir tribes are as hardy and virile a race of men 
as exists on the face of the globe and more prolific even 
than the Boers themselves In Basutoland for instance the 
Bantu tribes have increased with phenomenal rapidity  the 
only natives who have practically disappeared are the Bush 
men The Hottentots who have been the greatest victims of 
alcohol and were practically enslaved by the Dutch have 
certainly not increased in number of recent years but even 
today it is a moot point whether even they have actually 
diminished But with regard to the Bantu there can be ab 
solutely no doubt Their increase can only be compared to 
the increase of the native population in India since the 
establishment of law order and authority in that Govern 
ment 
Base Hospitals 
My correspondent with one of the base hospitals says of the 
Boers recently sent down  
Many were in a sad plight having come from Kimberley and Jacobsdal 
The Boer on his admission to a civilised hospital has to learn several 
thingsto go to bed without his trousers boots and hat  to wash himself 
occasionally as a matter of form  to cease smoking during certain of the 
twentyfour hours of each day  to limit his appetite in accordance with 
the army supplies  to read literature other than the Bible not to sing 
hymns at midnight but allow our poor Tommies to sleep As a patient he 
is not to be compared to Tommy AtHns  he is like a big baby and hates 
bed He clamours for a solid diet when he has an attack of enteric fever 
and persists in rising from his bed when not actually under observation 
it is an interesting fact that many of the cases admitted to the hospital for 
gunshot wounds developed enteric fever after being in for over a fortnight 
or three weeks I am trying to get to the front but as everyone is doing 
likewise there is little chance of my being moved The front is the 
hope and the ideal of the civilian surgeon but few are chosen

GERMAN CONGRESS OF MEDICINE 
From our Special Correspondent 
I Concluded from page 1056  
Wiesbaden April 21st 1900 
Endocarditis  Its Relationship to other Diseases 
This the other and remaining subject set down for discussion 
at this Congress was introduced by 
Litten Berlin who first referred to the ulcerative form 
which he divided into that variety of purely septic origin and 
the other affection which is secondary to acute rheumatic 
diseases peliosis purpura chorea or gonorrhoea though the 
latter variety might very much resemble the true ulcerative 
disease differentiated the two owing to the clinical ana 
tomical and bacteriological modifications Further classifi 
cation he based on clinical and etiological factors because 
every degree of severity could be found between mere valvular 
alterations and actual ulcers An essential feature of the pure 
ulcerative disease was the parasitic nature of the progress 
towards necrosis and ulcration excited by a microbe The 
ulcerative appearance was not always reached by the patient 
who often died while only exudation was apparent Litten 
therefore distinguished the following forms Benign endo 
carditis malignant but nonulcerative endocarditis and 
malignant ulcerative endocarditis taking moreover with 
each the etiological factor into consideration Benign endo 
carditis was not an independent disease but only a complica 
tion of some other disease It did not always show its pre 
sence and was recognised by its consequences The author 
proceeded to describe the wellknown symptoms of ordinary 
endocarditis Its complications were fibrinous pleurisy or even 
pencar dial effusions and should death occur during the acute 
attack it was invariably due to the exciting disease He 
described the pathological changes and laid stress on the 
fact that there was great inclination towards a favourable 
metamorphosis namely sclerosis leading to sclerosisretrac 
tion and shortening of the valve Absolute absorption might 
occur but often a chronic stage supervened with further 
development of valvular defects The susceptibility of the 
left side of the heart he attributed to the greater amount of 
work it had to perform When due to gonorrhoea bacterio 
logical proof was easy As to bacteria of acute rheumatism 
the author mostly found negative results but often discovered 
diplo streptostaphylococci Nevertheless he was convinced 
that endocarditis and rheumatism when existing together 
depended on the same exciting factor As to gonorrhoea it 
might produce both benign and malignant endocarditis and 
might be followed by permanent valvular trouble or resolu 
tion Affection of joints was not a necessary connecting link 
between the onset of gonorrhoea and the cardiac affection In 
gonorrhoea both affections were gonococcic mtastases which 
might appear together or independently Another rheumatic 
affection having a connection with endocarditis was purpura 
hsemorrhagica which the author regarded as a specific infec 
tious disease This cardiac affection was invariably benign 
The affections of the heart accompanying chorea acute exan 
themata or pregnancy were not necessarily of rheumatic origin 
but often part of the individual disease Fatal cases of chorea 
were due to delirium or collapse following a large number of 
attacks and not the result of any endocarditis In the above 
cases bacteriological investigations gave no positive results 
The malignant nonulcerative variety never occurred spontane 
ously but was always accompanied by a severe disease and by 
itself constituted a grave danger to life Thus it was found in 
cases of acute rheumatism chorea and gonorrhoea if with chorea 
as part of a severe rheumatic complication Thus both with 
gonorrhoea and rheumatism the more severe cardiac affection 
presented a higher degree of infection and from the clinical 
point of view this cardiac affection lay between the benign 
and the purely septic varieties Therefore the symptoms 
sometimes inclined towards the one at other times towards 
the other disease The prognosis was not absolutely bad 
Anatomically the changes were either warty or ulcerative 
sometimes both being present at the same time but without 
pysemic deposits The symptoms appeared accompanied by 
pyrexia after subsidence of the rheumatic pains In other 
respects they were much like those of the benign form but 
there was a more serious general condition such as enlarge
