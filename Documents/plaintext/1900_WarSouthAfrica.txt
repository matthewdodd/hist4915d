THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN 
BLOEMFONTEIN 
By an Occasional Correspondent 
Bloemfontein July 7th 1900 
The attack which has recently been made on the medical 
arrangements in Bloemfontein has been as unexpected as it 
has been wholly unmerited From the telegrams which have 
been published here it would appear that Mr BurdettCoutts 
visited the town shortly after its occupation At this time 
railway communication with the Orange River Colony was 
almost cut off by the destruction of several bridges across the 
Orange River Every available train and every possible 
waggon was required to hurry provisions to the front The 
rationing of the troops being of even greater importance than 
the equipment of the hospitals the military authorities 
rightly decreed that it should take precedence of every other 
consideration When Mr BurdettCoutts visited the town 
therefore he found the hospitals insufficiently equipped 
Heedless of the difficulties which beset the medical authori 
ties and unmindful of the excellent work which the RAMC 
had already dono during the campaign he forthwith proceeded 
to frame highlycoloured and sensational charges against the 
Corps He appears to have admitted that in framing these 
charges he was comparing the condition of the hospitals in 
Bloemfontein with that of hospitals in London with which he 
was acquainted Could anything have been more unreason 
able  If we try to picture to ourselves the condition of even 
a fullyequipped London hospital into which 500 bad accidents 
had been admitted in a day we may form some idea of the 
difficulties which the RAMC have had to face in South 
Africa Yet this is what has happened many times during 
the present campaign  whilst on occasions nearly double that 
number of sick and wounded have had to be accommodated 
in a single day and this whilst some at least of the hospitals 
were still in the process of equipment That the RAMC 
have met and successfully dealt with such emergencies as 
these entitles them to the thanks most certainly not to the 
censure of the nation 
I venture to say that no one could have been more keenly 
alive to the temporary shortcomings of the hospitals in 
Bloemfontein than were the officers of the RAMC They 
were however powerlesstied hand and foot by the exigencies 
of the situation 
Were Mr BurdettCoutts to visit the town atthe present 
moment however he would give a very different account of 
the hospital management As soon as the more urgent de 
mands on the railway traffic would admit hospital equipment 
was hurried up from the base In addition to those which are 
housed in permanent buildings there are now seven hospitals 
under canvas in the neighbourhood of the town For many 
weeks past all the hospitals have been fully equipped with 
spring and trestle beds and with all the other requisites 
which are necessary for the comfort of the sick So far there 
fore as Bloemfontein is concerned the sick and wounded are 
as well and comfortably cared for as they would be in any 
station hospital in England and I have reason to believe that 
the same remark applies to hospitals further up the line I 
have frequently visited patients who are being treated under 
canvas and one and all express satisfaction with the arrange 
ments which have been made for their comfort Indeed 
many of them state that they would prefer to be treated in 
tents as these are brighter fresher and better ventilated 
than most of the public buildings in Bloemfontein All the 
cases under canvas which are in any way seriously ill are 
accommodated in large marquees which are provided with 
double roofs and flies The tents are bright and warm and 
the supply of blankets and underclothing is ample so that 
not one of the patients complaiued of cold Indeed there is 
a general consensus of opinion amongst the medical officers 
that enteric fever patients do better in tents than in per 
manent buildings and it is not difficult to understand why 
this should be so When the weather is bright and warm as 
it usually is during the day time at this season of the year 
the flies of the tent can be raised and a current of pure fresh 
air admitted which is both grateful and beneficial to the 
patients 
As for the dieting of the sick the arrangements are all that 
could be desired Each hospital is fitted up with stoves and 
all necessary cooking utensils There is an abundant supply 
of excellent fresh meat fowls turkfys fish eggs butter 
milk delicious bread etc The supply of medical comforts 
is as ample as could be desired and includes champagne 
brandy wines bovril Liebigs extract Brands essence 
tinned and malted milk and many other articles As far as 
I have seenand I have had many opportunities of judging 
the dieting and treatment of the sick in Bloemfontein are 
quite satisfactory 
A further charge has been brought against the RAMC 
by Mrs Richard Chamberlain namely that the officers 
oppose the distribution of comforts to patients This is an 
even more invidious attack than that of Mr BurdettCoutts 
for it is calculated to arouse the resentment of every lady in 
England or at least of all those who have relatives and 
friends serving in South Africa or who have contributed 
towards the funds of the Society An interesting point about 
these attacks is that they were published almost simul 
taneously Is it possible that there can have been concerted 
action  
It has certainly not been my experience that medical 
officers throw any difficulties in the way of the distribution of 
suitable and necessary comforts to the sick Indeed I have 
found them not only willing but anxious to avail themselves 
of these and officers from each of the hospitals pay almost 
daily visits to the Red Cross Society There can be no doubt 
however that articles which are entirely unsuitable are often 
times given to patients in hospital I am aware of instances 
in which bags of biscuits have been handed by visitors to 
men who were in the third week of enteric fever and this 
mistaken kindness has actually led to the death of the 
patients from perforation Can we wonder then if medical 
officers throw difficulties in the way of indiscriminate distri 
bution of articles of diet to men in hospital  Some at least 
of the articles which are sent to hospitals would be injurious 
even to men in perfect health  how much more then to men 
who are convalescing from say a dangerous attack of enteric 
fever  
Again in other cases men in hospital have been found with 
perhaps a dozen cardigan jackets or an even larger number of 
shirts  whilst in one instance that I know of a man was 
found in possession of 29 of these useful articles which had 
been given him at different times by kind but not over 
judicious visitors Patients have even been known to 
exchange articles of clothing surreptitiously for liquor in 
these cases generally of the worst quality Again is it sur 
prising if medical officers occasionally throw difficult s in the 
way of visitors  
Bloemfontein is practically devoid of modern sanitary 
improvements Enteric fever is endemic in the town from 
300 to 400 cases occurring annually amongst the permanent 
civil population Under ordinary circumstances there is a 
good and abundant supply of water derived from the town 
waterworks Shortly after our occupation this was cut off by 
the Boers and a considerable interval elapsed before it could 
be reestablished During this time the large force which was 
encamped round the town had perforce to fall back on shallow 
well and surface vrater As the surrounding district is 
destitute of trees cr of wood of any kind it was difficult to 
obtain sufficient fuel even to cook the mens rations It was 
therefore quite impossible to boil the drinking water It was 
even impossible to filter it for during Lord Robertss historic 
march most of the Berkefeld filters had been accidentally 
broken 
THE HOSPITALS AT CAPETOWN 
From our Special Correspondent at Capetown 
July 11th 1900 
Green Point Camp Hospital 
The Green Point Camp Hospital like its bigger sister at Wood 
stock has grown gradually from very small dimensions to the 
size of a general hospital although it is not as yet graded or 
staffed as such This process of gradual development con 
ducted under the strain of active service conditions is perhaps

the most severe of all tests of the administrative ability of the 
Medical Department and in this case it is the more instruc 
tive from the fact that one officer Major Trevor RAMC 
has been at the head of affairs from the beginning Judging 
by what I have seen on a recent visit neither the Principal 
Medical Officer nor the Department can be accused of failure 
The hospital is in my opinion all that can be reasonably ex 
pected as an agency for securing the wellbeing of the patients 
At the commencement of hostilities when it was decided to 
establish a camp on Green Point Common an ordinary camp 
hospital was of course part of the establishment This was 
4  
nondieted the men simply drawing the ordinary soldiers 
ration supplemented by such extras as the medical officers 
might consider it necessary to order and it was only intended 
for the reception of cases of slight and temporary illness All 
affections of at all a serious nature were transferred to Wood 
stock Later partly because of the large increase in the work 
at the camp partly because of the great pressure on Wood 
stock the Green Point Hospital was largely extended in its 
scope and by arrangement with the Corporation of Capetown 
the Infectious Diseases Hospital then just completed was 
taken into it It became partially dieted and did and is 
still doing the full work of a station hospital treating 
practically all the sick from its own camp a certain pro 
portion of sick landed from the transports and at times 
convalescents from upcountry In addition to this 
owing to the establishment of a camp for the Boer 
prisoners on the common the sick from this place 
have been added to the patients The position of the 
hospital is convenient and except for the drawback of 
a dusty atmosphere not specially evident in winter fairly 
salubrious although not of course to be compared with Wyn 
berg and Rondebosch Green Point and Seapoint the latter 
being a prolongation of the former are the northern suburbs 
of Capetown occupying a gradually narrowing belt of land 
fringing the peninsula between the sea and the foothills of 
the 
 
Lion They are the only marine suburbs those in the 
Wynberg direction skirting the base of Table Mountain at 
some distance from the ocean At Green Point the belt of 
land is still fairly wide and is mainly occupied by a large 
common used as an open recreation ground part of which is 
fenced in as an athletic and cycle track This latter portion 
is now used for the Boer prisoners The whole locality is 
practically a portion of Capetown and is easily reached by an 
excellent tram service The hospital is situated just within 
the city or southern boundary of the common with the New 
Somerset Hospital between it and the sea the Beer pri 
soners enclosure intervening between it and the main road 
whilst the camp proper stretches away to the north Its con 
venience with reference to supplies is obvious whilst its 
proximity to the New Somerset Hospital has frequently proved 
of service enabling the two institutions to render mutual 
assistance in many ways The two staffs have cooperated 
most happily The medical officers of the Green Point Hos 
pital perform the ordinary camp medical duties including at 
tendance on those officers and noncommissioned officers who 
live out of quarters No 5 General Hospital it may be men 
tioned performs the like duties for the garrison at the Castle 
and the main barracks having one medical officer permanently 
detailed for the purpose 
The permanent part of the hospitalthat is the municipal 
infectious hospitalconsists of three blocks one facing the 
street and two at right angles The first of these intended 
for an administrative block is occupied as wards The only 
disadvantage is that the rooms being small a large 
amount of extra trouble in nursing and supervision is neces 
sitated The building is a very fine twostoreyed one excel 
lently built splendidly ventilated and fitted with every 
necessary appliance The kitchen and annexes are connected 
with it and are perfect in their arrangements Indeed so 
far as the permanent buildings are concerned the Green 
Point Hospital is probably the best in South Africa as the 
infectious hospital was designed in accordance with the latest 
ideas of hospital construction Enteric patients who consti 
tute here as elsewhere the majority of the acute cases have 
been placed in the original wards They are lofty airy 
cheerful and newlooking The latrines are fitted with 
Shanks arrangement for the mechanical cleaning of bed 
pans A third small block is used as nurses quarters 
The remainder of the accommodation consists of well 
built iron huts wood lined with a few tents The Principal 
Medical Officers office is a small and inconvenient hut at the 
camp end of the building One of the huts deserves special 
notice as it was presented by British actors and actresses 
and bears a notification to that effect It is used as an enteric 
ward and contains 26 beds 
The Boer prisoners have a block of huts to themselves 
They are extremely comfortable andadmit it One of them 
a field cornet speaking in the mellifluous taal was quite 
profuse in his appreciation of the good treatment he had met 
with and told me that although he was most anxious to get 
out on parole  it was only because he was now convalescent 
and did not need any more attention One at least of the 
nurses a South African lady I noticed to speak Dutch 
The personnel consists of Major Trevor RAMC in charge  
Captain Douglas RAMC and 5 civil surgeons one of them 
a retired Volunteer surgeonmajor There are 12 nurses and 
23 orderlies with a sergeantmajor Only 4 of the orderlies 
are RAMC men When I paid my visit there were 190 
soldier patients and 48 Boers The total accommodation is 
380 for the former and 72 for the latter thus very closely 
approaching the regulation dimensions of a general hospital 
Next to enteric fever dysentery bulks most largely and there 
are a few cases of pneumonia Here as elsewhere treatment 
by magnesium sulphate appears to be the favourite method 
for dysentery On a general survey of the whole place made 
just prior to Mrs Dick Chamberlains letter appeared I can 
only say that any allegations made as to lack of comfort or want 
of cleanliness at Green Point were then certainly unfounded 
My visit was entirely a surprise one and I came away con 
vinced that so far as these essentials were concerned the 
patients in this hospital were as well off as in any civil hospital 
in South Africa better than in most whilst private inquiries 
made from several patients lately discharged have failed to 
elicit any tangible complaints on other points 
The Hospital for Boer Prisoners at Simonstown 
The special point about this hospital for sick Boer prisoners is 
that it is the only one which has been entirely worked under 
civil surgeons Even the outside hospitals such as the 
Portland and the Yeomanry albeit their professional staff was 
civil have been administered by RAMC commandants 
The Palace was organised by a civil surgeon PMO Dr 
Carr who remained in charge ever since and of 
course his junior medical officers have all been civil surgeons 
When the first batches of prisoners were interned on ships in 
the Bay a very lamentable amount of sickness mostly enteric 
appeared amongst them and it became evident that their 
removal to a proper hospital on shore was desirable although 
undoubtedly the original source of the trouble was not in tne 
ships Under these circumstances the Base PMO with 
his usual promptitude in grasping a situation got hold of the 
11 
Palace an old building which was at the time occupied as 
barracks by the Cape Garrison Artillery and had been 
I believe originally built for a hotel Dr Cane at the time 
one o the staff of No 1 General was put in charge and given 
as free a hand in the way of organisation as was compatible 
with a very elementary conformity to military medical regu 
lations He has succeeded remarkably well in spite of many 
obstacles He has had no quartermaster and no steward and 
until lately not even a noncommissioned officer His present 
sergeant is a man promoted from the ranks of the Cape Volun 
teer Medical Staff Corps Consequently he or Dr T G Hall 
his only remaining junior officer do all the work of making up 
diet summaries accounting for stores and the like and they 
may be seen at any time turning from professional work to unlock 
the store and give out so many pounds of butter or so many 
ounces of nort wine The PMO has never had even a clerk 
from the RAMC a Boer prisoner on parole who had been I 
think an attorney in Johannesburg performing the duties 
To carry on things smoothly must have been a difficult task 
but it appears to have been accomplished 
At one time four civil surgeons were on the staff besides Dr 
Cari but now only one remains Dr T G Hall formerly 
District Surgeon of jacobsdal who as I mentioned in one of 
my previous letters bad been working the Jacobsdal Hospital 
for the Boer sick He is a most valuable man understanding 
the Boer character and speaking the taal fluently

There were originally 12 nurses none of the Army Nursing 
Service and two only from the reserve The remainder were 
outsiders and the majority untrained One of these was the 
late Miss Kingsley of whose ability and devotion to the sick 
Dr Carr speaks in the highest terms Several of the 
volunteer nurses were local Dutch ladies There are only 
6 nurses now 
The male staff consists of about 30 none of them RAMC 
some are Cape VMSC some St Johns some line orderlies 
and some civilians Very few speak Dutch but this is not of 
much importance owing to the fact that a large number of the 
prisoners are members of other nationalities and generally 
peak English 
There are now only 40 patients in the hospital  there have 
been as many as 136 The majority of cases are enteric 
fever with a few cases of dysentery and pneumonia and very 
little else On the whole I think that the Boer is a worse 
patient for a disease like enteric than the British soldier 
owing to his peculiar liability to nervous complications He 
is very prone to get a low form of delirium with failing cardiac 
action to which he often succumbs Dr Hall showed me two 
oases in which pure dementia had been left on convalescence 
Many of the cases also showed signs and symptoms apparently 
those of a general neuritis in the third and fourth weeks It 
has been noticed here as elsewhere that many cases of 
enteric keep up a fairly uniform temperature during the third 
and fourth weeks not ranging very high perhaps not above 
1010 or 102o with very slight morning remissions and in these 
cases one learns to form a very bad prognosis  complica 
tions develop or a relapse supervenes and in either case the 
patient dies 
The hospital consists o a main building and four large 
huts but none of the latter are at present in use for patients 
They are constructed after the same pattern as those at 
Woodstock and are roomy well ventilated and comfortable 
The main building consists of a number of small wards 
mostly holding 8 or 10 beds and many open into each 
other They have whitewashed walls and consequently look 
somewhat unfinished but all are scrupulously clean and 
they have never been overcrowded Every comfort is pro 
vided and friends have free access to the patients perhaps 
too much so as they not infrequently abuse the privilege by 
conveying forbidden articles of food 
Besides the official supplies which are liberal to a degree 
plenty of clothing tobacco pipes and other comforts are 
freely supplied by local sympathisers and every deference is 
paid to their idiosyncrasies by relaxing in a large measure 
the discipline of military hospitals properly so called 
This hospital is a standing proof of one thing at least that 
the authorities who can boldly entrust the entire task of 
organisation and administration to a civilian staff are not so 
iiidebound by tradition as some critics assert whilst the fact 
of its being so great a success shows not only the ability of 
Dr Carr but that he must have had the cordial support of 
his chief the Base PMO in his arduous task 
Inspection by General Commanding Lines of 
Communication 
The campaign of criticism against the medical administra 
tion is visibly slackening in view of the failure of the critics to 
bring up tangible facts The General Commanding the Lines of 
Communication has just completed a tour of inspection of all 
the hospitals on the lines and has authorised the publication 
of a general order expressing his entire satisfaction with the 
way in which the sick and wounded are cared for 
DINNER TO WAR SURGEONS AT DURBAN 
On June 30th the medical practitioners of Durban enter 
tained Sir William Stokes Consulting Surgeon to the Field 
Forces and Sir Thomas Fitzgerald of Melbourne at dinner in 
the Durban Club The Rev Dr Booth was also among the 
honoured guests There was a large attendance of members 
and Dr Addison presided In the speeches which followed 
appreciative remarks were made by the Chairman and Dr 
Allen on the services rendered by the guests during the pre 
sent war Special reference was made by Sir William Stokes 
to the unjustifiable and in many instances grotesque charges 
that had recently been made against the Army Medical Ser 
vice He paid a high tribute of praise to the superb way the 
medical and surgical work had been accomplished in the pre 
sent campaign by the army medical officers both in the field 
and base hospitals which undoubtedly had far distanced 
any similar work done in former wars Sir Thomas Fitzgerald 
whose health was proposed by Dr Allen in a felicitous speech 
fully endorsed all that had fallen from Sir William Stokes 
and thanked the proposer not only for his kind references to 
himself but also for what he had said of the splendid achieve 
ments of the Australian forces that had come forward so 
loyally and promptly in defence of their Queen and mother 
country The Rev Dr Booth and Major McCormick 
RAMC also spoke effectively To the toast of The 
Chairman proposed by Sir William Stokes Dr Addision re 
plied in suitable and eloquent terms The entertainment was 
diversified by music and some excellent and humorous anec 
dotes connected with his Colonial experiences were con 
tributed by Dr Damas 
THE PLAGUE 
Prevalence of the Disease 
India 
In Bombay during each of the two consecutive weeks ending July 12th 
and 19th respectively 60 persons died of plague Six to eight deaths daily 
is the record of plague mortality at the present moment The number of 
deaths occurring under the heading 
 diseases of the respiratory system 
 
has increased lately in Bombay and as these have in the past been looked 
on with suspicion as pneumonic plague may be incorporated in the 
return it may be concealment or ignorance is partly accountable for the 
favourable plague returns 
In Calcutta during the week endin July 17th there were 56 cases of 
plague and 53 deaths from the disease a great falling off compared with the 
two previous weeks 
From the report of Captain J K Condon Indian Staff Corps on plague 
the mortality from plague can be fairly well estimated Up to the present 
moment some 300000 persons have died of plague in the Bombay Presidency 
since the disease first appeared in Bombay in September 1896 
Australia 
New South WalesOn July 21st there remained in the plague hospital 
49 cases of plague  during the subsequent week no fresh cases were 
admitted Of the 49 who were in hospital between July 218t and July 28th 
14 were discharged recovered and 1 died leaving 34 in hospital on July 
28th Since the outbreak in Sydney 302 cases in all have ben treated  of 
these 102 died The mortality amongst the Chinese attacked by plague is 
out of all proportion to the deathrate amongst Europeans as of 10 
Chinamen attacked 8 died 
Mauritius 
During the month ending August 2nd 10 cases of plague occurred in 
Mauritius all the cases proving fatal 
Suspected Plague at Hamburg 
The ss Rosario is lying at the quarantine station at Hamburg under 
medical supervision The cause of the detention is that one of the 
crew was found to be suffering from symptoms suspiciously like plague 
The steamer was carrying coal from Cardiff to Hamburg The patient is 
progressing satisfactorily and the rest of the crew continue well 
The Identification of Blood of IndividualsDr W 
Birchmore has satisfied himself that he has discovered a 
method of identifying the blood of individual members of the 
human race In the Neio York Medical Journal of July 7th he 
gives the details of the apparatus and methods which he has 
used for some time in making thousands of bloodcounts and 
he has come to the conclusion that he can without hesitation 
swear to the fact that two specimens are not those of the 
same person and can with considerable certainty say that the 
blood of one stain is the same as that of some other presented 
The sources of error are many for the discrepancies in the 
best of eyepiece micrometers are oftentimes very great The 
personal equation must also be fully considered The author 
believes however that by making a large number of blood 
counts and plotting the results into curves opinions of con 
siderable legal value can be given 
Presentation to Db Alan HerbertAt the Hertford 
British Hospital Paris on August 4th the Honourable Alan 
Herbert physician to the hospital was presented with an 
illuminated address by Dr J F Sutherland of Edinburgh on 
behalf of the former residents numbering twenty Dr Faure 
Millar of Paris presided Sir Dyce Duckworth Dr F H 
Bateman Dr Brandt Dr Edward Neech and Professor 
Berger took part in the proceedings
