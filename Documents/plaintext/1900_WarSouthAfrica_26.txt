FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT 
INJURIES OF THE LONG BONES 
FEw injuries met with in the military hospitals are of greater 
surgical interest than bullet wounds of the long bones These 
injuries may not possess the almost sensational interest that 
attaEches to some of the more remarkable penetrating or per 
forating wounds of the cavities of the body or of the head  
but they exhibit very remarkable features and tat the skill 
and patience of the surgeons to the utmost It is of tourse 
premature in commenting on these as on any other class of 
injuries to deduce at present too definite conclusions The 
opinions that seem to benow generally entertained so far as 
I have been able to gather them from others and supplement 
them by my own observations may be greatly modified by 
further experience It must also be freely acknowledged that 
on several points opinions are by no means unanimous 
as for instance the difference of effect noted in injuries 
received at sh6rt or long ranke At the same time it is 
tolerably safe to assert that the  humane  character of the 
smallbore bullet wound is just as strikingly exemplified 
in lesions of the long bones as in other varieties 
of ipjuries Not only limbs but lives are saved that previous 
military surgical experience would have been led to consider 
hopeless but I believe it to be true however unflattering 
the statement may appear to be that this gratifying result 
is mainly due to the character of the wound and but little to 
any general advance in surgical procedure or even to any 
perfection in carrying out from the first the antiseptic treat 
ment Hitherto pygemia erysipelas and thh like prevent 
able disorders if they have been met with at all have been 
of the very rarest occurrence Nothing can be more grati 
fying or satisfactory but this admirable result must be 
ascribed to its true cause Even suppuration is rare but 
there is no doubt that it is beginning to be seen more fre 
quently than at first The next campaign may take place 
under very different conditions of climate to the present war 
and amidst unfavourable surroundings the enormous value of 
antiseptic treatment of wounds is likely to show out much 
more clearly for truth to tell there is a good deal that 
might sometimes be justly criticised in the military hospitals 
with regard to the carrying out the details of antiseptic treat 
ment The undoubtedly successful results shown by the 
hospitals constitute rather a triumph for the openair method 
than for antiseptic principles as ordinarily practised 
DISTORTION OF THE MAUSER BULLET 
It is desirable at once to modify the opinion expressed in a 
previous letter with regard to wounds from ricochet bullets At 
first it was imagined that most of the bullets that were much 
distorted and showed splitting up of the nickel sheath such as 
Nos 3 and 4 in Fig III see Special Plate were ricochet 
shots Some of them may be but there is no doubt whatever 
that prodigious distortion may be produced in a Mauser bullet 
if it strikes the shaft of a long bone The Mauser bullet has a 
much thinner sheath than the LeeMetford The illustration 
Fig IV shows a Mauser and a Lee Metford bullet side byside 
of the natural size The bullets were on precisely the same 
parIe when the photograph was taken and the comparative 
sizes can thereforebe easilygauged 4 section hasbeen made 
through the upper portion of the bullete so asto show the 
respective thicknesses of the nickel sheathi lt will be in 
teresting heieafter to learn whether the effect on the long 
bones and in the bullet differs at all in the case of the Lee 
Metford Doubtless some opportunities have been a4forded of 
judging of the nature of the wounds made by our rifie though 
tlhe remarkable returns of casualties furnished by the 
Standiard and Diggers News or issued from Pretoria do not 
eeem to hold out any great probabilities in that direction 
CONDITIONS INFLUENCINm ETXENT OF DAMAGE DONE TO 
Boras 
The extent of damage done to the bone depends of course 
materially on the portion that is struck theeffects on the 
elastic shaft with i its large amount of compact tissue being 
different from the effects on the cancellous eds  Againthe 
range must be taken into account There is however great 
difficulty in bbtaining reliable information on this point 
Apart from the notunnatural tendency on the part of the men 
to assume that their wounds were inflicted at very short range 
the conditions under which many of the engagements were 
fought must have rendered it almost impossible to estimate 
the range Too often our men have been exposed to fire from 
many quarterS and with an almost invisible enemy using 
smokeless powder little more than a vague guess can be ex 
oectedl1 In certain actions however it is probable that the 
bulk of the wounlds were inflicted at short range Thus the 
Highland Brigadb at the battle of Magersfontein were beyond 
question very elose to the enemy In others such as the 
action of Willa Grange the wounds were inflicted at long 
range  Judging by skiagraphs and by close examination of 
t0ie very nnumerous cases met with in the hospitals the differ 
ence between the injuries inflicted at short and long range is 
less than would be expected It is imagined by some that a 
small bore projectile travelling at very high velocity and 
rotating rapidly through a bone exerts a kind of expanding 
action in the bone bursting it in fact and producing the 
same sort of effect as at short range it certainly does in the 
skull The evidence of such effects is not very conclusive 
A furtherpoint that must be taken into account is the 
angle at which the bone is struck The bullet may hit the 
sbaft full in the centre strike it more or lesse obliquely in its 
length just touch the edge of the 4ciaphysis or groovethe 
bone transversely The line drawn betweenthe aperturea of 
entrance and exit when both openings are present does not 
afford a very reliable clue Nor it must be admitted in many 
instances does skiagraphy The difficulties for example of 
getting a satisfactory skiagraph of a fractured femur in a 
muscular young man are very considerable Inithe hospitals 
the patients have to be transported a long distance and the 
good that might be gained from a skiagraph showing the 
nature of the fracture would be more than balanced by the 
harm that would result from rousing the patient and disturb 
ing the part Skiagraphy therefore in injuries of the long 
bones of the lower extremity is usually deferred until some 
union has taken place The appearances then are misleading 
for the callusis pervious to the rays 
BULLET WOUNDS OF CANCELLOUs BONE AND JOINTS 
Bullets striking the enlarged and highly cancellous extremi 
ties of long bones appear to drill cleanly through only in 
certain situations Thus many cases Are met with in which 
the condyles of the femur must unquestionably have been 
drilled through withOut fracture taking place The patella is 
usually drilled but may be simply fractured and cases are 
numerous in which the course of the bullet shows that the 
end of the femur must have been perforated as well as the 
kneejoint The recoveries from such injuries are now so 
familiar as almost to have ceased to excite especial interest 
Here the ange as far as can be judged has little effect in 
determining the extent of the injury At veryshort range 
we should expect if any bursting action were exerted on the 
bone that fractures of the lower end of the femur extending 
into the kneejoint would be common I have scarcely been 
able to find any Heemarthrosis is a frequent symptom but 
the swelling usually subsides rapidly A major in the 
RAMC who had seen active service in Chitral re 
marked to me on the  astonishing contrast between 
wounds about the knee in that campaign and the pre 
pent one A bullet striking the patella and injuring 
the femur in that campaign was likelyto convert the cavity 
of the kneejoint into a mere bag of commitiutedfragments of 
bone Amputation was the only resources Ia the present 
campaign it seems scarceVly necessary to put on a splint 
for a few days tStrangelr enough the ipper end of the tibia 
does not seem to behave iu the meway7I ae at rate 
seen several instances ih which this portion of the bone was 
extensively splintered by bullets and the frwture might then 
extend into the lineejoint Much the same effect is seen 
when the lower end of the tibia is struck and indeed some 
of the most troublesome cases to deal with as regards saving 
the limb are those in which the lower end of the tibia is

broken up and where the injury extends into the anklejoint 
The clavicle is often simply fractured and not a few cases 
have been seen in which this bone has been broken by a 
bullet that had previously passed tbrough the neck or through 
the skull I have met with no cases in which the head of 
the humerus was cleanly drilled without fracture though 
some such may have been recorded The lower end of the 
humerus may be drilled but it is more common for a large 
fragment to be broken off Here again when the bullet bas 
traversed the elbowjoint surprisingly little trouble follows 
Complete restoration of mobility is the rule unless and this 
ts common the amount of callus thrown out limits the move 
anent The lower end of the radius might be drilled if the 
bullet entered on the anterior or posterior aspect just as the 
carpal or tarsal bones may be drilled Of such injuries to 
these small bones mention has been made in a previous 
letter 
BULLET WOUNDS Of THE SEHAFT OF LoNG BONES 
It is stated by some and the opinion seems to be borne out 
by experiments in the cadaver that at very close range a 
bullet striking the shaft of a long bone will sometimes break 
clean off and carry out through a large aperture of exic a por 
tion of the entire shaft of the bone some inches in length It 
is difficult to understand how such an injury is mechanically 
brought about by a smallbore bullet but any such observa 
tion resting on a sound experimental basis is conclusive I 
have met with no such cases in the wards though this of 
course does not imply any question of their occurrence The 
only instance resembling the injury I saw in the Fort Hos 
pital at Pietermaitzburg A large portion of thp ulaa had 
been carried clean away But this injury was inflicted by a 
small shell fired from a Nordenfeldt or Hotchkiss gun and 
the aperture of entry is of course proportionately large 
Compound fractures showring a small aperture of en 
trance and a large one of exit are common enough 
but the tendency of the fracture seems almost invari 
ably to be oblique The Mauser bullet at short or 
long range will break up the bone it passes though into 
numerous little fragments which it carries up to or through 
the aperture of exit In Fig V for instance taken from

the arm of a private in the Imperial Light Horse woundea at 
Elandelaagte the range was certainly very short though it 
may have exceeded the estimate given of iSo yards The 
radius is seen to have been transversely grooved The 
bullet entering on the radial and passing out on the ulnar 
4side has carried away a number of small fragments of bone 
and spread them along its track The aperture of exit was 
imall  The radus in this case was completely fractured 
the break having but a slight obliquity The fragments 
as seen are scarcely at all displaced The large aperture 
of exit when it is found iR usually the result of a 
number of broken pieces of bone many of them of con 
siderable size being carried through the wound In 
its action on the shaft of a long bone therefore the 
Maiiser bullet may behave like the old round bullet And 
these effects may be produced when the bullet undergoes no 
alteration whatever in shape but passes clean through the 
limb making an aperture of exit the same in size and 
character as that of entrance In such cases of course the 
comminuted fragments of bone are not driven out of the limb 
but merely displaced move or lees It does not at all follow 
therefore that because a bone is extensively comminuted or 
even that there is great laceration of the soft parts that the 
provisions of the Geneva Convention have been necessarily 
infringed That bullets are in some instances sdoctored 
and that forbidden kinds of bullets are occasionally used is 
beyond all question true for such bullets have been removed 
but it is but just to state that instances of the kind are of 
extreme rarity In any kind of contest the mere suggestion of 
unfair play is apt to make people lose their heads quickly and 
when in warfare the question of infringement of metbods 
sanctioned by civilised communities is raised exaggera 
tion is prone to run riot on very slight evidence and 
on very insufficient data That Mauser bullets whea 
they impinge on the elastic shaft of a wellgrown 
bone in a young man may undergo much distortion tthough 
they have not been submitted to any previous tampering 
seems perfectly clear The bullets shown in Fig III all of 
which were extracted furnish proof enough No I was re 
moved from beneath the infraspinatus muscle The bullet 
had struck the humerus obliquely and caused an oblique 
fracture of the bone It had then probably altered its course 
and glanced upwards lodging beneath the muscle The bullet 
is seen to be slightly bent over at the point and flattened at 
the base but the distortion is really greater than it appears in 
the photograph The bullet was almost certainly fired at long 
range The aperture of entry was that of a normal Mauser 
bullet so that as also in the case of the other bullets shown 
in the illustration the distortion must have been produced 
by striking on the bone It may be noted with regard to this 
case that though the Mauser bullet appears invariably to make 
a perfectly straight track from entrance to exit when it remains 
of normal shape it may when bent up deviate more or less 
possibly in some cases behave like the round bullet in former 
days which if it struck an elastic bone like a rib might 
glance half way or 
more round the body

distorted A plate of bone was broken away from the posterior 
surface and carried backwards but not wholly detached In 
addition a fissure extended from the site of the main fracture 
downwards into the elbowjoint The bullet is seen to be 
oonsiderably bent over at the point and flattened The nickel 
sheath is not split Here again the distortion of the bullet 
is actually greater than appears in the photograph The 
bullet was extracted and the case did well As invariably 
happens when a plate of bone is partly detached and does 
not separate the amount of callus thrown out was very great 
The nature of the fracture is shown by Fig VI drawn from a 
skiagraph 
No 3 Fig III shows the effect produced on a bullet that 
struck the middle of the femur at a range of 6oo or 700 yards 
The bone was extensively splintered and the amount of callus 
thrown out was very great The bullet is greatly distorted 
and  mushroomed The nickel sheath has been burst but as 
can be seen the covering on the point of the bullet is intact 
If such a bullet had been picked up in the ground it might 
have been thought that it had been tampered with before 
firing But the whole of the distortion was evidently the 
result of the impact on the bone for the entrance wound 
showed the exceedingly small sear of a normal Mauser bullet 
and it was extracted from under the skin in the postero 
internal aspect of the limb at the junction of the upper and 
middle thirds The bullet had therefore probably glanced 
upwards after striking the bone 
No 4 was fired at a longer range than any of the others 
shown probably about 1300 yards The wound of entrance 
again was that of a normal Mauser bullet and was situated 
in the midline of the thigh in its anterior aspect The course 
of the bullet was in an upward direction and the bone was 
struck obliquely The bullet was removed from beneath the 
skin some 3 inches below the great trochanter in the postero 
external aspect of the limb The splintering of the bone 
was extensive and a large plate of bone partly detached from 
the posterior aspect of the femur had been shifted backwards 
towards the wound of exit The bullet shows remarkable dis 
tortion The sheath over the point is not split but the an 
terior quarter is twisted round and bent back so that the top 
of the bullet lips half way down and is attached by the nickel 
sheath only The split portions of the sheath project like 
wings The distortion of the bullet was certainly not in this 
instance due to a ricochet for the aperture of entrance was 
that of a normal Mauser The track of the bullet from the en 
trance down to the bone was such as might be seen in a 
flesh wound and there was no undue laceration of the soft 
parts The chief mischief was in the direction of exit

For the specimens and photographs as well as for many 
notes on cases of bullet injuries of the long bones and for 
much valuable information I am greatly indebted to Dr 
L G Irvine one of the civil surgeons in charge of patients 
at the Fort Hospital Maritzburg Frctures of the long 
bones caused by the smallbore bullet at almost any range 
are as will be seen commonly if not almost invariably 
oblique and sometimes very oblique The lines of fissu 
starting from the point of impact radiate out in different 
directions and often to a great length even when the bullet 
meets the shaft almost at a right angle Fig VII may be 
cited as a good case in evidence The probable range was 
about 700 yards The wound of entrance was over the pos 
terior aspect of the arm The bone is obliquely fractured 
and one or two loose fragments are seen lying in the soft 
tissues The bullet which was embedded in the bone was 
bent over at the extremity and flattened but the sheath was 
not split 
Fig I Special Plate is a reproduction of a slkiagraph 
showing a rather more extensive injury to the humerus 
though the range was probably longer as far as could 
be judged about half a mile The bullet in this case 
passed through the left mamnma and great pectoral muscle 
and struck the bone full on the inner side some 5 inches 
above the elbowjoint Numerous fragments of bone are 
seen to have been caried outwards and backwards by the 
bullet The aperture of exit was large The bone again is 
fractured obliquely This patient is making a good recovery 
and union promises to be good 
The treatment generally of cases of fractured humerus 
leaves little to be desired and it is abundantly evident that 
the fractures are most efficiently put up in the field hos 
pitals 
Fig II Special Plate also a reproduction of a skiagraph 
shows an injury of which several examples have been 
shown by skiagraphy and illustrates the point that whether 
a long bone is struck obliquely or directly the fracture is 
likely to be very oblique The man was carrying his rifle at 
the slope over his shoulder when he was hit and his arm was 
therefore flexed at about a right angle The bullet has frac 
tured and split the radius one or two small fragments of 
bone are seen lying near the elbow in the soft parts The 
lower end of the humerus is also fractured and a large plate of 
bone is slightly displaced backwards The fissure probably 
extended into the elbowjoint The bullet may have tra 
versed or may have just missed the elbow joint The wound 
of exit in this case was large The range was estimated at 
five hundred yards This wound was received in the fighting 
by the Tugela river on January 24th Union was progressing

was the same The bullet in this latterinstancehadcertainly 
traversed the elbowjoint and the wound of exit was pre

wounded at Colenso on December 1ith Good union had 
taken place The movements of pronation and supination 
were free but owing to the amount of callus thrown out round 
the fractured humerus flexion of the elbow was limited No

eurgical measure short of a complete excision of the joint could 
have restored full mobility and any such operation appeared 
quite unjustifiable 
FRACTURES OF THEm FEMUR 
In previous wars compound fracture of the femur high up 
was reckoned as almost inevitably a fatal injury The septic 
complications that so continually ensued carried off the 
patient and amputation very high up or at the hipjoint was 
almost uniformly fatal With improved methods of operating 
and with the enormous additional security of antiseptic treat 
ment it was thought probable by many at the outset of this 
campaign that a fair percentage of recoveries might be looked 
for in this class of injuries Such is certainly the case but 
the gratifying if rather unexpected feature has been that 
these patients recover at times without amputation Here 
again the nature of the wound which admits little or no air 
into the depths of the limb the fact that portions of clothing 
or other foreign bodies are rarely carried into the wound and 
the absence of septic influences all influence this desirable 
consummation The excellence of the result to be candid is 
not due so much to the perfection of the antiseptic surgical 
practice as to the fact that the surroundings of the patients 
are highly favourable I am far from suggesting that the 
most elaborate and thorough precautions should not invari 
ably be taken in every surgical detail small or large It 
is impossible to have too many lines of defence to 
borrow a military phrase I simply want the true explanation 
of the satisfactory results to be given so far as I am competent 
to judge 
Another pointand a very important onetells greatly in 
favour of the remarkable recoveries so often witnessed The 
men are not only healthy strong fellows but they are also in 
exceedingly good condition The hardships and privations of 
a campaign must always be considerable With a lack of 
good organisation they may become intolerably severe and 
the effect is quickly seen in the surgical practice of a hospital 
The good organisation of the Transport and Commissariat 
Departments is a matter of indnite moment to the surgeon 
anxious that all his cases should progress well The medical 
officers would I believe be perfectly unanimous in acknow 
ledging that tne Commissariat Department is doing its work 
most admirably and few really are better able to form a 
judgment on the point No department it appears to the 
civilian is more singled out for blame when anything goes 
wrong and no department is less likely to receive its due 
meed of praise when matters go right 
An instance of fracture of the femur high up may be 
quoted as an example The bullet struck the femur juast 
below the lower trochanter and fractured the bone 
as far as can be judged by the skiagraph almost transversely 
Indeed this case sho vs the nearest approach to a purely trans 
verse fracture that I have been able to find The range was 
certainly a long one in all probability not less than Iooo 
yards There was but little splintering of the bone It is to 
be noted that the bone was not strack at an elastic part Some 
would ascribe the good result for the case did well to bhe 
length of the range and the fact therefore that no expanding 
action was exerted in the bone as the bullet passed through 
But in the face of the other cases mentioned above where the 
injury was inflicted at quite as long a range and whpre exten 
sive splintering resulted the line of argument is hardly con 
vincing 
COMPLIcATIONS OF FRACTUIRES OF LONG BONES 
Of the complications attending fractures of the long bones 
there is happily not very much that need be said The chief 
trouble is often impairment of mobility in the neighbouring 
joint owing to the large amount of callus thrown out The 
great amount of thickening so often observed is of course due 
to the frequency with which the bones are split up and ex 
panded and also to the frequency with which large plates of 
bone are partlydetached from the main shaft maintaining their 
hold by the periosteum which preserves itsvitality A frequent 
complication of fracture of the upper part of the shaft of the 
hemerus as might be expected is impairment or complete 
destruction of function of the musculospiral nerve Many 
instances of this are met with Such cases seem for the most 
part beyond the reach of surgery and the paralysis when 
present is likely to be in most instances permanent Of less 
trequency but still occasionally met with are cases in which 
the median or ulnar nerves in the arm or the peroneal nerve 
in the leg have their functional activity destroyed 
While nearly all the fractures unite soundJy with a tend 
ency as pointed out rather to excessive formation of callus 
no union or soft union is met with now and again There are 
two patients now in the Fort Hospital with delayed union 
one an officer with an exceedingly oblique fracture of the 
middle of the femur has very imperfect union if any at the 
end of two months another a private has soft union after 
a splintered fracture of the lower part of the shaft of the tibia 
In the latter case consolidation seems likely to take place 
The wound had been sustained about eight weeks previously 
Occasionally blood vessels have been injured by splinters of 
bone In one rather remarkable case in which the bullet had 
apparently perforated the shaft of the tibia about the centre 
hiemorrhage took place on several occasions from the 
anterior wound Finally a considerable swelling formed 
in the calf of the leg This on being cut down upon 
proved to be blood the result of a perforation 
of the posterior tibial artery There was however no pulsa 
tion or bruit in the swelling The clots were turned out and 
it was found necessary to ligature both the anterior and 
posterior tibial arteries Free collateral circulation had how 
ever been established and the case did well though the 
wound is not yet entirely healed and it seems probable that a 
small sequestrum may separate 
Amputation has been resorted to in but few instances and 
it is likely that the statistics of operations which will be forth 
coming at the end of the war will sbow that conservative 
surgery has been the rule 
Osteomyelitis seems to be unknown so far as I have been 
been able to ascertain 
The treatment of fractures of the femur has not in all cases 
been as satisfactory as could be wished for at first at any rate 
the supply of extension apparatus was inadequate and more 
over the bedsteads are too often unsuitable for the proper 
management of fractures of this description

No 6 GENERAL HOSPITAL 
No 6 General Hospital has been here for four weeks and up 
to March 23rd about I400 sick and wounded had been ad 
mitted for treatment Five days after Colonel Somerville 
Large and his staff arrived from England they were able to 
receive about 5oo men and since then the accommodation has 
gone on increasing until now about 65o beds are available 
200 more have arrived and will be prepared as soon as 
possible 
SICK AND WOUNDED 
Of the cases 400 were gunshot injuries the rest comprised 
all sorts of affectionsenteric fever dysentery diarrhoea 
pneumonia etc These have nearly all come from other 
camps at the front The enteric casesof which there have 
been 105 are from the Modder Rensberg Norvals Pont and 
Kimberley Most of them have been in the record week of the 
diseate have been exposed to all the hardships of the cam 
paign and have been walking about since the disease 
was running its course The deaths have been i6 or 
1523 per cent of those treated From time to time 
the hospital train arrives and removes ioo patients who 
are convalescing and these are carried to the Cape 
or a few hundred miles nearer the hospitals there Thus 
the strain upon the advanced hospitals is relieved although 
at times it is considerable In the period of quiet which has 
elapsed since Paardeberg no wounded men have arived 
here

The marquees in which the patients are accommodated are

But it must also be remembered that all this efficiency has 
only been secured by a departure from previous methods 
Never before was so large a civilian element imported into 
our army medical arrangements in a campaign The present 
Royal Army Medical Corps could never have dealt with the 
demands upon it had it Inot received help At certain places 
the work would have been excellent but it must have failed 
in keeping up that standard in the many scattered places and 
on the field itself But the corps as a framework has been 
judiciously expanded and civil surgeons bave been fitted 
into it and in this way the necessary machinery has been 
effectively worked What is obvious is first that the 
RAMC is entirely undermanned for any unusual demand 
upon it that it is deficient in the number of surgeons order 
lies and nurses and that some time in the future when the 
extperiences of this war come to be weighed a new and better 
scheme must be adopted More nurses are wanted at the base 
hospitals their number at present is inadequate And when 
this part of some future scheme comes to be considered it will 
be necessary to see that no amateur nurses are permitted to 
joineven in an emergency 
THE GERMAN HOSPITAL AT JACOBSDAL 
I met a few evenings ago the Colonel of Highland Light In 
fantry who was commandant of Jacobsdal after its capture 
There he found i German hospital equipped for service with the 
Boers He told me that the arrangements were excellent and 
that nothing could exceed the kindness of the medical officers 
and the whole staff to Boers and British alike I am glad to 
record this testimony which may in this way reach the 
generous people who provided funds for the hospital 
THE CAMP 
At this camp we have had between 7ooo and 8ooo men 
they are coming and going daily some are from England 
some from the Modder all are on the journey northward 
Then there are thousands of horses and mules and a crowd 
of Dengalis and local natives in charge of remounts As is 
usual in such circumstances there is a good deal of mild 
dysentery When such a crowd of living beings is gatlhered 
about a small town where sanitary arrangements are in a 
rather elementary state this is to be expected The danger 
is that in course of time what at present is only a threat of 
trouble may become a reality So far only one or two cases of 
enteric have been admitted from the camp and they were 
probably infected before arrival but with regiments arriving 
from a district where enteric fever is rife these isolated cases 
may be onlythe forerunners of a greater number therefore 
the most rigid precautions as to sanitation around the camp 
must be enforced everywhere Colonel Large is fully alive to 
this and has taken steps to meet posaibilities 
WINTER STORMS 
The winter appears to have come The temperature has 
fallen and we have bad some winds as penetrating as those 
of March at home But our worst experience has been a com 
bination of rain and storm The night befrt last this com 
bination operated with great suddenAes nd very ope had 
to turn out at midnight to loosen tent opes anid keep the pegs 
in the ground But last night the rain fell for hours in tor 
rents making sleep almost impossible by the crash upon the 
canvas It flled the deep trenches to overflowing and 
swept across the camping ground in sheets Fortunately 
there was no such catastrophe as happened to the hospital a 
couple of weeks ago when nine marqaees came down in a 
storm of rain and the patients had to be rescued in the 
midst of a hurricane This morning everything looks at its 
worst The crowd of glistening white tents looking so bright 
and clean in the sunshine is now only a series of bulks of 
muddy grey moist unpleasant bodies The spaces be 
tween them usually crowded by soldiers drilling or preparing 
food are now quite deserted No one is to be seen abroad 
save the sentries or the cooks working here and there at 
the camp kitchens in a rain that searches everything 
it reaches The white scorched surface sand has been washed 
away and the dull brown of the deeper layer adds to the 
desolation The water sweeps everywhere down the slopes ia 
rivulets that quickly deepen in the sand or in broad shallows 
Across the breastwork the veld is covered with sludgy greasy 
mud The Bengalis cower in their tents or if they must 
attend to their horses look wizened and shrunken in the cold 
rain The sky is without a break The clouds cover the 
lowest kopjes round about and everywhere instead of mens 
voices there is only the slushy sound of a deluge But we 
are after all fortunate It is not precisely home life nor are 
our comforts of the drawingroom but our fghting line has 
gone through this and worse without cover and has won vic 
tories and we have at least a protecting canvas 
THE IRISH HOSPITAL SECTION AT PRIESKA 
I have heard from Dr George Stoker and his section who 
have been working at Prieeka They have been with the 
column under Lord Kitchener operating against the rebels 
there They have had plenty to do Now they are marching 
to rejoin us which I expect will be this week 
PROPOSED MOVE To BLOEMFONTEIN 
We are promised a new bridge at Norvals Pont on Wednes 
day then the congestion here will be relieved and we shall 
go to Bloemfontein 
From a telegram received on April 17th it apppars that this 
intention was carried out and that the Irish Hospital had 
been moved to Bloemfontein 
THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
xx 
BOER ANIBULANCES 
DR KORTEWEG Professor of Surgery at Amsterdam has 
written to the Times of April 3rd calling attention to my 
letter in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of March Ioth on Boer 
ambulances In this I quoted from a telegram published by 
the Times from its St Petersburg correspondent stating that 
the Dutch Committee there had received news from Professor 
Korteweg in Amsterdam Dr Korteweg has already pointed 
out in the JOURNAL of March 17th that the statements con 
cerning the Boers were erroneously attributed to him and in 
contradiction with letters published in the Dutch medical 
journals It is unnecessary to point out that whatever errors 
may have arisen in this matter are due to the St Petersburg 
telegram On again referring to it however I confess I do 
not see any statement contained in it which from my know 
ledge of the Boers I should regard as improbable It may be 
admitted that although a Boer is distruatful of a stranger if 
he once gets to know a medical man his confidence is soon 
established Dr lKorteweg however denies the whole of the 
statements attributed to him and it is only just that I should 
frankly accept his repudiation of these statements and ex 
press my regret that I have quoted a telegram in reference to 
him the accaracy of which he denies 
CASES IN THE BASEI HOSPITALS 
A surgeon in one of the base hospitals near Capetown sends 
we some interesting potes with regard to the cases under his 
care He says that during the week previous to writing they 
bad been receiving cases from Paardeberg 
Among them was one of the CIVs who was struck with Mauser 
bullet on the outside of the left upper arm just abovethe insertion of the 


APRIL i21 I900 THE RAML IN SOUTHJFRI A 
CAAI mxTLw JOUmL

deltoid the humerus immediately below its surgical neck was splintered 
the bullet finally lodging in the axilla near the costal arches The 
patlentit is satisfacto to hear is doing well The case is of interest 
as showing that even the Mauser bullet with its enormous velocity 
does not invariably penetrate and in this instance was apparently 
lodged against the ribs 
He relates another case of a man shot in the prone position in the outer 
third of the left clavicle The bullet made an exit posteriorly 21 inches 
from the spine between the twelfth rib and the crest of the ilium on the 
rightside From this it will be seen that the whole of the thorax and a 
portion of the abdomen were traversed by the bullet He says that 
several cases shot clean through the chest showed no symptoms beyond 
pleuritic pain and slight hmmoptysis 
As illustrating the small holes made by the Manser bullet 
with scarcely any bruising of surroanding tissue my corre 
spondent mentions two cases in his wards  
In one of these the first phalanx of the left thumb was pierced by a 
aMsuser bullet the iinjury healed and the thumb remained a perfectly 
usetul one 
Another soldier had the second phalanx of his second right tee pierced 
the wound healing without amputation being necessary 
The general administration of the hospital my corre 
spondent concludes reflects great credit on the Principal 
Medical Officer and the RAMC 
IMPURE WATER SUPPLY 
Dr T Wilson who returned recently from South Africa 
offers some interesting notes with reference to the water 
SuPply 
We impure qualityof the water used by our troops in South Africa 
being mainly responsible for the prevalence of typhoid amongst them it 
maybe of interest to point out briefly the causes ot pollution 
In the first place the supply not being pientiful on the veld the camp 
is pitched on a healthy spot close by a river This no doubt ensures 
quantity but not unfortunately quality Wounded animals make tneir 
way to the rivers to drink with the result that it has not been unusual to 
find as many as fiftv horses during the present campaign in a state of 
advanced decomposition Another agent in pollution is the practice 
 Df the Boers in burying their men who have fallen in battle 
They throw the bodies into the rivers to be carried away by the 
current This has the double advantage from their point of 
view of quickly disposing of their r dead and of hiding their 
103ses from the enemy A permanent source however of mischief 
in this direction and one which unlike the two factors before mentioned 
has no reference to the war is the habit of the natives of bathing in the 
rivers and of polluting the water in other ways When it is borne in 
rhind that soldiers after a long march slake their thirst on the first oppor 
tunity without regard to hygienic considerations the part played by 
impure water in increasing the mortality of our soldiers can be readily 
ap prehended Filters of course are supplied to the troops but most of 
tlhem easily get out nf order often becoming unworkable after a week or 
o The Berkfeld filter I have heard much recommended as it has the 
advantage of being easily cleaned and exceedingly portable 
THE SPECIAL HOSPITALS

battalion and I am afraid bis death is due in a great measure to his sense 
of duty He had been unwell for some time but would continue his work 
to the last although now we know he must have been suffering all the 
time In action he was the bravest of the brave Always in front with 
the firing line and attending to the wounded under the heaviest fire and 
after a light though tired and done up he never rested till all his 
wounded had been carefullyattendedto His memorywill always bewith

high appreciation of the valuable work done by the RAMC in the 
recent campaign You bave been with me during the past four trying 
months This is not the first campaign I have served in by a good deal 
and I desire to say that though I have always seen the members of the 
Medical Department perform their duties meritoriously in no previous 
campaign have I seen the work of the RAMC rise to such a high 
standard Not onlyhave you done valuable work in connection with your 
own Brigade but from the reports I have received from senior officers I 
understand you have been  maids of aU work  wherever medical assi4t

in the ss Servia at Queenstown for South Africa on 
November 3rd On November 29th at Mooi River Natal 
they joined their 4th Brigade which they accompanied 
in all the subsequent operations of the campaign including 
the battles of Colenso Spion Kop Vaal Krantz and the

brilliant victory at Pieters Hill and the relief of Ladysmith 
They were the first medical units to reach the beleagured city 
and took part in the triumphal entry of the relieving army on 
March 3rd 
NOVA ET VETERA 
MANS PLCE IN THE LONDON DISPENSATORY 
In I678 William Salmon Professor of Physic presented the 
world with a translation of the London DispenJatory lately 
reJormed by the Fellows now living of the Colledge of Physicians 
being a Compendious Collection ot the choisest Medicaments 
whether Gallenical or Chymical yet known or in Request The 
work is divided into six books treating of simple vegetable 
medicaments of animals of minerals of compounds internal 
and external and of the practice of chymistry All the sec 
tions well repay perusal but the most remarkable is the first 
chapter of the book  of Animals their preparations Virtues 
and Uses This chapter treats of man and the parts are con 
sidered as they are taken i from a living body and 2 from 
a dead body 
The first item taken from the living body is hair used as a 
powder as ashes as an oil as a distillation and as an elec 
tuary Hair cures the jaundice the simple ashes stop bleed 
ing and an oil distilled from it with bone anointed on bald 
places causes hair to grow 
The nails in powder or infusion are said to cause vomiting 
but they cure dropsies if laid on the navel Fasting spittle 
rubbed on oftentimes cures pimples the stinging of serpents 
and the biting of mad dogs Womans milk is an emollient 
made more powerful if a grain or two of white vitriol be dis 
solved in it 
Menstrua sanguis menstrualis taken from virgins dried 
and given inwardly is prevalent against the falling sickness 
and stone outwardly applied it cures gout and worn as an 
amulet is good against the plague 
A drop or two of the blood of the navelstring being first 
given to a newborn child in a little breast milk prevents con 
vulsions and all other fits and very wonderfully revives it 
almost dead The secundine calcined and given in southern 
wood water every day half an ounce while the moon decreases 
in light wonderfully cures the Kings evil 
Sperma experience has found good against witchcraft and 
some use it to make a magnetic mummy to serve as a phil 
tron to cause love Stone taken from the kidneys or bladder 
dissolves and expels the stone and gravel from all parts and 
opens obstructions being given a drachm at a time in powder 
Stercus the dung is emollient anodyne and maturative It 
ripens plague sores being applied and dried powdered and 
mixed with honey it cures infamed wounds and the quinsy 
The ashes given two drachms at a time in agues cures them 
Occidental civet is made hereof so like the true civet that it 
shall be difficult to discern the difference 
The urine opens obstructions of the liver spleen and gall 
is good against the dropsy and jaundice and causeth easy de 
livery to women in travel Boys urine dropt into the ears 
cures their soreness and opens obstructions there It is used 
aS spiritus as a volatile salt as an essence as a magisterium 
or salt and as an oil Some say that blood drunk hot cures 
epilepsies The owder or ashes of it applied to any flux ol 
blood stops it The preparations of it are a mummy of blood 
a water and oil a balsamum arthriticum which is of strange 
force in the gout and an antepileptic spirit of mans blood 
Among the substances derived from the dead body the most 
important was mummy 
 Mummy is fivefnld I Factitious Pissasphaltum made of bitumen 
and pitch 2 Flesh of a carcass dried by the sun in the country of the 
Hammonians between Cyrene and Alexandria being passengers buried in 
the quicksands 3 iEgyptian a liquor sweating from carcasses embalmed 
with pissasphaltum 4 Arabian a liquor which sweats from carcasses 
embalmed with myrrh aloes and balsam 5 Artificial which is modern 
Of all which the two last are the best but the Arabian is scarcely to be got  
the second and third sorts are sold for it The artiflcial is thus made 
Take the carcase of a young man some say redhaired not dying of a 
disease but killed  let it lie 24 hours in clear water in the air cut the flesh 
in pieces to which add powder of myrrh and a little aloes imbibe it 24 
hours in the spirit of wine and turpentine take it out hang it up a 
hours imbibe it again for 24 hours In fresh spirit then hang up the pieces 
in a dry air and a shadowy place so will they dry and not stink 
Various preparations were made from this precious sub 
stance There was first the tincture or extract of mummy 
used as a counterpoison It prevents the plague and resists 
all manner of infection being taken only to a scruple and 
cures being taken to a drachn or two drachms A treacle 
was prepared from it The elixir mumice has all the virtues 
of the tincture besides which it is more speedy in the cure of 
the plague 
Balsamum Mumie a sweetscented red oil which has such piercing quali 
ties thatitpierceth all parts restores wastcd limbs consumptions hectics 
and cures all ulcers and corruptions if gr iij v or vi be given twice 
every day in a proper vehicle 
A few other curious formulm for preparations made from the 
dead body may be reproduced 
Aqua DivinaTake the whole carcase of a man violently killed with 
the intrails cut it in pieces and mix them distil it from a retort twice or 
thrice It is reputed to have a magnetic power lf to z drachm of this 
water you put a few drops of the blood of a sick per3on and bet them on 
the fire and then mix the sick recovers if not the sick dies For want 
of blood take the urine in a larger quantity 
Adeps Grease or FatIt is emollient discutient anodyne and cos 
metic It is said to flll up the pits after the smallpox 
Mans BonesThey stop fluxes astringe and take away the pains of 
the gout They are taken either levigated into a fine powder with water 
or calcined in a potters furnace to ashes By a retort you may distil an 
oyl from them which is very anodyne their marrow is of excellent use 
to cure contracted sinews and members 
The Skull is a specific in the cure of most diseases of the head the tri 
angular bone in the temples is the most specificial against the epilepsie 
The preparations are the magisterium made by dissolving the skull in 
spirit of vitriol and then precipitating The galreda paracelsi the 
tinctura cranii quercetani the aqua and oleum cranii humani and the 
salt of mans skull which is a perfect cure for the falling sickness 
vertigo lethargy numbness and all head diseases The dose in peony 
water or other convenient vehicle is from a scruple to half a drachm 
There is also the essence of mans skull and the spiritus cerebri humani 
a noble antepileptic made from the brain of a young man slain distilled 
with misletoe and sack The oleum cerebri humani has the virtue of the 
spiritus 
Mans gall an extract of it with spirit of wine dropt into the ear cures 
deafness 
Cor hominis the powder of it drunk cures the epilepsy 
The various ingredients here detailed appear to us horrible 
but instead of looking upon those who used them with con 
tempt should we not rather reecho Harveys noble maxim 
one of the best proofs of the liberality of his mind Not to 
praise or dispraise other anatomists for all did well and 
there was some excuse even for those wbo are in error At a 
time when chemistry was in its earliest infancy some of these 
preparations of the human tissues might serve as a means for 
giving salts which could not otherwise be obtained in an 
isolated form The act of swallowing in a newborn child 
mignt often rouse a latent vitality and this was held to 
prove the value of blood Sperm still acts as a love philtre 
and cowdung poultices are not unknown as applications 
within twenty miles of London The value of blood drunk 
hot as a cure for epilepsy lingers in the mind of the public 
and science teaches us that powdered blood might stop a 
flux
