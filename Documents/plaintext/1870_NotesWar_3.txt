universities so that it would rather tend to depreciate medical educa 
tion at the universities He advocated in opposition to this scheme 
one which is considerably modified from that in practice in Germany 
He thinks that as there the State alone should give the licence to 
practise and that all the powers which the different bodies possess of 
granting such licence after examination should be bought up At the 
same time the State should not examine any candidate with a view to 
licence till he could present a certificate or degree from some recognised 
teaching body In this way while all merely examining boards would 
be supplanted by the State on the other hand the universities and 
other schools would devote themselves to teaching their degree or cer 
tificate not being a licence to practise but merely a certificate of 
having completed a given course of study to the satisfaction of the 
teachers Professor Young also advocated a higher standard of medi 
cal education The difficulty has been raised that there are many parts 
where the remuneration of practice is too low ever to induce men 
of sufficient education to enter the profession To meet this a system 
of increasing the income of such practitioners by a State grant was ad 
vocated and it was suggested that this might well be done by the State 
adding to the subsidy which it at present gives towards supplying paro 
chial medical relief 
NOTES OF THE WAR 
THE SICK AND WOUNDED AT METZ 
OUR Berlin correspondent writes as follows under date Nov 8th 
The special trains for sick and wounded are now going more regularly 
and in greater number Some are arranged by the commissaries of 
evacuation at Weissenburg and are to go between that place and Cha 
lons and Paris The first train of this kind which was fitted out and sent 
by the  Berlin Hiilfsverein has now gone for the third time to fetch 
wounded from Metz On its second course this train brought home 
ninetyeight severely wounded mostly belonging to the first and tenth 
army corps two carriages of it stayed atCourcelles and were destined 
to pass through Metz for Noveant to fetch some of the wounded there 
I am sorry to say that some of the young volunteer nurses who accom 
panied the train caught fever during their expedition to the fieldhos 
pitals It is known through the newspapers what a large number of 
sick are among the garrison and the inhabitants of Metzcases of fever 
hospital gangrene and smallpox so frequent these last months among 
the French are very numerous To prevent the spreading of these dis 
eases the army medical department sent an order immediately after the 
capitulation that the patients in Metz were not to be sent to Germany 
but that other measures were to be taken in behalf of them For this 
purpose a commission is nominated to inspect the hospitals and to 
consider the circumstances as a member of this commission Professor 
Frerichs left Berlin last week 
The Mfedical Schools From the absence of our principal medical 
teachers and of the majority of the students very few of the medical 
classes have been opened at the regular term The Charite in other 
years crowded by students in this month is nearly as lonely as in the 
hot weather and among those who go to the few lectures really 
opened up to the present time the majority are foreigners The course 
of war and politics will decide whether we shall have a regular me 
dical  semester this winter at all 
WarMuseumAmong the measures for the advantage of science 
arising out of the war I may mention the medical and surgical war 
museum established in the  Friedreich WilhelmsInstitut our medical 
school for the army It is expected that every surgeon occupied with 
the troops will collect interesting anatomical preparations as far as time 
and circumstances allow and send them with notes to this museum 
Even now among the post mortem examinations in the  Barracken 
near Berlin a good number of fine specimens are collected  and I am 
informed that the last hospitaltrain brought also a series from the 
hospitals near Metz 
Abuse of tize Red Cross The following is the text of an order 
issued by the King  The red cross of the Convention of Geneva 
is to be worn by no one otherwise than on the armband eg 
not on the cap Wearing the white armband with the red cross even 
when it is stamped does not give the right of travelling freely in 
those parts of France which are occupied by the army When a free 
intercourse of the public is not desirable particularly among the out 
posts on the Etappenroads railways etc the military authorities and 
the gendarmes have to control the legitimation of the wearers of the 
red cross in order to prevent the intercourse of the occupied territory 
with the enemy and to disburden the streets of useless transports The 
legitimation of wearing the red cross band and the legitimation as a 
member of the voluntary aid will be granted in the German armies by 
the royal commissary and military inspector of the voluntary aid Prince 
Pless by the royal military commissary of Bavaria Count Castell 
and by the Wiirtemberg Aid Society Free travelling by rail and re 
quisition of carriages will be allowed to legimated persons only if they 
have a written permission for travelling signed by one of the above 
named authorities or by one of their delegates In case of doubt on 
this point the royal Etappencommander will communicate with the re 
spective local delegates of the aidsocieties The military authorities 
are specially instructed to pay attention to persons who are not Ger 
man subjects wearing the red cross Persons of this kind travelling 
without legitimation by the abovenamed authorities will be arrested as 
suspicious Considering the numerous cases of abuse of the red cross 
and the crowd of battleloafers it seems to be in the interest of those who 
really wish to help that there will be a more strict control in future 
and we are sure that the members of British aidsocieties will not com 
plain of this formality necessary for the advantage of the wounded and 
of themselves 
HOSPITAL AT DARMSTADT 
THE AMain Zeifung a Hesse paper speaks very highly of the Alice Hos 
pital at Darmstadt devoted to the treatment of soldiers suffering from 
internal diseases It is under the protection of the Princess Alice 
 whom says the Zeituing  we are accustomed to see at the head of 
so many philanthropic undertakings and has been established by the 
English Society for the Sick and Wounded in the War The Hessian 
Government granted the necessaryaccommodation and there are usually 
about eighty patients mostly suffering from typhus and dysentery The 
Crown Princess recently visited the hospital on the 2Ist ultimo and in 
spected the wards and the whole of the domestic arrangements as 
also one of Dr Mayos new sick transport cars The staff consists of 
Dr Mayo Fellow of New College Oxford Mr J C Galton Lec 
turer on Comparative Anatomy at the Charing Cross Hospital Mr H 
Rundle formerly HouseSurgeon at Winchester Hospital and Mr 
Atthill Dresser at St Georges Hospital London Some ladies be 
longing to the Hulfsverein manage the household arrangement and 
the nurses of that Society attend on the patients 
THE ENGLISH AMBULANCES AT VERSAILLES 
THE English ambulance writes Dr Russell is to remain at St Ger 
main where it will not have much to do unless there is another sortie 
There is one casea man with an injured finger But the time of 
the surgeons will not be lost Some have set about learning French 
others I believe go round and look at the hospitals There are thirty 
wounded Prussians in the palace close byvery close to the collection 
of antiquities made by the Emperor who has left there something to 
France The waggonshorribly ugly and heavy and contrasting very 
unfavourably with the French ambulancesare parked in the court and 
paradeground flanked by the bronze battery of the Guard Landwehr 
The determination to send all or part to Corbeil has been resisted 
effectually 
THE BERLIN CENTRAL SOCIETY FOR THE AID OF THIE 
SICK AND WOUNDED 
THE managers of the German society at Berlin for the aid of the sick 
and wounded in war have issued a statement of their operations up to 
Oct 23rd of which we have received a copy The station is in connec 
tion with chief depofts at Coblenz Mayence Mannheim and Nancy and 
with branch depots at Saarlouis Saarbriicken Weissenburg Hagenau 
Jouy aux Asches Courcelles Remilly Pont a Mousson Noveant Ars 
sur Aloselle Gorze Ligny Gravelotte St Marie aux Chenes Libra 
mont Sedan Donchery Mouzon Chalons Rheims Epernay Meaux 
Chateau Thierry Corbeil and Versailles During the three months 
from July 23rd to October 23rd there were sent from the central dep6t 
to the other depots 132 consignments to the lazareths 429  to the 
army in the field 33 in all 594 consignments The cost of furnishing 
the consignments has amounted to about 1380000 thalers g201250 
inclusive of the rich contributions of material made by the aidsocieties 
of the free towns and placed at the disposal of the central committee 
The sum does not include the gifts in kind made by societies and pri 
vate individuals an estimate of their value in money will be made on 
another occasion The committee thank the German railway companies 
for the aid afforded them in promptly forwarding their consignments  
especially the directors of the Berlin and Anhalt railway the Berlin 
Potsdam and Magdeburg railway and the Hanover railway The

forwarding by direct transport of woollen and warm clothing to the 
armies in the field has been essentially limited inasmuch as the supply 
has been furnished by the military organisation and thus the hurtful 
operation of the wet and cold weather has been obviated Until this 
was done the central committee believed it to be a part of its duty to 
make provision of this kind in order to prevent serious disease not 
withstanding that it would have involved an outlay of about 500o00 
thalers about 64000 For the evacuation of the lazareths before 
Metz a transport carriage has been fitted out under the superintendence 
of Herr von Honicka and has already proved of service Moveable 
detachments provided with supplies of all kindsmaterials for dress 
ing necessaries for the lazareths woollen clothing medicines and re 
freshments have followed the army before Paris and have endeavoured 
to afford the most practical help to the adjoining lazareths  several 
new detachments have been sent out for the same purpose New 
depots have been established at Chalons Rheims Meaux Chateau 
Thierry and Versailles and new icedepots at Meaux and Nancy A 
large number of properly qualified persons provided with the necessary 
disiiufectants have been sent to the various stations A table of thle 
various articles supplied by the society is given among which are enu

AMBULANCES IN FRANCE 
THE formation of committees for the aid of the sick and wounded has 
made progress in various parts of France such as Lyons Rouen 
Havre etc The evangelical aidcommittee of Paris has proceeded to 
Tours and has established ambulances in Tours Orleans and Chalons 
surMarne In the department of the Arne several landed proprietors 
have established ambulances from their own means 
THE SICK AND IWOUNDED IN DRESDEN 
MOST of the cases of disease among the French prisoners lately brought 
to Dresden were of typhus  there were also several cases of smallpox 
In the three hospitals of the town thereare about i58o sick and 
wounded of whom more than 7oo are French 
THE PROPOSED ROYAL SOCIETY OF 
MEDICINE 
AFTER the conclusion of the ordinary business of the meeting of the 
Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society on Tuesday evening the meeting 
was made special for the purpose of confirming or rejecting the follow 
ing resolution proposed by Mr Paget seconded by Dr Quain and 
passed at a special meeting of the Society on October 25th 
 That the Council be requested to consider whether while main 
taining the charter and constitution of the Royal Medical and Chirur 
gical Society it may be possible to obtain a more complete cooperation 
with the Pathological Obstetrical Clinical and Epidemiological or 
other Societies for the promotion of Medical science 
The minutes of the previous meeting having been read and confirmed 
as to their accuracy 
The PRESIDENT Dr BURROWS read the byelaw of the Society 
referring to the business of special meetings and pointed out that no 
question could be discussed of which notice had not been given 
Dr ROBERT LEE moved and Dr MURCHISON seconded the con 
firmation of the resolution 
Dr GREENHOW asked whether he would be in order in proposing 
an amendment 
The PRESIDENT decided that he would not 
Dr GREENHOW said that he would have given notice had he been 
aware that it was necessary He would at once submit however to 
the Presidents decision With regard to the motion before the meet 
in g if he were convinced that it really expressed the wish of the Society 
he would not oppose it Taking a retrospective view of the scheme 
tracing it through all its stages and pointing out how important a par t 
the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society had taken in promoting it 
he could not help thinking that the resolution did not represent th e 
feeling of the members of the Society He believed it probable that 
many of the members present at the last meeting voted rather from 
personal respect to the proposer than from regard to the merits of the 
question No no He would ask whether it was desirable that the 
amalgamation scheme should be strangled by those who had given birth 
to it 
Dr JOHN WEBSTER remarked that the assent of twothirds of the 
Fellows of the Society present at a general meeting was necessary in 
order to make any change in the laws or constitution of the Society 
Dr BARCLAY hoped that the resolution would not be confirmed 
He would inform the Fellows present that Mr Paget had been asked 
after the last meeting whether he was aware that a plan similar to that 
proposed by him had already been discussed and that the Pathological 
Society had refused its assent unless there were such a change in the 
name and style of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society as would 
place all the Societies on an equal footing He regretted that the 
Council of the Society had presented a mere report without offering 
any advice as to the course which should be followed At the last 
discussion the opponents of the amalgamation scheme had admitted 
the great advantages to the profession which would arise from it They 
had used even stronger language in its favour than he would employ 
and he could not understand why they voted against it It was a great 
pity that if the scheme was to fall through it should be in consequence 
of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society declining to go on with 
it The Society had shown more selfabnegation and had more readily 
laid aside considerations of selfinterest and selfregard than any other 
Society It would then be a pity that the Royal Medical and Chirur 
gical Society should be the first to retreat It was true that there was 
a strong minority among whom were men whose opinions were to be 
respected and perhaps it would be well not to press on the scheme 
too fast If the meeting refused to confirm the resolution the result 
would be to send the matter back to the Council and leave it to them 
to proceed with the scheme in such manner and at such a time as they 
might think advisable 
Dr MOXON thought that the amalgamation scheme was in reality 
not in favour with the Pathological Societythat is to say with those 
members of that Society who ordinarily attended its meetings 
Dr PITMAN said that the question must be looked at from a prac 
tical point of view In order to carry out a scheme of amalgamation 
there must be great unanimity The proposal was not to merely 
change the name of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society but to 
extinguish it and form a new Society This could not be done withou t 
a new charter Was it possible to get one A number of member s 
were opposed to this and therefore he thought it would not be pos  
sible He thought that the Society would be wasting labour if i t 
pushed the scheme further at present 
After some remarks from Mr BROOKE and Dr WYNN WILLIAMS a 
vote was taken when there appeared 
For confirming Mr Pagets resolution   41 
Against  36 
The resolution was therefore confirmed 
ROYAL COLLEGES OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS 
OF EDINBURGH 
THE introductory lecture in the Edinburgh Extraacademical School 
was delivered on November ist by Dr Joseph Bell Dr Gillespie a 
President of the Royal College of Surgeons was in the Chair There 
were also present Dr Halliday Douglas President of the Royal Col 
lege of Physicians and a large numberof members of the medical pro 
fession and of students 
Dr Joseph Bell congratulated the students on their choice of a school 
of medicine Edinburgh had for centuries been a noted centre of edu 
cation and for nearly two hundred years unrivalled in the world as a 
medical school The explanation of this undoubted fact might possibly 
be that the proverbial industry and perseverance of Scotchmen had 
given Edinburgh many hard working and accomplished professors 
but he believed the main reason was because it consisted of two rival 
or apparently rival but really cooperating schools which were so 
near each other as practically to be under the same roof Another 
reason was its concentration He was thankful to be able to tell only 
of gains to the school this year The vacant lectureship had fallen 
into the hands of Mr John Wyllie who after a brilliant student career
