and the Bkitish Medical Journal opportunities of dis 
cussing the social and political questions affecting the 
profession and so by gathering up comparing and 
harmonising the opinions of many men of various 
experiences rendering it possible to go to the public and to 
the Legislature with a settled policy  
I hold every man said Lord Bacon 
 a debtor to his 
profession and no member of the profession has the right 
to say that he takes no interest in what are called  medical 
politics by which we understand the maintenance of the 
honour and of the interests of the medical profession and 
the consolidation and extension of its influence on public 
opinion and on the course of legislation in matters touch 
ing the public health and the scientific and social interests 
of the profession itself The real source of many of the 
disadvantages under which the medical profession in this 
country still labours is traceable to the apathy of many of 
its members who cannot be roused to take a share 
in the determination of matters which lie a little 
outside the absorbing calls of actual practice or of 
clinical work The numerical strength of the Asso 
ciation is great but it ought to be still greater Its 
Branches are doing a great work in bringing men 
together and in affording opportunities for conference and 
discussion but they might be still more useful in these 
respects if members would take more interest in their 
meetings and attend them more regularly Modifications 
in the arrangements for these meetings and in the organisa 
tion of the larger Branches have been made from time to 
time and others may be found desirable If so they can 
be made without difficulty for it should always be remem 
bered that the Association is still a growing organism For 
many years past it has grown steadily in numbers and in 
adaptability to the needs of members and it will we 
believe go on growing in both respects Justification for 
this hope is found in its past history and we may well 
look forward with confidence to the future May we not 
then fairly appeal to those who are still outside its ranks 
to study the aims and methods of the British Medical 
Association and to satisfy themselves whether they may 
not approve the one and whether therefore they should 
not support or perchance lend their aid to improve the

PROFESSOR LOMBROSO ON THE BOERS 
From a study of certain writings of Professor Lombroso we 
had derived the impression that in his eyes the whole 
human race is more or less degenerate or at any rate that 
in any given civilised country the members of the popula 
tion presenting none of the signs which in his opinion in 
dicate degeneracy are rare exceptions We gather however 
from an article by him which appeared in a recent number 
of the Nuova Antologa that he has found one nation which 
fulfils his ideal of perfect manhood To his mind the 
Boers are the coming race  even now they are the salt of 
the earth We know that the Boers look upon themselves 
as the chosen people and they will doubtless think highly 
of the judgment of the Turin Professor who shares that 
belief 
In the opening words of his article Professor Lombroso 
boasts that from the very beginning of the war he main 
tained that in spite of their enormous inferiority in num 
bers they would be victorious This belief it appears was 
largely founded on the fact that they are fighting for a 
just cause which attracts to them the sympathies of the 
whole world translated into men money and perfected 
arms Then they are patriots and therefore of much 
greater value than the English 
 
mercenaries Apparently 
the foreigners who represent a part of the translated 
sympathies aforesaid fight for sentiment Other points 
in the Boers favour are that they can live on 
 
bilitony 
 
sic and that they are habituated to a climate 
fatal to Europeans 
 
Bilitony 
 is an instance of the de 
formations of foreign words and names with which readers 
of Professor Lombroso are painfully familiar and the re 
markable statement about the South African climate gives 
a measure of his accuracy as to facts The poet says 
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just  but Pro 
fessor Lombroso puts the multiplying power of a just 
cause still higher for he says it quadruples the number of 
 the Boers Among their other advantages we are told that 
they enjoy a Government exactly suited to their character 
a statement which strikes us as a doubtful compliment 
 as the Krugerite oligarchy can hardly be regarded as a 
model of political virtue by anyone who knows what 
 honest statecraft means Professor Lombroso describes it 
as an 
 
absolutely free Government  
 
but to those who 
have lived under it the freedom of the Government has 
seemed to be etsercised chiefly in administrative wrong 
doing He speaks of the Boers as a  
meek 
 
people and 
although he does not generally go to Holy Writ for support 
of his opinions it may be on that ground that his prophetic 
soul leads him to foresee that they shall inherit the earth 
When midway through his article the Professor appears 
suddenly to have awakened to the fact that the Boers 
have not been fulfilling his predictions of victory But 
after all that is only a fact and what is fact against so 
pretty a theory as he has framed about the glorious des 
tinies of Mr Krugers burghers Professor Lombroso 
faith in the triumph of the Boers remains unshaken be 
cause 
 
the power of liberty can conduct a chosen people 
like the Boers to victory even against forces forty times 
greater We have already seen that the justice of their 
cause combined with the sustaining properties of bil 
itony quadruples their fighting strength  now defeat 
combined with Professor Lombrosos faith in liberty is to 
make them forty times stronger As he assures us that 
the said faith is indestructible it becomes an interesting 
arithmetical problem to determine what higher multiple 
of four will represent the fighting strength of the Boers 
when they are finally crushed So rooted is his belief in 
his conclusions that he says that even if England after 
one or two years of warfare came out victorious he would 
not change them Whatever their losses maybe Professor 
Lombroso assures the world that the Boers are certain to 
win in the long run because they carry out the biblical 
precept 
 Increase and multiply so successfully that they 
must ultimately form a nation which will  
stagger 
humanity 
 
by its valour and virtue With characteristic in 
capacity to see things as they really are Professor 
Lombroso takes no account of the effects of British rule 
which when the time of blood and iron is overpast will 
transform the Boers into British subjects as loyal as the 
people of Canada

The only defect he sees in his chosen race is an undue 
tenderness in the treatment of their conquered foes This 
tenderness we are given to understand is not reciprocated 
by the brutal Briton Here again we are inclined to agree 
with the professor for we think that such exhibitions of 
amiable weakness as shooting British soldiers under the 
white flag should be dealt with by hanging rather than by 
protests 
Professor Lombroso forsees a dismal future for England 
for victory even if fortune favours her army is sure to end 
in her ruin Carried away by the reactionary force of 
Imperialism she will prefer to industrial progress and to 
the increase of her trade the barbaric crown of military 
glory She will bow the knee before her victorious warriors 
who as soon as they set their conquering foot on their 
native shores will set themselves to upset the Constitution 
These Cassandralike vaticinations will move the British 
people to laughter rather than to alarm May we remind 
Professor Lombroso that we have won battles and 
conquered nations before now and none of these doleful 
consequences which he sees to be in store for us have 
come about There is not we venture to think the slightest 
danger that Lord Roberts will go down to the House of 
Commons and order the SerjeantatArms to take away 
the  bauble  which it is the privilege of that functionary 
to carry  and we doubt if even at the height of his present 
popularity General BadenPowell would be permitted to 
eize Windsor Castle and proclaim himself king 
Rapt into future times the Italian seer beholds rising 
in a majestic vision before his minds eye the United 
States of Africa These are to divide the world with the 
United States of America while the mouldering thrones 
and effete tyrannies and superstitions of degenerate 
Europe crumble into dust He is indeed fain to admit 
that Mr Kruger has sometimes shown an 
 
ultraconserva 
tive tendency while Great Britain is a most important 
centre of civilisation and internal liberty But alas  she 
has in recent years forsaken the glorious traditions of 
Gladstone and as a consequence entered upon a period of 
decadence as Venice did before her She finds it neces 
sary to bind her colonies to her by the bonds of militarism 
and for this reason Professor Lombroso cannot find it in 
his heart to bless her Well as was said of Italy by a 
famous countryman of his Great Britain far  da se a 
phrase which for our present purpose may be taken to 
mean that she will try to do without the blessing of Pro 
cessor Lombroso  
THE THEORY OF IONS 
One meets with much reference to ions in modern chemical 
literature and a few words about the socalled 
 
Ionic 
Hypothesis or the Electrical Dissociation Theory may 
therefore be of interest 
We all know that when an electric current passes 
through such a liquid as a solution of hydrochloric acid 
the dissolved substance is decomposed into components 
in this case hydrogen and chlorine which are set free at 
two quite distinct points in the liquidnamely the 
electrodes or places where the current enters and leav ss 
the solution Since the hydrogen and chlorine are not 
given off at the same place it appears that one or both of 
Ahese elements must have wandered through the liquid 
from the place at which it was liberated to the electrode at 
which it is set free 
An element or group of elements in this wandering 
state divorced from the rest of the original molecule is 
called an ion from the Greek word meaning going 
Some elements or groups of elements such as hydrogen 
the metals and ammonium are always set free at the 
negative electrode and these were called by Faraday 
cations because they go down the positive current 
while other elements or groups of elements such as 
chlorine oxygen sulphion SO and nitrion N03 always 
appear at the positive electrode and were called by Faraday 
 
anions 
 
because they 
 
go up 
 
against the current 
If we assume the cations to be all charged with positive 
electricity their attraction by the negative electrode is 
explained while at the same time the anions must be 
supposed to bear charges of negative electricity which they 
discharge on the positive electrode If we further assume 
I that every atom of hydrogen and the equivalent amount 
of every metal bear exactly the same electrical charge we 
can at once deduce Faradays wellknown electrolytic law 
that the quantity of the ions set free at the electrodes in 
an electrolyte depends solely on the amount of electricity 
that has passed through In fact the ions are the carriers 
of the electric current and each ion can only carry a fixed 
quantity of electricity 
The question that now arises is this  Are these ions free 
only while an electric current is passing through the liquid 
or do they exist in all liquids  The  ionic hypothesis 
 
asserts that all liquids that are capable of being decom 
posed by electricity contain free ions even when they are 
not being subjected to electric influence and that the more 
dilute a solution the greater the percentage of dissociation 
of the dissolved substance into its constituent ions The 
ions are seldom if ever capable of existing apart from op 
positely charged ions Thus the hydrogen ion is held to 
consist of one atom only while free hydrogen consists of 
molecules each of which contains two atoms Thus a solu 
tion of hydrogen and chlorine in water contains molecules 
of each of these elements while a solution of hydrochloric 
acid contains atoms of each of the elementsKascent 
hydrogen may perhaps contain hydrogen ions or atoms 
at themoment of liberation but they quickly pair off into 
molecules 
There must always be an equal number of atoms of 
sodium and chlorine in a solution of sodium chloride in 
order that the positive charges of electricity on the sodium 
atoms may when added together be held bound by the 
negative charges on the chlorine atoms If by any means 
the number of chlorine atoms be increased beyond this 
number the extra chlorine atoms will combine in pairs 
forming ordinary chlorine gas Thus ionic dissociation 
does not alter the percentage composition of a salt 
Many of the ions are supposed to have a complicated 
structure thus all the sulphates are assumed in solution 
to contain sulphion S04 which is not known in the free 
state but when liberated at an electrode in presence of 
water immediately yields oxygen and sulphuric acid In 
like manner all acetates are supposed to contain the 
highly complex ion acetoxyl C2H302 which of course 
is not known as an independent substance 
If the ionic hypothesis be true then metallic salts in very
