THE ARMY MEDICAL SERVICE 
To the branch of the profession engaged in medical practice in the 
army the year I882 has been by no means an uneventful one In the 
early part of this period at the beginning of the month of April a 
change occurred in the direction of the Army Medical Department 
Sir William Muir KCB who acted as its chief for a year beyond 
the allotted term of seven years having received the appointment in 
April I874 was succeeded by SurgeonGeneral Thomas Crawford the 
present DirectorGeneral It was during the tenure of office of Sit 
William Muirs predecessor Sir Galbraith Logan that the disruption 
of the old arrangement of the department into staff and regimental 
officers and the unification of the medical body into a single corps had 
occurred  and when Sir Wlilliam Muir took over the Directorship he 
found the new system established but requiring much still to be done 
to give it due consistence and to bring it into harmony with the work 
ing of other parts of the military machine At the time the new system 
of army medical organisation was introduced the present Director 
General Dr Crawford held the post of head of the medical branch 
at the central office in Whitehall Yard  and the views entertained by 
him at the present time on the subject may be fairly assumed from a 
recollection of this circumstance It was not without surmounting 
great difficulties and overcoming very powerful opposition in high 
quarters that the reformed system of administration as its supporters 
regarded it was introduced  and Sir Galbraith Logan as its parent 
had personally to encounter much obloquy which was continued to his 
successor when it was found he was determined to follow in the same 
path The influence of the opponents of the new system who reckoned 
among their numbers not only the majority of the combatant officers 
of regiments but also many medical officers who preferred the pre 
viously existing mixed regimental and staff organisation of the depart 
ment together with a general feeling of dissatisfaction among the 
medical officers at the derogatory and in many respects unfair manner 
in which they were treated relatively to officers of other parts of the 
military service had led for several years to a dearth of candidates for 
commissions in the army medical ranks The evils which this state of 
things brought about were frequently commented on in Parliament and 
at last under pressure of the need for a better supply of aspirants for 
medical commissions and the representations made by various public 
bodies among which the British Medical Association took a prominent 
part the Government felt itself constrained to issue a Royal Warrant 
removing most of the grievances complained of This concession which 
emanated from the War Department towards the latter part of the time 
when Sir William Muir was DirectorGeneral restored contentment in 
the medical service and there has been no want of candidates for com 
missions in it since but among the provisions of the new warrant was 
one which had for its object to defeat any repetition of a similar demon 
stration on the part of the profession such as had been made before 
the warrant was granted This was accomplished by partly closing the 
door of entrance by open competition and substituting for it a power 
of nominating in the future a proportion of medical officers to commis 
sions instead On the occasion of the first competitive examination of 
candidates in the past year 1882 an attempt was made to show that 
the fact of no surgeons having commissions conferred on them without 
competition was a breach of the nomination clause of the warrant  and 
we found it necessary to expose in the JOURNAL the fallacy of these 
assertions and to indicate the trouble to the authorities as well as dis 
content in the medical schools of the kingdom which would have in 
evitably followed such a course had it been adopted It would be out 
of place in a summary of this kind to refer further to the changes in 
organisation of the Army Medical Department  but it has been neces 
sary so far to advert to them inasmuch as during the latter part of the 
year which has just passed away an agitation has arisen backed by 
very powerful supporters for a return to the old system of departmental 
administration in consequence of the breakdown as it is alleged of 
the existing system during the late campaign in Egypt On this subject 
some remark3 will be made presently 
About the month of May 1882 accusations of inattention and mis 
conduct on the part of men of the Army Hospital Corps in South 
Africa during an outbreak of enteric fever which occurred among some 
of the troops who had been left in occupation after the close of the 
Boer campaign were freely commented upon in various newspapers 
The subject was referred to in Committee of Supply on the Army 
Estimates and an influential opinion was expressed that the short 
service system did not work well in the Army Hospital Corps A 
Departmental Committee with Sir Evelyn Wood KCB as the 
chairman was appointed by the Secretary o State for War to inquire 
into the occurrences complained of and though no report on the sub 
ject was published it was understood that the general charges against 
the men of the corps fell to the ground under the investigation All 
that could be proved was that there had been faults in some particular 
individuals but it was at the same time shown that these had been 
noticed and adequately punished at the time they had occurred Sub 
sequently the inquiry by this committee was led to assume a wider 
range and the Secretary for War Mr Childers stated in the House 
of Commons that the whole question of the organisation of the corps 
had now been submitted toit for consideration The Committee were still 
engaged on this question when their proceedings were interrupted by 
the services of the chairman and some of the members being otherwise 
required in connection with the arrangements for the approaching 
campaign in Egypt 
The Egyptian campaign remarkable in its military aspect for the 
rapidity with which its objects were accomplished led to severe 
criticisms on the working of the medical department of the army 
A general cry was raised that the medical service had  broken down 
All sorts of charges were made against it Hospitals were said to have 
been quite destitute of medical comforts operations to have been per 
formed without the use of chloroform patients left without ordinary 
attention and invalids on the voyage home to have been halfstarved 
from not being able to get the kinds of food which were necessary for 
them None of these accusations so freely uttered could be substan 
tiated when they were sifted We ourselves undertook a searching 
inquiry into the subject questioning in considerable detail invalid sol 
diers and officers as well as hospital orderlies and nurses who had 
been in Egypt and the result of the investigation was published in 
the JOURNAL of the 2ISt of October last As there shown sufficient 
proof was afforded that there was no justification for the allegation 
that the hospital service had broken down and as to the assertions of 
there having been a dearth of chloroform medicines medical neces 
saries and comforts they were simply untrue The Commanderin 
Chief Sir Garnet Wolseley in his report of September 24th at the 
termination of the war testified that  the medical departmenit under 
SurgeonGeneral lIanbury CB had done everything that could pos 
sibly be done for the care and comfort of the sick and wounded and 
this official tribute was confirmed by the strong sympathy evinced by 
the civil members of the profession in the memorable banquet which 
was given by them to the medical officers of the Egyptian Expedition 
in London This banquet was attended by all the heads of the pro 
fession in the metropolis and a large number of eminent provincial 
practitioners 
The medical officers of the British service worked under immense 
difficulties in the expedition The Army Medical Department had 
provided for the wants of the campaign on an extensive and elaborate 
scale and especially had despatched a hospital shipthe Calthage 
equipped with every requisite for a large number of sick and wounded 
patients But the movements of this vessel were not under the con 
trol of the medical department and at a time of urgent need she was 
left behind at Alexandria for reasons with which the medical service 
had no concern The CommanderinChief had considered it neces 
sary to keep the change of his base from Alexandria to Ismailia a pro 
found secret and as soon as he had secured a footing at Ismailia had 
fouud himself obliged to advance and engage the enemy so that a con 
siderable number of wounded required immediate care and attention 
These sudden demands were responded to and the difficulties connected 
with them overcome in a manner that should call forth admiration 
considering the circumstances in which the medical officers concerned 
were placed It is all the more remarkable that the special wants thus 
created were supplied as well as they were when it is remembered that 
the medical department has no opportunities afforded to it of gaining 
in time of peace the experience which alone can make things work 
smoothly as well as succsssfully in time of war In every other part of 
the army it is admitied as a matter of course that the actual estab 
lishments which will have to be employed on active service in the 
field should be rehearsed from time to time during peace But even 
when field operations are practised on the largest scale in which they 
are ever practised in England it is never considered by the military 
authorities to be necessary for bearer companies field hospitals or 
other field medical establishments to take part in the practice The 
more the discussion has been carried on in the public press regarding 
the alleged failures of the Army Medical Department during the late 
war the more it has been rendered apparent that the defects in the 
medical service whatever they may have been have not been due to 
faults of the medical officers themselves but to the fact that they 
have no separate and integral organisation of their own as other parts 
of the military service have Such defects in the service in Egypt as 
have occurred have been due to the want of autonomy in the depart 
ment and of control over the transport and other materials which are 
essential for its even working in war time and the evil results that 
are inevitable under such conditions when the pressure of war has to

be met have been foretold in the writings of our best military surgeons 
over and over again As soon as the outcry against the medical de 
partment broke out some military surgeons were led to advocate a 
return to the old regimental system of organisation while military 
officers have been tracing the defects of the medical service to the 
want of more military control over the hospital establishments  but 
it is obvious that no change of organisation much less a return to sys 
tems which are incompatible with modern arrangements can improve 
matters so long as the only possible method of medical officers gaining 
experience in field duties practice in time of peace is withheld from 
the department An official inquiry is again proceeding on the sub 
ject and it may be hoped that it will lead to the Government and the 
public becoming impressed with the conviction that it is a false economy 
not to afford the means which alone can enable the medical depart 
ment to work as smoothly and efficiently when it is subjected to the 
strain of war as other departments of the army are enabled to do 
The Committee which as we have already mentioned was originally 
constituted under the presidency of Sir Evelyn Wood to inquire into 
alleged neglects on the part of the Army Hospital Corps in South 
Africa has been again further expanded and placed under the direc 
tion of the Earl of MIorley Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State 
The scope of its inquiries has been enlarged so as to comprehend the 
whole question of hospital management and nursing in the field as 
well as the seatransport of sick and wounded It was stated in the 
House of Commons that the Committee is also to ascertain what defi 
ciencies if any existed in the field or other hospitals or in the hos 
pital ships and invalid transports during the Egyptian campaign with 
a view to future remedy Evidence is in the course of being taken 
on these subjects and shortly before the last session of Parliament 
closed it was announced that great efforts would be made to have the 
report completed by next session The inquiry of this Committee is 
not merely a medical concern it is rather one that concerns the 
interests of the whole army as well as the character of the country at 
large and we trust that a right solution of the important questions 
under its consideration will shortly be attained 
The hospital service of the laree Indian contingent which took part in 
the Egyptian Expedition not only escaped without the animadversion 
which the sister service of the British forces evoked but met with ex 
pressions of praise on all sides This happy circumstance was doubt 
less due to the fact that the experience of continual fieldservice in 
India had taught what was necessary for efficiency and because a 
greater liberality in the constitution of the Indian fieldhospital esta 
blishments as well in the Jersonnzel as in stores and transport had 
rendered them selfreliant and comparatively independent Each of 
the Indian fieldhospitals regarded as an unit was complete within itself 
possessing the means of supplying all its wants and it is not a matter 
for wonder therefore that they accomplished their work with less 
friction than other establishments could do which were dependent on 
a variety of other departments for their working and efficiency 
One other point connected with the history of military medical events 
during the past year must be alluided to and we must then close this 
part of the summary For many years past the question of eftfcting 
an amalgamation between the home and Indian branches of the mili 
tary medical service has been under discussion To accomplish this 
fusion has been manifestly a desirable object ever since the rule of 
India was transferred from the Honourable East India Company to 
the Crown  not merely for the purpose of simplification of medical 
administration in the military forces of India but also in the interests 
of pecuniary economy The difficulties in the way of bringing about the 
union for a long time appearsd insuperable owing especially to the 
rights of the natives guaranteed in the act of transfer to compete for 
commissions in the Indian Medical Service while they were disqualified 
for commissions in the British army Some steps towards a coalition 
have however been gained of late so that during the last war in 
Afghanistan the British and Indian Army Medical Departments were 
both together solely directed by one headviz the Principal Medical 
Officer of the British Forces in India The way towards amalgama 
tion of the two services has been further cleared of late by a partial 
separation of the Indian medical department into military and civil 
branches and on Dr Crawford during whose period of administration 
in India these changes had occurred becoming DirectorGeneral it was 
known that efforts would be made to carry out the system which had 
thus commenced to its legitimate conclusion Shortly before the 
present DirectorGenerals return to England the Indian Government 
had sent home its scheme of reorganisation of the medical department 
on the principle of unification of the British and Indian services The 
War Office and the Horse Guards were believed to object to many of 
the articles embodied in this scheme and although the correspondence 
was carried on confidentially it was generally understood that the dis 
cussions on the subject were being carried on between the central 
authorities in England and the Government of India up to the time 
when the preparations had to be made for the Egyptian campaign 
The subject of the amalgamation of tbe two services was then allowed 
to drop for a time but is now we understand on the eve of being 
resumed and in the interest of India itself as well as in the interest 
of the officers of a department to whom India owes so much of its 
present development and prosperity it is to be sincerely hoped that no 
long time will be allowed to elapse before the questions in dispute are 
settled and the medical services of that vast country both civil and 
military placed on a settled and satisfactory basis 
THE NAVAL IMEDICAL SERVICE 
THERE has been some reaction in favour of this service from 
which it may be inferred that the Order in Council of i88o has had 
beneficial results as there have been more candidates and fewer resig 
nations after experience of the service Still the active force remains 
at about 25 per cent under established strength  but as many as have 
been advertised for have been entered so that the new policy would 
appear to be to keep down the staff to working necessities 
Deaths have happened on or from active service to two deputy 
inspectorsgeneral one fleetsurgeon and one staffsurgeon of whom 
it may be said that all are losses to the service DeputyInspector 
General Hill died in charge of AMalta Hospital of chronic dysentery 
contracted on service in lapan DeputyInspectorGeneral Cotton of 
hepatic and enteric disease displaying itself when in charge at Ply 
mouth Hospital FleetSurgeon Dr Anderson in charge of the Marine 
Infirmary at Walmer and StaffSurgeon Connell in Japan waters 
The credit of the Medical Department has been well sustained in thc 
bombardment of Alexandria and on sh9re in Egypt at the ports where 
the sick and wounded have been received and in the fighting at 
Kassassin and TelelKebir respectively for which Dr Shaw of the 
flagship was awarded the decoration of CB without promotion and 
two junior officers have been raised each a step in rank The manner 
in which the service in general and especially in the affairs preparatory 
to the Egyptian expedition has been executed so satisfactorily to the 
Government that its chiefDr Watt Reidhas received Knighthood 
of the Order of the Bath from Her Gracious Majesty 
Amid such general approval and propitious outlook it is to be re 
gretted that dissatisfaction is louclly expressed at the allotment of pen 
sions that have fallen vacant 
MILITIA SURGEONS 
IN January i88i a clause was issued in the Militia Regulations for that 
year stating that all militia medical officers on the departmental list 
should be compelled to retire when they reached the age of sixtyfive 
This clause was at complete variance with the Warrant of 1876 and 
the several Acts under which militia surgeons held their appoinitments 
and was as they considered uiltra vires and at variance with all rules 
of equity and lawdepriving them from no fault of theirs of incomes 
ranging from ioo to 350 ayear and in many instances leaving them 
destitute of any means of livelihood Some of the militia surgeons 
therefore headed by the President of the Militia Surgeons Society 
issued a circular to all the members and militia surgeons both past and 
present urging them to cooperate and subscribe funds to bring the 
matter before the Secretary of State for War and the House of Com 
mons We are sorry to find that but a very small proportion of the 
militia surgeons responded many from want of means and others be 
lieving it was hopeless to expect any redress as they had been re 
peatedly denied such from previous Secretaries for War IIowever a 
sufficient sum was subscribed to enable them to submit a case to two 
eminent Queens Counsel and although their opinion was adverse to 
presenting a petition of rights they both considered the militia sur 
geons had good legal and equitable grounds for pensions of six shillings 
aday as granted by Acts of Parliament extending from George II to 
Victoria 1876 at which time all these Acts were repealed and the 
militia were brought under the authority of the Crown  but this was 
in no way retrospective or took away previous rights 
The Secretary for War although appealed to by the Chairman of the 
Parliamentary Bills Committee supported by several members of Par 
liament having declined to receive any deputation or to allow the case 
of the militia surgeons to be stated personally to him a petition was 
prepared numerously signed and presented to the House of Commons 
about April of this year and was supported by numerous petitions from 
several of the l censing bodies in the United Kingdom and fromBranches 
of the British Medical Association The Secretary for War in conse 
quence of a strong representation made to him by several members of 
Parliament and by the Chairman of the Parliamentary Bills Committee
