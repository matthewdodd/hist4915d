ROYAL COMMISSION ON PHYSICAL TRAINING 
IN SCOTLAND 
This Commission which had held its former sittings in 
London in private has recently conducted its investigations 
in Edinburgh and Glasgow under the chairmanship of the 
Earl op Mansfield Representatives of the press were 
admitted 
A large number of witnesses were examined including 
masters of schools of every grade and various denominations  
officers of His Majestys Army of municipalities and of the 
Boys Brigade university professors medical officers of i 
health and constables The evidence was virtually unani 
mous in favour of extended physical education the diver 
gences of opinion had to do mainly with the form which this 
should take and the practicability of rendering it com 
pulsory 
The first witness was Dr Almond who has been Headmaster 
of Loretto since 1862 He was not in favour of a uniform 
castiron system of physical or any other training in schools 
He believed rather in exercises which would fit a lad for 
military life than in soldier work done at school  he thought 
that a great deal more rifleshooting was advisable He 
stated that during the thirty years or so in which the school 
had kept physical records there had been a gain of fully an 
inch in the chest girth of the boys admitted a result which 
he attributed to greater attention now paid in preparatory 
schools to outdoor exercises Dr Almond considered that 
football was of great value in promoting the military spirit 
while golf was a selfish game which did not cultivate the moral 
or social qualities He thought that the ordinary cadet uniform 
was too tight across the chest and too cumbrous and had 
obtained permission from the War Office to substitute a 
simple Norfolk jacket for it at Loretto 
Mr Roderick Ross Chief Constable of Edinburgh said 
that juvenile crime in Edinburgh was steadily increasing 
He was in favour of organized games in the parks 
MajorGeneral Sir Ian Hamilton insisted that though 
physical training was invaluable it depended for its full 
effect upon a full stomach  the satisfactory result obtained in 
the army was in his opinion in some measure due to the 
regular hours and wholesome food He was strongly in favour 
of attending to the physical aptitudes of the Scottish youth 
not only in the Stateaided schools but also for some time 
after leaving school He ardently wished to see physical 
training made compulsory not only in the curriculum of the 
schools but also as a continuation training He said that the 
Boer lads of from 12 to 15 were young vipers and had sent 
many a good man to his account and he saw no reason why 
under favourable conditions Scottish boys of 15 should not 
make useful soldiers General Hamilton did not anticipate 
any difficulty from religious bias as he believed that the 
Church of Scotland would be quick to realize that physical 
training with a military tendency would afford many of the 
advantages and none of the disadvantages of conscription 
He hoped in fact that the press and the ministers would 
recommend the people to give this scheme a fair trial He 
was strongly of opinion that physical exercises in the 
continuation classes should be compulsory otherwise the 
unruly and dissipated element which it was particu 
larly desirable to secure would escape Sir Ian Hamil 
ton went on to compare the English and German cadets 
whomhe had inspected within three weeks of each other 
at Sandhurst and Potsdam respectively The latter were in 
his opinion infinitely belter in all their exercises though 
eighteen months to two years younger than the Sandhurst 
corps Although he believed our native qualities to be better 
than those of the Germans the system of physical training 
which the latter had to undergo was far superior to our own  
some of the exercises too wer specially devised to test their 
nerve He considered that drill was a better training than 
games because in the latter it was next to impose i ble to really 
test a boys progress 
Professor Bower of the University of Glasgow spoke of 
the great difficulties under which athletics were there carried 
on Many students were deterred from joining the clubs by 
the expense of the subscriptions  others were prevented from 
playing owing to the extent of the curriculum the time table 
of which left them no leisure for games As a result their 
physique was generally poor and this bid fair to become 
worse as it was about to become necessary for the univeraity 
to build upon the athletic ground Personally he attached so 
much importance to physical training as to consider it a 
necessity 
Dr H J Spenser Rector of the Glasgow High School  
strongly advocated the formation of cadet corps or similar 
military organizations wherever possible both on national 
and moral grounds He stated that the difference between 
the English and Scotch boy was that while the former was 
encouraged to play games the latter had in many cases to 
encounter parental prejudice and opposition on this point 
Mr W Cecil Laming Rector of Kelvinside Academy con 
sidered that the Government ought to encourage and improve 
rifle shooting by members of cadet corps He was of opinion 
that from a moral point of view football was of greater im 
portance than either gymnastics or military drill 
Mr George S Deverell Superintendent of the 
Clyde 
training ship Empress said that he thought the physical 
training of the class of boys who came under his care was of 
equal importance with their mental training He urged that 
for their own benefit and that of the eountry every boy and 
girl should be compelled to learn and pass a certain standard 
of gymnastica before being allowed to leave school 
Mr W L Caine Headmaster of George Watsons College 
Edinburgh complained that the physical training of his 
boys was hampered by the exigent demands of the Education 
Department 
Mr Edwin Temple Rector of Glasgow Academy advocated 
compulsory drill and thought that all boys between the ages 
of 12 and 18 should be taught how to handle a rifle This 
would obviate the introduction of conscription which he 
thought impossible in the form in which it existed in France 
and Germany 
The Lord Provqst of Glasgow stated that the number of 
youths between the ages of 12 and 21 annually convicted at 
the policecourts of that city was on the increase the 
majority of the culprits showed poor physical development 
He did not think compulsion in the way of physical 
training possible but suggested that much improvement 
would result if direct instruction in behaviour to one 
anotherwere given to school children He thought that if 
the school playgrounds were left open for their use many 
loafers might be induced to desert the streets 
Mr Thomas W Cuthbertson Secretary of the Boys 
Brigade referred to the physical advantages achieved by his 
organization with good results to the morals of the lads He 
did not think it advisable that physical training should be 
made compulsory in continuation schools as many of the 
scholars had been doing hard physical work all day 
Miss Mary Anderson Headmistress of Ferguslie HalfTime 
School Paisley was of opinion that physical training was so 
important that it ought to be increased by taking half an 
hour off arithmetic 
Canon Mackintosh and other principals of Roman Catholic 
institutions were heartily in favour of physical training which they thought should be canied out by the ordinary 
teachers of the school wherever possible They did not all 
think it advisable to make this compulsory It was stated 
that many of the Roman Catholic parents were in favour of 
volunteering but opposed to soldiering 
Mr R E Thomas Chief Instructor in Physical Exercises 
under the Leeds School Board stated that over 50000 scholars 
in that city received physical instruction and those in the 
upper standards VI and VII were also taught to swim He 
considered that physical training was better than games for im 
proving the general standard as opposed to the development 
of individuals Great care must be exercised in the selection 
of the method of training  both Swedish and military drill 
were too severe if unmodified 
Dr R W Bruce Medical Officer to the Glasgow School 
Board pointed out that if physical training were made com 
pulsory a general medical inspection would be desirable 
Sir William Turner had no hesitation in stating that 
physical exercise was of the highest importance in connexion 
with the development of the body generally A certain 
period of each day should be set aside for body training so 
that the best use might be made of the mind 
Other witnesses referred to the value of manual training in

THE EPIDEMIC OF BERIBERI IN THE BOER 
CAMP AT ST HELENA 
In reference to Dr Patrick Mansons paper on the prophy 
laxis and treatment of beriberi being the opening contribu 
 tion to the discussion on beriberi in the Section of Tropical 
Diseases at the Manchester meeting1 Dr W A Wheeler 
Civil Surgeon in Charge of the Boer Camp in St Helena has 
described his experiences of the epidemic of this disease 
which occurred among the Boers there The facts as he 
jbelieves fully agree with Dr Mansons theory as to the pro 
duction of the disease by place infection 
 At first only a few isolated cases of beriberi occurred in the 
campt Dead Wood Plain but at the time of his arrival 
there in May 1902 the disease had become epidemic and a 
new isolation camp was established of which he had com 
mand and in which he had on an average 75 cases to treat 
In regard to etiology Dr Wheeler believes that all the 
causes ordinarily ascribed might be eliminated As far as 
alcoholism was concerned the Boers were well known to be a 
temperate race and as prisoners of war they had no possible 
means of obtaining alcoholic drinks and every man re 
turning to camp after leave of absence was strictly searched 
Rice was at no time issued as partof the rations Arsenic 
was carefully tested for in the drinking water with a negative 
result and if any had been present in tinned foods the home 
troops would have suffered equally as the rations for 
soldiers and Boers were identical Malaria was ordinarily 
unknown in St Helena and although it was common in 
someparts of South Africavet careful questioning of each 
patient in no case elicited a history of this disease 
On the other hand the conditions existing among the Boers 
would lend great countenance to the theory of place infec 
tion resulting in the development of a toxin outside 
the body The Boers had been confined to one camp 
of 3000 men for over two years The greatest care was 
taken as regards drainsge latrines removal of night soil 
etc but even so the grouud could not possibly have 
escaped being fouled during this long time Again the 
large majority of those attacked were old men so to 70 
men who in their own country had been accustomed to 
a free active life but who now as prisoners moped took no 
exercise ate and slept too much and stayed mostly day and 
night in small huts with every aperture closed They never 
washed their bodies and never changed their clothes Conr 
ditions such as these in conjunction with fouled ground 
would naturally bring about a state of affairs favourable to 
the production of a toxin The mosquito could be eliminated 
in this case for the camp was at an elevation of 2000 ft 
and a strong sea breeze was constantly blowing Dr Wheeler 
had never seen a mosquito there but vermin of other kinds 
were there in plenty 
The theory of place infection was also strongly borne out 
by the fact that on moving the invalids to a site hitherto 
unoccupied a most rapid and marvellous improvement took 
place The earlier cases had been sent to Jamestown Station 
Hospital at sea level and a fair number of these died  but 
41ter the establishment of the isolation camp at Dead Wood 
Plain there was not a single death every man recovered 
cjinpletely some in a weekor so others more slowly 
The treatment consisted solely in this change of location 
and in giving extra diet 1 tin of milk 2 oz of oatmeal and 
3 oz of whisky to each man 
As regards the ordinary diet it was at no time deficient 
 
and was identical with that of the home troops encamped 
on the same groundnamely fresh meat four days a week 
tinned meat two days vegetables and potatoes on alternate 
daysbread sugar and coffee It is true the vegetables were 
compressed and the potatoes were often not too good 
With regard to the water supply  on careful analysis this  
was found to be rather suspicious  both free and albuminoid  
ammonia were too high and there was too much chlorides  it 
was however passable However after the outbreak of beri  
beri among the Boers and of enteric among our troops only 
distilled water was 
supplied 
 With regard to the clinical symptoms  every case with two 
exceptions was of the dropsical variety and in many cases 
there was rapid oedema of the scrotum and penis The scrotum 
often swelled so enormously as to require punctures There 
was no retention no albuminuria no marked anaemia no 
marked paralysis except in two cases mentioned above  but 
always numbness and often complete anaesthesia of the legs 
great pain over the tibiae and the sternum and in the worst 
cases dyspnoea Appetite was good and the bowel functions 
normal The spleen was not enlarged 
In about 30 per cent of the cases the gums were spongy 
and the calves of the legs hard The two exceptional cases 
showed marked ataxic symptoms rapid emaciation and a 
lemon tint of the skin like that of pernicious anaemia But 
these also recovered entirely 
The following points were of most importance as bearing on 
the question of place infection 1 Nearly all the patients 
were old men 50 to 70 worn out by hardships and mental 
anxiety  2 the proverbial dislike of ordinary Boer to clean 
liness and ventilation 3 the prolonged residence on the 
same camping ground though the sanitation and food and 
water supply were carefully looked after  4 the total absence 
of any similar disease among the home troops encamped on 
adjacent land equally crowded sleeping on bare ground but 
accustomed to bathing parades and by nature cleanly  5 the 
epidemic of enteric among the troops at the same time as the 
outbreak of beriberi occurred among the Boers  6 the 
marked recovery of even the most acute cases after their re 
moval to fresh ground and the addition to the ordinary diet 
as compared with the considerable mortality among those at 
first sent to Jamestown 
 
 Colonel Williamson PMO Capetown laid considerable 
stress on the fact that 26 out of 78 cases then in the beriberi 
camp had come from the Potchefstrom district of the Trans 
vaal where a mild form of beriberi was supposed to be 
endemic But it is hardly likely that a man could carry a 
latent disease for three years 
In regard to Dr Mansons observations on the relation 
between beriberi sleeping sickness and malaria Dr Wheeler 
writes After having been in constant attendance on the 
beriberi camp for two months I went down to Jamestown 
one day when I was not feeling very well having had sub 
acute malaria for a few days In Jamestown I remarked to 
another medical man that I had a severe pain in the 
calf of my right leg and jokingly said I believe I 
have got beri beri myself I did not feel inclined for lunch 
and walked back to camp a distance of six miles up an ascent 
of 2000 ft When I arrived home I collapsed completely 
went straight to bed and did not waken for twentyfour hours  
then I slept again for three whole days without food or drink 
On the fourth day I wakened in hospital perfectly well except 
for slight numbness in the right arm and leg and pain in the 
wrists Drugs or alcoholism could be entirely excludedj I 
have always been strictly temperate and the causation 
puzzled everyone For myself I put it down to sheer exhaus 
tion but the paper referred to has suggested a possible con 
nection with beriberi I was never unconscious  only always 
wanted to sleep Three days of constant feeding made me 
absolutely well again in fact in better form than I had been 
for a long time 
 
During a residence of six years in tea districts in India I 
have naturally seen a large number of cases of the disease 
known there as beriberi and of malaria in all its forms I 
have also as a visitor seen the form of beriberi common in 
Singapore but this epidemic in St Helena has exhibited 
features very different from those in the other countries The 
icutenees of the cases the rapid recovery on removal to fresh 
ground the absence of all factors hitherto considered causa 
uve with the notable exception of that of fouled ground and 
personal uncleanliness is most remarkable
