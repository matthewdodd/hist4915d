THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR 
BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER 
II 
THE LINE OF ADVANCE 
THE transports are still arriving Thousands of troops and 
horses guns and ammunition field hospitals and all the other 
equipment of a great army corps have already been landed on 
the shores of South Africa Of the reinforcements a portion 
have gone to Durban and a larger portion are being retained 
to make up the invading column from the South which will 
enter the Free State and subsequently the Transvaal From 
Capetown to De Aar the railway is still open and should be 
well defended as it passes entirely through the Cape Colony 
De Aar is the junction on the main line for Kimberley and is 
one of the advanced depots for Sir R Bullers column The 
distance from Capetown is nearly 500 miles further east 
wards on the main lines some 70 miles is Naauwpoort the 
junction for the Free State This also is securely held and 
used as an advanced depot 
KIMBERLEY 
Information is now to hand that a forward movement having 
for its object the relief of the garrison at Kimberley has 
already commenced This is welcome intelligence andmay 
be regarded as the first step in that forward advance which 
lies before us Kimberley is situated in the midst of rolling 
grass plains on the borders of the Free State these plains 
extend in all directions to the east as far as Bloemfontein and 
beyond that again to the Basutoland border to the north into 
Bechuanaland to Vryburg Mafeking and beyond to the 
south to the Orange River and to the west to the sandy wastes 
of Nemaqualand Here and there on the surface of these ele 
vated plains isolated ironstone kopjes hills and rocky ridges 
are dotted but these may always be avoided and for the most 
part this country is admirably suited for the operations of 
cavalry and for that manipulation of a disciplined army which 
is so invaluable in warfare 
 Kimberley itself is peculiarly situated On the one side 
are the Kimberley and De Beers mines and their works 
which with the floors on which the blue ground from the 
mines is deposited occupy several square miles the whole of 
which is lit up with electric light and overlooked by watch 
towers At a distance of some two miles from Kimberley 
and its two mines is situated the suburb of Beaconsfield with 
the Dutoitspan and Bultfontein mines Between these two 
townships is situated the sanatorium which is the head 
quarters of the garrison Over the sanatorium and also over 
the De Beers rock shaft are two commanding watch towers 
from which men continually survey the whole surrounding 
grass country through telescopes The advance of the enemy 
is thus observed at a distance of many miles and with the 
addition of search lights at night Kimberley is kept con 
stantly advised of the movements of the enemy 
The two principal incentives to the Boers to seize Kim 
berley are doubtless the capture of Mr Rhodes and the stock 
of diamonds which they would hope to obtain Mr Rhodes 
as we are informed feels perfectly secure with his  troop of 
horse  and the rest of the garrison against the attacks of his 
enemies and the Boers are probably not aware that the stock 
of diamonds has been removed to Capetown and that should 
they desire to possess themselves of the precious gems they 
will have in addition to capturing Kimberley to undertake 
the necessary mining operations to do so Nevertheless it is 
certain that the relief of Kimberley at an early date is emi 
nently desirable in the interests of the health of the town 
Although the attacks of the Boers have been absurdly in 
effectual they have succeeded in cutting off the main water 
supply and keeping the place closely invested The effect of 
this is that the inhabitants of Kimberley will probably 
have been compelled in some measure to resort to wells 
for drinking water and although supplies are said to be forth 
coming in abundance it is doubtful whether fresh meat 
can be as freely obtainable as might be desired The population 
shut up in Kimberley is a large one over 20000 and includes 
with the De Beers employees several thousand natives The 
sanitary system of Kimberley is the pail system and involves 
the removal nightly by a sanitary service of the night soil 
this is carted some distance out of the town and there de 
posited on the veld It is questionable whether the town is so 
invested as to interfere with this service though if it be so 
some temporary discomfort and even menace to health might 
arise from this source Kimberley once relieved and the 
lines of communications freely opened up it would be an ex 
tremely valuable base for marching on Bloemfontein the 
capital of the Free State From Kimberley to Bloemfontein 
the distance is under ioo miles and the country which is 
entirely open would afford an admirable route for the advance 
of a column 
Kimberley has a hospital with 3oo beds and many other 
buildings capable of conversion into temporary hospitals 
Should the column proceed from here there is no doubt it will 
form a most suitable spot for a military hospital on the line of 
communications 
RAILWAY TRANSPORT 
The most momentous question for the Army Medical Ser 
vice as well as to all other branches of the Army Corps is at 
what point if any short of Bloemfontein and later Pretoria 
the railway will finally have to be abandoned Will the 
advancing column be able to repair and use the railway as 
they go along carrying their zolling stock and repairing 
material with them or will a point be reached beyond which 
repair in any reasonable period of time will become imprac 
ticable So long as the rail is directly in touch with the 
army and communication by rail with the advanced dep6ts 
of De Aar or Naauwpoort remains open the wounded and sick 
can be moved without discomfort in a few easy stages to 
Capetown or Port Elizabeth Once there they can either be 
accommodated in temporary hospitals on land or in one of 
the hospital ships But once the rail head is left the dis 
posal of sick and wounded will become a more difficult matter 
Travelling in a hospital train if not luxury is far from being 
positive discomfort but travelling by waggon over the roads 
of the Free State or Transvaal in the rainy season entails suf 
fering on wounded men Under these circumstances we 
must hope that even if the railway lines be broken in some 
places beyond immediate repair means will be found to 
convey at least a light train over the break to the intact 
railway beyond The railway system of the Free State and 
Transvaal are continuous and their permanent way so far 
unimpaired Their gauge is the same as that of Cape Colony 
and Natal All Boer rolling stock will of course be with 
drawn by the Boers as the army advances but if we are once 
able to get some of our own trains on to this system of rail 
ways it will be available for the advance as well as for the 
retirement of sick or wounded 
DIsPosITION OF THE WOUNDED BEYOND RAILHEAD 
Nevertheless all contingencies must be provided for and it 
is quite possible that the advance of the army may have to be 
made for hundreds of miles without the assistance of the rail 
way Putting it at its worst the distance from the southern 
border of the Free State to Pretoria is nearly 4oo miles 
Fortunately the country is magnificently open and level so 
that strategically the difficulties should not be great but the 
march will be a long and arduous one under the most favour 
able circumstances If fighting occurs on the march as we 
must assume that it will there will be three alternatives for the 
woundedthey will either have to advance with the army to 
be sent back to the railhead or to some hospital on the line of 
communications3betweenthearmyandthe railhead In eitherof 
the latter contingencies it is devoutlytobehopedtherewillbe no 
such disaster as occurred at Dundee where our wounded were 
left in the hands of the enemy I do not suggest that the 
enemy did not take care of them and treat them well we are 
assured that they do both I will not venture to criticise the 
tactics which rendered such a step necessary but it cannot be 
ignored that it is a bitter experience for a wounded soldier to 
find himself in such a position nor can it be doubted that if 
such a fate came to be regarded as at all a probable con 
tingency it could have any but a discouraging effect upon our 
men The line of communications will be the greatest diffi 
culty Sir R Buller has to contend with and its special bearing 
upon the disposal of the wounded will no doubt receive his 
careful consideration Among other things recently added to 
the army equipment to be sent out to South Africa are a

J   
number of traction engines and trucks It is highly probable 
that these would be found most serviceable on the plains of 
the high veld 
FOOD SUPPLY 
With reference to the food supply it is certain that a large 
quantity of tinned meat and vegetables will have to be taken 
At the same time there is no reason why fresh meat should 
not be made available for at least an occasional ration 
During a campaign in which the writer served in South 
Africa a troop of cattle was taken with the column wherever 
it moved Over an open country there is not much difficulty 
about this and both meat and milk are thus supplied 
TYPES OF SICKNESS LIKELY TO OCCUR 
To estimate the probable number of the wounded on an 
expedition of this sort is of course beyond our power We 
may reasonably hope looking to the great strength of the 
army now preparing that they will not be great but with 
regard to the sick the case is somewhat different It is 
certain that a large body of men cannot travel over the open 
veld for weeks together without a certain amount of sickness 
arising The climate taken all round is a healthy and 
pleasant one and about as well suited for an openair life as 
any well could be The country to be crossed is high 
Bloemfontein is 4000 feet Johannesburg nearly 6ooo feet 
and Pretoria over 4000 feet above sea level On these high 
plateaux true malaria scarcely ever occurs The two elements 
which may give some trouble at midsummerand Christmas 
is midsummer in South Africaare the sun and the summer 
rains 
Transient attacks of fever will occur in some instances true 
solar fever in others one or other of those fevers which even 
Dr Patrick Manson still describes as the  unclassed fevers  
of the tropics These attacks are usually of quite short dura 
tion and not severe Sharp attacks of diarrhoea and also of 
dysentery will arise though much depends on the water 
supply If water is good and plentiful they will not be 
numerous If drought occursthough this is unlikely on the 
high veld in the summerthe water supply would be indif 
ferent and the health of the army would be in a measure 
affected Take it all round however for my part I would 
rather campaign on the high veld of South Africa than in any 
northern European country including England At these 
high altitudes pneumonia is the most fatal disease the 
mortality being higher from this disease in South Africa than 
in England 
HOT DAYS AND COLD NIGHTS 
The paper recently issued by the War Office showing the 
medical arrangements for the field force on service abroad 
in South Africa and dealing with medical equipment and 
supplies transport sanitation equipment for nursing sisters 
rations and other important matters contains an Appendix 
V headed  Sanitary Notes Natal aind Transvaal Climate 
This document in referring to the temperature states that 
at Maritzburg and Ladysmith the temperature in the summer 
is intense  In Pretoria the variations are not so great the 
maximum in January the hottest month reaching go9 F 
while in the coldest months July and August the temperature 
falls to a minimum of only 300 to 420 F This information 
is not quite accurate During the writers comparatively 
short visits to Pretoria he has known the temperature to be 
980 in the house while the temperature in the shade some 
times exceeds that recorded for Maritzburg namely 1050 
Pretoria is notoriously one of the hottest large towns in South 
Africa and during the coming months it is highly probable 
that in the vicinity of Pretoria a veryhigh degree of heat may 
be anticipated The warning given as to the great variations 
between the day and night temperatures is certainly based on 
accurate observations and is very valuable All troops who 
may have to bivouac in the open as many of our men will be 
called upon to do should be provided with woollen night 
caps The Tam OShanter is an excellent cap in its way for 
this purpose It is certain that one of the essential pre 
cautions necessary for sleeping in the open is the provision of 
adequate covering for the head at night A long woollen cap 
such as is used by sailors on yachts formed a part of the kit 
of the men in a campaign through which I served in 
South Africa Among the precautions required on account of 
cimate waterproof sheets and cloaks as protection against the 
heavy rains are recommended There is nothing more trying 
to troops on the march than having to bivouac or camp at 
night upon damp ground This is a contingency which fre 
quently arises during the heavy summer rains and one of the 
most piactical and simple precautions which can be adopted 
against this evil is the provision of a waterproof sheet say 
6 feet by 3 which the soldier can place on the ground beneath 
him A small sheet of this sort can be if necessary carried 
by mounted infantry and cavalry when away from the main 
column on distant patrols as it goes readily with the blanket 
on the saddle 
HEADGEAR HELMET OR WIDEAWAKE 
Suitable headdress as a protection against the sun is another 
precaution recommended and in reference to that I should 
like to say that while the helmet is a universally approved 
mode of headdress for tropical climates it nevertheless has 
undoubted objections as a headdress for the soldier during a 
campaign It is an impossible thing to liedown in it anditvery 
soon loses its smart appearance further in really gi eat heat 
I quedtion whether the helmet gives such protection from the 
sun as is obtained say from a wideawake hat with a pug 
garree The advantages of the wideawake which is use by 
all Colonial troops are many the men can sleep in it at 
night or during the midday halt can lie down on the ground 
in it For the rough and tumble of camp life it is an infinitely 
more comfortable and more suitable headdress than the 
helmet 
CLOTHING 
A fourth precaution recommended in Appendix V is  warm 
clothing even in summer in the Drakensberg country I 
would point out that the period spent by troops in the 
Drakensberg country is not likely to be at all prolonged nor 
is there any appreciable degree of cold in the summer The 
Drakensberg consists of the somewhat mountainous country 
between Ladysmith and the Transvaal frontier For the 
main column proceeding from the south there will be no 
mountains to be encountered and although I believe serge 
to be a better material than khaki there is no reason to 
suppose that during the summer anything in the shape of 
really thick clothing will be required by the great majority of 
our troops 
ENTERIC FEVER DYSENTERY AND DIARRHCEA 
Reference to the extreme liability of the occurrence of 
enteric fever is made This is one of the scourges of South 
Africa It is common in Johannesburg and along the line of 
mines and will doubtless be liable to arise in any camp 
remaining in the same spot for any length of time It could 
have been wished that the instructions with regard to the 
sanitary precautions necessary against the occurrence ot 
enteric fever had been a little more detailed and explicit 
The one remedy urged appears to be the use of disinfectants 
for which purpose quicklime is strongly recommended but it 
must be pointed out that it may not be possible for armies on 
the march to carry any great quantity of material of this sort 
and that after all there are very few disinfectants which are 
more efficacious than mother earth which will always be 
ready to hand its proper use at the latrines is to my mind 
more important than artificial disinfectants On proper atten 
tion being given to this one particular detail more will depend 
probably than upon anything else The abdominal belt is no 
doubt an admirable precaution against those sudden chills 
which are associated with the onset of dysentery and diarrhoea 
MALARIA HAEMATUTRIA AND PNEUMONIA 
Malarial fevers the Appendix states occur around Delagoa 
Bay and the Limpopo River and disappear in the higher 
plateaux of Northern Natal and Zululand but they are carried 
up some of the valleys  High grounds should therefore be 
selected for camps and valleys avoided As has already been 
pointed out the vast tracts of country which are likely to be 
the scene of our military operations during this warthat is 
the plains of the Free State and the Transvaal and their 
borders to the west and east as well as the whole of the south 
eastern portion of the Transvaalare practically entirely free 
from malaria so that I do not anticipate that this disease will 
occur to any appreciable extent among any of our troops The 
gentle valley or laagte on these high plains is as healthy

and safe as the crests of the rolling undulations Haematuria 
 red water  is referred to among parasitic diseases as com 
mon in the lowlying coast country it is also common I 
may add in the lowlying portions of the Transvaal but 
these as already stated are not likely to be occupied to any 
extent by our soldiers The tributaries of the Croco 
dile River to the immediate north of Johannesburg are 
infested with the bilharzia parasite The reference to pneu 
monia is brief but states that it often occurs in the form of 
epidemics in the Transvaal during the winter months As 
already pointed out the mortality from this disease on the 
highlands of South Africa is high and although it is more 
prevalent in winter than summer it is liable to occur all the 
year round 
DISINFECTION 
A final note in this Appendix commends certain reports 
for the perusal of the medical officers joining the field force 
It also adds that any medical officer considering that in 
order to carry out effectively the measures indicated above 
for the prevention of disease in connection with standing 
camps additional materials such as disinfectants are 
required he should make an immediate demand for them 
If as I have already suggested the medical officer will only 
bear in mind that mother earth is by far the most economical 
and admirable material for his purpose he will be able to 
avoid unnecessary demands for other disinfectants which 
may not be readily obtainable at some odd hundred miles 
from our bases 
THE WAR IN SOUTTH AFRICA 
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRFSPONDENT IN CAPETOWN 
November 1st 
THE CENSORSHIP 
IT is impossible at the present time to send much news with 
reference to the military medical arrangements for the cam 
paign In the first place the dispositions which have eo far 
been made are merely of a temporary nature and will be alto 
gether remodelled as soon as General Buller has matured his 
plans and secondly the censorship is so strict that scarcely 
any information is obtainable as to what has actually been 
done When I tell you that the Berkshire Regiment were at 
Stormberg Junction at least a week before any newspaper in 
Capetown published the informatioin and that only by very 
slow degrees has the news leaked out that a force in full of 
some 2500 men is at another pointDe Aarthe readers 
of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL will understand this 
And as ven Royal Army Medical Corps information may give 
a rough indication as to troops either being at a particular 
place or being likely to be sent there it is except in the 
simplest details invariably refused For this reticence the 
ever present Boer spy must be held responsible Such details 
as are obtainable I will however give 
EXCELLENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY THE ROYAL 
ARMY MEDICAL CORPS 
The arrangements for the war as carried on thus far appear 
to be very complete The Natal force I am assured from 
several trustworthy and independent sources is admirably 
provided from the medical side Colonel Supple the Prin 
cipal Medical Officer took a journey there shortly before war 
broke out and saw to every detail so completely that there 
was practically nothing to do when Sir George White and his 
staff arrived And the arrangements he then made have 
stood the test of practice for the Royal Army Medical Corps 
has proved thoroughly equal to its work at the fairly 
severe engagements that have already occurred Contrary 
to what has sometimes happened nothing has been 
wanting and mirabile dictu matdriel and personnel have so far 
always been at the right place The bearer company work 
was heavy at Elandslaagte owing to the extent of ground 
covered and the intervention of darkness immediately after 
the action but it was extremely well done Men who were 
there write me that the Indian bearers are preferred to their 
white comrades having as one phrases it  the hands of a 
woman and they exhibit an absolute indifference to the 
risks of being under fire It is not contemplated to have a 
base hospital in Natal the present arrangement being that 
base hospital patients will be brought down here by ship and 
taken to Wynberg a fashionable suburb about nine miles 
from this city The barracks there have been entirely 
vacated and converted into a hospital capable of holding 
from 550 to 6oo patients It is with very good reason 
cogisidered that the hot climate of Durban in the summer 
precludes that place from being used as a hospital base At 
present no base hospital except Wynberg has been arranged 
for but it is quite possible that others may be established at 
Port Elizabeth and East London This however depends 
entirely on the lines of advance which Sir Redvers Buller 
may adopt Neither place is an ideal situation for a hospital 
owing to depressing weather in summer whilst the climate of 
Wynberg in fact the whole of the Cape Peninsula is all that 
could be desired 
TRANSPORT OF SICK AND WOUNDED 
There is nothing special to note about the Wynberg Hos 
pital It is fitted up in the ordinary way and is well found 
in every respect Should any considerable column advance 
along the eastern frontier a base hospital in that direction 
might be necessary as the long railway journey would be try 
ing and as neither Port Elizabeth nor East London has a good 
harbour sending men down by sea would involve a good deal 
of trouble and risk 
Durban is only open to this latter objection in a very slight 
degree A consignment of sick is already on its way from 
Natal The ailments are varied but I am told include a 
good many cases of dysentery or dysenteric diarrhcea I 
should mention that the accommodation at Wynberg could be 
easily supplemented by huts if necessary and that there is 
excellent railway communication right from the Capetown 
Docks to the Wynberg Station which is very near the hos 
pital 
THE AMBULANCE TRAINS 
The idea is to make use of the railway line to the utmost 
extent possible and two trains have been already constructed 
at the local works of the Cape Government Railways under 
the supervision of the Principal Medical Officer 1 bad the 
opportunity of inspecting these yesterday and found them 
very complete and well designed Seven vehicles have been 
built with two combined pharmacy and kitchen coaches It 
is intended to run them as two trains usually but 
although there is through communication from car to car each 
is detachable and a train or trains can be made up as desired 
Three of the ambulance vehicles are fitted for 4 officers and 20 
men and four for 4 officers and I2 men Being on a narrow gauge 
line they are of course somewhat deficient in width but 
they are roomy enough for all practical purposes The bunks 
are arranged lengthwise in two tiers the upper furnished 
with weather boards The mattresses are stuffed with horse 
hair and covered with Berkmeyers prepared waterproof can 
vas an excellently cool and cleanable  material Each 
bunk has a handy locker for books glasses and the like The 
four officer bunks are at one end screened off by curtains 
Between these bunks and the rest are the side entrances 
to the vehicles and at this point the uprights sup 
porting the corner bunks can be turned aside on a 
hinge thus allowing of turning a stretcher without 
difficulty There are of course entrances at each 
end of the coaches Each coach contains a couple of 
seats for attendants a set of pigeonholes for dressings or 
bottles and a watercloset The latter discharges direct on to 
the line without any flush of water a somewhat objectionable 
arrangement certain to lead to fouling of the sides of the 
funnel Ventilation is excellent being on the double ridge 
plan the opening being closed by adjustable screw flaps 
The pharmacy waggons contain a very well equipped dis 
pensary with store room a kitchen pantry with refrigerating 
cupboards room for patients clothing with arm racks and 
bunks for six attendants There is also a very handy shower 
bath with dressing room The cars are lighted with oil 
lamps The officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps and 
some others of the personnel will be provided with an ordinary 
saloon carriage The vehicles themselves are calculated to 
accommodate 12 or I5 personnel They are intended to run 
up and down the main line of communication
