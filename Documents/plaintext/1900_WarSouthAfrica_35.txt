THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE MILITARY HOSPITALS IN NATAL 
By Archibald Watson MD FRCSEng 
Professor of Anatomy and Operative Surgery at the Adelaide University 
S Australia  late Consulting Surgeon to the Forces in Natal 
Pieter maritzburg November 10th 
During the time the late Sir William Stokes was in Natal he 
contributed some interesting experiences to your pages re 
garding the hospitals on the lines of communication in Natal 
notably those of Lady smith and Mooi River 
His untimely demise rendered it impossible to place on 
record his impressions of the excellent work done in the 
military hospitals at Pietermaritzburg where the special faci 
lities which he enjoyed as Consulting Surgeon to HM Forces 
enabled him to appreciate at their true value the efforts of 
those who controlled that huge institutionthe Military Hos 
pital at Fort Napier with its 1000 beds and the auxiliary hos 
pitals which were integral parts thereof namely the College 
Hospital with 300 beds the Legislative Assembly Hospital 
with 66 beds and the Municipal Hospital Greys with 50 of 
its beds devoted to military patients 
The General Hospital at Fort Napier is in itself a maze of 
scattered buildings including the garrison church which 
after the battle of Colenso had to be equipped and turned into 
a ward The smaller hospitals above mentioned were all 
about a mile and a half to two miles distant from the 
General Hospital and at opposite points of the town 
and thus it will bejseen that the PMO LieutenantColonel 
P H Johnston RAMC found himself suddenly confronted 
with a most difficult problem at the beginning of hostilities 
but succeeded wi hin a few days in transforming all these 
institutions into hospitals of a very efficient type This feat 
was not accomplished without the able co operation of Majors 
Anthony Dodd and A L F Bate RAMC Divisional 
Officer Last June the former met with an accident through 
his horse falling and was invalided to England to the sincere 
regret of everyone associated with him  his heavy duties as 
Registrar and Secretary then devolved on Major Bate an 
officer whose iron constitution has eaved him throughout his 
career from appearing on the sick list I am indebted to him 
for the following statistics  
The greatest number of sick and wounded under treatment in one day 
after the battle of Colenso was 1348 
The number of patients invalided to England wag 3500 
The number of operations performed was 260 chiefly for gunshot 
wounds and of these a very comprehensive and instructive report 
illustrated by many beautiful x ray photographs has been prepared by 
Dr Irvine Civil Surgeon attached to the KAMC 
The good results obtained by the surgeons apart from their 
personal skill were in great part due to the amazing rapidity 
with which the wounded were transferred to Maritzburg and 
carried from the station to the fort by the use of the McCor 
mackBrook pattern of wheel stretcher which provided it is 
handled as directed by the inventors can scarcely be improved 
upon 
From a civilian point of view the General Hospital Maritz 
burg was all the more difficult to administer as the personnel 
was constantly changing nurses atid doctors coming and 
going nevertheless benefit resulted by thus feeding other 
hospitals nearer the front with medical officers nurses and 
orderlies who during their period of service at Fort Napier 
had become more or less familiar with military discipline and 
the exigencies of military surgery As the campaign drew to 
a close the subsidiary institutions reverted to their 
original purposes The Gem ral Hospital Fort Napier was 
gradually converted into a stationary hospital of 2co beds and 
thebulkof the patients there were trausf erred to Howick where 
the hospital is more modern and more salubriously situated 
than that at Maritzburg from which it is separatedby little 
over an hours ride by rail It is controlled by Major West 
cott PMO and besides the sick from Gfneral Bullers 
forces has latterly received the wounded from General 
Frenchs army outside the bounds of Natal 
General Sir Rdvers Bailer V C etc and Colonel Gallwey 
CB PMO of flatal seeuted the site on which the Howick 
Hospital stands and General Bui 1er naturally takes a pride 
in it Nevertheless when he visid the General Hospital 
Maritzburg for the last timj he pa d the highest tritute in 
his power to LieutenantColonel Armfctrong Acting SMO 
KAMC and Major Bate RAMC in the absence of 
LieutenantColonel Johnston who wss temporarily on the 
sick list as a result of the great strain to which he had been 
subjected during the whole of the previous twelve months 
In conclusion I would like to say that in common with 
Sir William Stokes Sir Thomas Fitzgerald and Professor J 
Chiene late consulting surgeons to HM Forces I fail to see 
that any other system than the one persistently followed by 
the authorities in Maritzburg could have produced similar 
favourable results an opinion which had he lived Sir William 
Stokes would undoubtedly have placed on record 
IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
Mr L Vernon Cargill FRCS who has now returned to 
London after acting as ophthalmic surgeon to the Imperial 
Yeomanry Hospital since its establishment at Dee If ont ein 
sends us some notes which bring the history of the hospital 
down to November ioth shortly before he left 
At that date there were 492 patients in hospital of whom 
nearly fourfifths were Yeomen Most of the cases then being 
received were convalescents and the staff of the hospital at 
Deelfontein had been further reduced by the departure not 
only of Mr Cargill but also of Messrs Christopherson and 
Ashdown for England while Dr Washbourn was engaged 
with the Branch Hospital at Pretoria 
Perforation in Enteric Fever 
Mr Cargill states that three cases of perforation in enteric 
fever had been operated upon but none had recovered The 
following is the report of the last case  
The patient a man aged 30 was under the care of Dr Elliot Perfora 
tion occurred in the fourth week of the disease which was severe and 
marked by much toxaemia Distension was not great At the time of per 
foration the pulse was 96 and the temperature 1012o F There was no fall 
of temperature with the perforation although the pain was sudden and 
severe enough to make the patient call out and to double him up in bed 
During the next few hours the temperature gradually rose to 102 6 Ft 
and the pulse to 1x6 Tenderness and rigidity increased in the lower half 
of the abdomen Mr Ball an ce operated within six hours of the attack of 
pain and found the perforation immediately under the laparotomy 
wound in a coil of the ileum 18 inches from the caecum It was one 
sixteenth of an inch in diameter and there had been very little leakage 
into the abdominal cavity The aperture was closed by eight Halsted silk 
sutures quite half an inch of the wall of the bowel being unfolded on each 
side of it Asa precautionary measure a few stitches were placed in 
another Peyers patch 12 inches from the caecum to unfold its very thin 
base The intestinal coils and Douglass pouch were sponged dry No 
irrigation or drainage was used The patient progressed extremely well 
for the next fortyeight hours the pulse came down to under 90 the 
temperature was subnormal there was no pain and it wag thought that 
he would pull through At the end of this time however he again com 
plained of abdominal pain distension came on rapidly the temperature 
I rose to 1026 F the pulse to 144 and he died fiftysix hours from tne 
time of operation There was no vomiting either at the time of the 
initial perforation or subsequently At the necropsy it was seen that 
another minute perforation had occurred through the base of the same 
ulcer as before along the track of one of the sutures and had caused 
the second attack of peritonitis The whole of the Peyers patch which 
was a very wide one had not been infolded at the operation as too much 
narrowing of the lumen of the bowel was feared There was extensive 
ulcration in the lower 3 feet of the ileum and also in the caecum 
Enteric Fever and Dysentery 
The number of cases ot enteric fever admitted during the 
month preceding the date of the report had increased but the 
general type of disease was less severe than formerly owing 
as was believed to the better condition and therefore greater 
resisting power of the men The frequency of phlebitis in the 
convalescent stage was noticeable and suppurative otitis 
media was also far from uncommon Two cases complicated 
with malaria gave Widals reaction and also showed the ter 
tian parasite in the biood A few cases of acute and many of 
chronic dysentery have been admitted and have done well 
Trial was being made of various native remedies for the treat 
ment of dysentery but the cases so treated had been few in 
number and the results had not been very striking 
Cardiac and Renal Disease 
The number of cases of cardiac and renal disease admitted 
had increased Some of the cardiac cases were instances of 
valvular disease arising during an attack of acute rheumatism 
but the majority were examples of failure of compensation due 
to the strain of hard work and exposure on an already damaged 
heatt To the sime causes the cases of acute kidney aflfV ction

and muscular varieties is still very common It is interest 
ing to note that in the great majority of the former and in 
many of the latter there is a history of previous acute rheu 
matism Acute rheumatism is and has been conspicuous by 
its absence though many patients convalescent from the dis 
ease have been admitted 
Dr Elliot remarks that from what he has seen here he would 
be inclined if examining men for war purposes to reject all 
or nearly all who have passed through an attack of rheumatic 
fever The selection of men for the Yeomanry battalions has 
apparently been made on specially liberal lines Many cases 
of old standing valvular and renal disease have come out and 
one man arrived in hospital with an unhealed nephrotomy 
wound with which he had left home Other cases have come 
under the care of the Ophthalmic Surgeon of Yeomen who 
have been passed and sent out for active service in the field 
the condition of whose eyes and sight should have led to their 
rejection 
ENTERIC FEVER AT MOOI RIVER HOSPITAL 
The following extracts from a letter dated October 24th from 
Major Henry H Johnston RAMC who has been in charge 
of the medical or enteric fever division of Mooi River Hospital 
Natal since January 29th is of interest as showing how the 
risk of infection to the hospital staff and orderlies who are in 
direct attendance upon the enteric fever cases may by the 
exercise of care be kept down to a very low percentage as 
compared with even the surgical division of the same hos 
pital 
In a letter dated September 26th Major Johnston men 
tioned that the percentage of deaths among the enteric fever 
patients in this hospital since it was opened in January had 
been lowered to slightly under the 10 per cent at which it 
stood when we published his letter of August 10th in our 
issue of September 15thnamely 118 deaths out of 1209 
cases exclusive of officers 
The enteric fever disinfection carried out in this hospital since February 
last has been very successful Although 45 per cent of the personnel have 
been employed in the enteric fever wards only about 36 per cent of the 
cases of enteric fever have occurred among them the remaining 74 per 
cent of cases having occurred among the personnel employed in other 
parts of the hospital so that the risk of enteric fever infection among the 
orderie3 employed in the enteric fever wards has always been about half 
of what it was among the orderlies employed in other parts of the hos 
pital Notwithstanding that every precaution was taken to detect cases 
of enteric fever among patients transferred from other hospitals on their 
arrival here so as to ensure their isolation a certain number in the 
early stages of the disease escaped notice and were treated for days or 
weeks in the general wards of the hospital before they were diagnosed 
and transferred to the enteric fever wards in the medical division of the 
hospital Such cases no doubt were sources of infection as adequate pre 
cautions against the spread of infection were not taken 
During an outbreak of enteric fever all excreta should be disinfected 
and incinerated as it is impossible to detect every case of enteric fever in 
its early stages in the general wards of a hospital There has not been a 
single case of enteric fever among the officers and civil surgeons em 
ployed in this hospital but out of about 750 men of other ranks there have 
been 34 cases 9 of which occurred among the orderlies employed in the 
enteric fever wards and 25 among the noncommissioned officers and men 
employed in other parts of the hospital 
Of the above number 3 only have been contracted since June ist and 
1 of these was contracted in the Transvaal when the patient had been 
detached on temporary duty for several weeks 
As regards the 9 cases contracted among orderlies employed in the 
enteric fever wards several were probably due to carelessness on the part 
ot the orderlies some of whom were punished for eating their meals and 
sleeping in vacant beds in the enteric fever wards To lessen these risks 
the orderlies were supplied with improvised hay mattresses in their own 
tents and a hot meal was provided for the night orderlies at 3 am 
The following is the meteorology of Mooi River for September  Mean 
temperature in protected shade 4500 feet above sea level minimum 
453 F maximum 752o F  highest 89o F on 24th lowest 34o F on 9th

THE PRINCESS OF WALES HOSPITAL SHIP 
On December 10th the Princess of Wales visited Southampton 
for the purpose of inspecting the hospital ship named after 
her It had shortly before arrived from South Africa with a 
third draft of ill and wounded soldiers Of the 170 patients 
comprising this draft over 100 were confined to their cots 
when the ship left CspeTown but on arriving at Southampton 
only 9 were bedridden One case however had proved fatal 
and that was the only death which had occurred on board 
while the Princess of Wales had been in use as a hospital 
ship The total number of admissions of sick and wounded 
for treatment had been 728 It is greatly to be hoped that the 
ship the fitting out of which cost at least 8000 will not be 
dismantled but no orders have as yet been received for its 
return to South Africa and the Committee are apprehensive 
that it will be paid off 
THE WELSH HOSPITAL 
At a meeting of the General Committee of the Welsh Hospital 
on December 10th a report on the present position of the hos 
pital and the work it had accomplished was read by Sir David 
Evans Between June 5th and September 24th 757 patients 
had been treated in the hospital most of whom were suffering 
either from enteric fever or gunshot wounds The number of 
fatal cases was only 8 Not a single case of gunshot injury 
needed amputation a result ascribed to the clean perforation 
made by the Mauser bullet and to the use of the telephone 
probe The following resolution was proposed by Sir John 
Williams and seconded by Viscountess Barker President of 
the Ladies Committee  
The Committee of the Welsh Hospital in South Africa desire to record 
their profound sorrow for the death of the originator of the hospital and 
their able and devoted secretary Professor Alfred Hughes who when the 
hospital was in serious difficulties owing to deaths and illness among the 
staff volunteered to go to South Africa to undertake its management and 
while in the discharge of his duties at Pretoria fell a victim to enteric 
fever The Committee feel that no nobler example of selfsacrifice can be 
found in the annals of medicine They would convey to the sorrowing 
widow children and relatives their deepest sympathy and at the same 
time express their highest appreciation of his selfsacrificing services in 
the cause of the sufferers in the war 
THE LANGMAN HOSPITAL 
Twentytwo of the staff and five of the nurses of the 
Langman Hospital accompanying 7 officers and 381 men 
sick and wounded arrived at Plymouth on December 8th 
The medical arrangements on board the transport were in 
charge of the staff of the Langman Hospital Civil Surgeon 
C Gibbs FRCS being the senior officer During the ten 
months the hospital has been in service in South Africa no 
fewer than 1200 patients have been treated of whom over 300 
were surgical and there has not been among them a single 
death 
The St John Ambulance Brigade is despatching 100 more 
hospital orderlies for service in South Africa having received 
a further requisition from the War Office to that effect This 
is in addition to the 68 extra brigade men despatched a fort 
night back at Lord Bobertss request and brings the total of 
its members on active service up to 1739 of which over 60 
have died from enteric fever and other diseases 
LITERARY NOTES 
In referring lately to Dr John Johnstons Musa Medica we 
stated that the book was published by the Savoy Press we 
are informed that this is incorrect It is published by the 
Labour Press Miller Street Manchester 
At a meeting of the New Zealand Branch of the British 
Medical Association some time ago it was decided that the 
New Zealand Medical Journal should be resuscitated The 
first number is now before us and both its contents and

its appearance are highly creditable to the editor Dr 
J Malcolm Wason and his assistants It contains a 
presidential address on colcnial practitioners delivered by 
Dr Walter Thomas at the annual meeting of the New Zealand 
Branch held last February Dr Thomas des not give an
