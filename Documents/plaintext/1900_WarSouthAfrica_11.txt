Nov 17 igoo1 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA AH5 449 
which our brigade was now a part marched from Balmoral 
17 miles distant but we were not destined to reach there 
without mishap The weather had been very threatening all 
day and rain began about 2 pm  about 3 miles on the wrong 
side of Balmoral our own convoy was brought to the halt at a 
drift in which a Cape cart and a 47 gun had stuck  the 
former was however the offender so far as our further pro 
gress was concerned By this time it was pitch dark the 
rain was coming down in a pitiless torrent and the wind was 
icy cold To proceed was impossible and we had to stay here 
the night three miles of convoy in our rear being in the 
same plightno food no shelter Major Hale with character 
istic energy walked on to Balmoral to report and on coming 
back wet through he and I made the best of it in a Cape cart 
which I had fortunately commandeered at Rustfontein 
To describe this night is beyond my powers but when I say 
that we alone lost 12 mules and that I counted 195 dead ani 
mals within quite a short distance some idea may be formed 
of its severity Early in the morning we made ready to pro 
ceed when we heard that an officer of the Argyll and Suther 
land Highlanders had died in the night from exposure we 
sent back a stretcher party and carried the body in with us 
to be buried by the regiment 
We reached Balmoral at 1030 and looked forward toa days 
rest but were doomed to disappointment as orders came at 
11 pm for us to march at 1230 back to Pretoria 
Return to Pretoria 
Many guesses were made as to the reason for the return of 
the division and we thought we were being done out of the 
final advance to Komati Poort and neighbouring district  
but events proved that this was yet far distant important 
work having to be done in the Rustenburg distrist before the 
final advance could be undertaken Our return march was 
uneventful We reached Pretoria on July 30th and the 
division marched past Lord Roberts and a large crowd of 
people at 12 oclock on its way to campt Daaspoort two miles 
to the west of the town We sent all our sick chiefly cases of 
fever and intestinal trouble to the detachment that I found 
had been installed by the principal medical officer in a house 
which they were energetically preparing as a military hos 
pital and was taken over by the RAMC our officers and 
men being lent for use until we should require their services 
in the field Unfortunately our mules had been handed back 
to the transport and hence we could not obtain fresh ani 
mals This day in Pretoria was a very busy one as w were 
under orders to march the next morning 
The March to Rustenburg 
On August ist Mahons brigade marched through Vander 
boom Pass and then westwards on the Rustenburg road 
Pilcher was on our right and the rest of Hamiltons division 
on the left separated from us by the range of hills At 8 am 
fighting began and continued all day our guns dislodging the 
Boers from a kopje at Middlewater where we camped for the 
night Two of our ambulances went out after the fighting and 
brought back five wounded all flesh wounds of the thighs or 
buttocks made as the men were lying down We finished 
dressing these cases by 10 pm and sent one of our ambulance 
waggons with the wounded back to Pretoria the next morning 
The next day we marched forwards heavy firing proceeding 
all day from Hamiltons direction but Mahons brigade did 
not come into action In the evening we camped at Zilikatz 
Nek where the Lincolns had been attacked some time before 
The fighting on this day had been with a commando holding 
this pass and Hamilton had about forty casualties which 
were dealt with by his own field hospitals 
The country we were now in is very pretty certainly the 
garden of the Transvaal  the valley bounded by considerable 
hills on either side is very fertile and studded by prosperous 
farms in many cases well stocked Oranges lemons and 
similar fruits grow in abundance and proved most acceptable 
The want of fresh vegetables and fruit is very severely felt 
after a time and these are eagerly taken when a chance offers 
On August 3rd our march was very short as we had to cross 
the Crocodile River by a bad drift We camped just the other 
side of it opposite Commando Pass but saw nothing of the 
enemy although about twenty prisoners were brought in from 
neighbouriug farms The next day we marched to Sterk 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY FIELD HOSPITAL 
We have received the following further letter from Mr C 
Stonham Chief Surgeon and Officer Commanding Imperial 
Yeomanry Field Hospital  Senior Surgeon Westminster 
Hospital etc  
At Pretoria 
The Devils Kantoor October 6th 
In my letter from Barberton I gave a short outline of our 
marches and work up to our return to Pretoria from Springs 
on July 17th 
We entered Pretoria early in the morning and sending our 
convoy to our old camping ground at Arcadia Major Hill and 
I went to report to the Principal Medical Officer and obtain 
further orders 
it was decided that we should have a detachment of the 
Field Hospital and Bearer Company with some of our trans 
port animals and waggons at Pretoria while the main body 
marched to rejoin General Mahons brigade We accordingly 
left Mr Openshaw and Dr Purves Stewart with 50 men 
5 waggons and the necessary equipment and stores for the 
formation of a rest camp hospital Next morning we marched 
with the remainder and came up with General Mahon in the 
afternoon at KameeFs Drift There had been two days 
fighting here and we did not leave the ridge until July 20th 
on which day we passed Pretoriuss farm and spent nearly all 
day in crossing the Pienaars River  the drift was very steep 
and hence the waggons and especially the heavy guns 
required many teams to drag them over 
 
South African Drifts 
These drifts are passages of the usually rocky beds of 
rivers with at this season of the year comparatively little 
water During the rains there may be as much as 40 feet to 
50 feet of water at the drifts which are consequently rendered 
impassable Many drifts have very steep banks and abomin 
able approaches which when a few waggons have passed are 
often a foot deep in mud and slush In this carts sometimes 
stick and it becomes necessary to employ double or even 
treble spans of mules or oxen to pull them out I need hardly 
say that the passage of such drifts by ambulance waggons 
causes very considerable suffering to sick and wounded men 
and delay to the whole convoy which may extend for many 
miles On some days we have had to pass as many as halfa 
dozen drifts our march being consequently slow and most 
arduous not to mention the wear and tear to transport 
animals 
Ambulance Waggons 
Drifts are a very severe test of the strength and durability 
of a waggon In this respect we certainly have much reason 
to thank the builder of ours  they are most excellent have 
stood wear and tear admirably and I think I may say are the 
best in the country Our ambulance waggons are built dif 
ferently to those in use in the army which only carry two 
patients lying down whereas ours will take four and are much 
lighter 
The March to Balmoral 
On July 2ist at 830 there was heavy firing about 10 miles 
ahead of us and it continued at intervals all day until we 
reached our camp where we found that the Boers had been 
shelling Colonel Hickmans force near a spruit Colonel 
Hickman with 800 men were camped here and the next day 
he transferred our sick to his field hospital which was going 
back to Pretoria 
On July 22nd Mahons brigade joined Ian Hamiltons 
division at Rustfontein where we remained the next day to 
give PoleCarew and Clery time to march up on our right 
flank Just before reaching camp at dusk one of our waggons 
I regret to say came to grief in a hole the native driver 
being killed and the waggon orderly receiving two very severe 
scalp wounds 
On July 24th we camped at Bronkhorst Spruit the enemy 
sniping our rear during the march here We found a large 
forceabout 20000Lords Robert and Kitchener having come 
up in the morning The next day Hamiltons division of

stroom and a runner came in from Baden Powell who was 
hemmed in at Rustenburg bringing a map made by him and 
indicating the various positions occupied by the Boers and 
their numbers When we advanced on August 5th however 
they were not to be found and we reached Rustenburg 
unopposed 
The Actions about Rustenburg 
The country is naturally fortified on this side of Pretoria 
and if the Boers do not defend it it argues most strongly that 
they will not again stand On August 6th Major Hale and I 
marched out with part of our ambulances towards Majata 
Pass where the enemy was said to be in force but we 
returned at night without having seen anything of them 
although heavy gun fire was heard all day some miles distant 
and it was feared the Boers had captured one of our convoys 
coming up from Mafeking The next day we marched back 
a we thought for Pretoria having relieved Rustenburg and 
Baden Powell marching with us We carried in our waggons 
all the sick and wounded who were fit to leave the Rustenburg 
Hospital and supplied the doctor in charge of those who 
could not be moved with medical comforts from our own 
stores On August 9th we passed over Commando Pass 
and camped at Grootplatz from which place we sent a sick 
convoy to Pretoria 
On the nth we again proceeded westwards passing through 
Hekpoort the next day and camping at Thorndale On August 
13th Major Hale and Dr Green with two ambulance waggons 
went on with a flying column under General Watson the rest 
of us following with the remainder of the division We came 
in touch with Kitchener and Methuen on August 15th who 
were pursuing a commando under C de Wet who was making 
for Rustenburg to join Delarey Mahons column came back 
to our camp on this day 
On August 17th having camped the night before 5 miles 
to the westward we moved on to Olifants Nek half a battery 
and some infantry going on ahead with four of our ambulances 
under Major Hale After some shelling the Boers were driven 
from the Nek and we proceeded to Rustenburg From this 
action we had only two wounded The next morning we again 
left Rustenburg and marched towards the Crocodile River 
near which at Zwartkopps Mahons brigade had a two days 
action August 19th and 20th with De Wets commando On 
the first day one of our waggons was taken together with an 
Australian ambulance by the Boers but Major Hale rode 
back and represented the facts to the General who at once 
sent a doctor from one of the Boer ambulances which was in 
our lines and which we had helped with drugs and medical 
comforts to interview the Boer commandant with the result 
that the ambulance came in later in the afternoon and brought 
in some wounded 
On the night of August 20th the Boers vacated their posi 
tion and we went in pursuit as far as Warm Baths but we 
failed to come up with them August 24th 
On August 26th we left for Pretoria where we arrived on 
August 28th to leave again however after one days rest for 
our march to Barberton
