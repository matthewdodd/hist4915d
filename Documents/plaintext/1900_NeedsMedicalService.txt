THE NEEDS OF THE MEDICAL SERVICE OF THE 
ARMY 
As reorganisation and reform in the Army Medical Service 
will probably soon engage the attention of the War Office it 
appears well to offer the following observations and sugges 
tions based on intimate knowledge of the inner life and 
duties of the service as well as on its external relations to 
the medical schools and the profession at large 
The statement represents broadly the wants disabilities 
and drawbacks which still make military service unpopular 
or at least undesirable among young medical men who other 
wise might contemplate an army career 
The following reforms the necessity for which has often 
been stated before may for ready comprehension be again 
recapitulated under a few heads  
IRank and Title 
After prolonged controversy and opposition the late War 
Minister Lord Lansdowne granted to medical officers with 
the happier t results army rank and titles in a R yal corps 
That necessary and legitimate status was at once ungrudgingly 
accepted by the army at large and has undoubtedly much en 
hanced the efficiency of both officers and men in th campaign 
in South Africa All that now seems to be required under this 
head is that the corps be placed precisely on the same footing 
as other corps in the service subject to limitation in com 
mand This can be effected by expunging from the Regula 
tions such obsolete orders as may seem to imply infeiioriry in 
the army status of the medical service  by carry ing out  ffiidal 
procedure as in other branches  as for instance by gazetting 
to staff appointments  conferring local or temporary rank on 
those acting in superior appointments  giving due recogni 
tion in ceremonial functions and a fair share of honours and 
rewards etc 
IIUndermanning 
There need be no hesitation in stating that this notorious 
defect lies at the very root of the continued unpopularity of 
the service in the medical schools through farreaching con 
sequences operating as follows  
a By necessitating sudden and frequent moves from 
station to station causing a feeling of constant apprehension 
and unrest and entailing much personal expenditure and Ions 
b By making ordinary leave most difficult to obtain and 
muchdesired 
 
study leave impossible 
c By causing a serious disproportion between home and 
foreign tours of service whereby the average officer spends 
twothirds or even threefourths of his service abroad mostly 
in tropical climates 
d By rendering ordinary and especially 
 
orderly 
 
duties 
unduly severe and at times excessively harassing 
The evils of an undermanned establishment in peace be 
come much aggravated in time of war Before the Boer war 
with about onethird only of the officers at home all the 
military districts at home were chronically short of their 
regulation complements to the extent of 20 to 50 per cent 
During the war these districtshave been practically denuded 
of officers on the active list and duty has only been carried 
on under difficulties by the employment of retired officers 
and a large number of civilian surgeons which latter having 
necessarily no army status placed the discipline of the hos 
pitals in grave jeopardy 
The total number of medical officers on the active list is at 
present about 900 This may be contrasted with an establish 
ment forty years ago of about 1150  remembering further the 
facts that during these years the strength of the regular army 
has been increased at least 25 per cent  while the militia 
which then had a medical service of its own has now prac 
tically none and is entirely dependent on the attenuated 
regular medical service 
The present medical establishments both in officers and 
men are notoriously inadequate for the efficient carrying our 
of peace duties and cannot provide for the mobilisation of 
one army corps without dislocating the duties at home sus 
pending foreign reliefs and absorbing all margin for waste or 
casualties The chief part of the foreign service of medical 
officers is naturally passed in India where over 300 are con 
stantly employed with British troops  but service in India 
would really be popular if the Government of that country 
acted with fairness and liberality which unfortunately ifc 
does not as will be mentioned under the head of pay But 
the wants of India are indeed intimately bound up with 
undermanning of the Royal Army Medical Corps for the inter 
dependence between the latter and the Indian Medical Ser 
vice steadily grows greater in proportion as India becomes  
base in Eastern wars as exemplified in the present China ex 
pedition It may be mentioned that through that expedition 
the Indian Medical Service in both its civil and military 
branches is at present seriously embarrassed Such facts 
must not be lost sight of in any augmentation of the medicaB 
services 
IIIPay 
It cannot be doubted that the pay of the junior ranks of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps is inadequate both at home and 
in India whether it be viewed in relation to inevitable ex 
penses or to the scale of remuneration which young medical 
men can command in civil life 
The element of supply and demand must be kept in view 
and it must be remembered that the army as a career for 
young medical men has to compete at once with a more 
liberally endowed Indian Service a relatively better paid 
Naval Service and recently increased remuneration in civil 
life Since the abolition and prohibition of unqualfied assist 
antships in civil life qualified juniors receive salaries as 
assistants or locum tenens from 25 to 100 per cent greater than 
they did a few years ago 
The feeling among young medical men on the question of 
army pay may be stated as follows They reason that bring 
ing as they doto the service of the State a lengthened com 
plete and expensive professional education the most expen 
sive and exacting as recently shown of all the learned 
professions they have a right in such employment to py 
which shall from the first enable them to live in reasonable 
comfort  but this is impossible without private means 
whether at home or in India 
Inadequate pay presses on juniors quite as much or more in 
India than elsewhere a fact the more damaging to the popu 
larity of the Army Medical Service inasmuch as the greafc 
majority of junior medical officers spend a large portion of 
their first years of service in that country they are handed 
over to the Government of India about their second year and 
cannot help themselves 
The attitude of the Government of India for many year 
towards the financial aspects of successive medical Royal 
Warrants has been most shortlighted and regrettable Ifc 
seems hardly creditable that the automatic increase of 
medical pay under the rank of major in India is still based 
on a warrant long obsolete and on a scale fixed nearly forty 
years ago  A result is that a lieutenant of the Royal Army 
Medical Corps who becomes a captain after three years doe 
not get the pay of his rank until he has completed five or six 
years service Again when the important semiadministrative 
tank of brigidesurgeon was created with increased pay by 
the Royal Warrant of 1879 its financial consequences were 
long absolutely igoored in India with the result that not a 
few of the rank retired early rather than serve in a false and 
unrequited position 
Certain limited concessions in the pay of medical officers in 
India have indeed of late years been made but chiefly in 
connection with the depreciated rupee and certainly not 
sufficient to invalidate the broad statement that the financial 
provisions of several Ryal Warrants have not been given 
effect in India The ffilare to do so has no doubt deterred 
medical candidates from the army who justly reason that as 
such service would entail many years in India they had 
better spend it in the higher paid Indian Medical Service 
IVOrganic and Administrative Reform 
Such reforms must be initiated on the responsibility of the 
War Office  but the salient points requiring attention are as  
follows  
1 The active list of the officers and men of the Royal Army 
Medical Corps should be increased sufficiently to meet a the 
ordinary peace duties connected with the regular army and 
militia at home and abroad  b to be of a strength always 
available at home to meet the sudden mobilisation of two 
army corps for service abroad without at the same time

wholly denuding the home establishment and altogether 
paralysing foreign reliefs 
2 A trained and really available reserve of officers men 
and female nurses should be formed which will no doubt prove 
a difficult matter 
3 Due reserves of hospital equipment and stores must be 
kept up  these were officially declared to be very deficient at 
the beginning of the war 
4 Pay must be increased and readjusted especially in the 
junior ranks both at home in the Colonies and in 
India 
5 Larger autonomy should be conceded to hospital trans 
port in the field and fuller powers given to medical 
officers to acquire hospital equipments and supplies in emer 
gency 
6 The SurgeonGeneral of an army in the field should be on 
the staff of the General Officer Commanding in Chief always 
in close and direct communication with him instead of on 
the line of communications 
7 Medical officers acting in superior appointments should 
foe gazetted to a step in local or temporary rank as in other 
branches of the service 
GERMN MALARIA EXPEDITION 
Professor Robert Koch head of the German Malaria Expe 
dition has sent a sixth and final report of his investigations 
to the Colonial Department of the German Foreign Office 
The following is a translation of the report which is published 
in the Deutsche medicinishe Wochenschrift of November 15th1  
We started on our homeward journey from Herbertshhe on 
August 6th The line of steamers newly established by the 
North German Lloyd which go from Sydney by New Guinea 
to Hong Kong calling at the Caroline and Marianne Islands 
offered the opportunity of investigating those islands and as 
far as the short stay admitted of taking a glance at their 
anitary conditions Mainly on this ground I chose this line 
for the home journey and I was able on August 12th and 13th 
at Ponape and on the 17th at Saipan to make researches in 
which I was assisted by the Government Medical Officer Dr 
Girschner 
No Malaria in Caroline or Marianne Islands 
At Ponape not only at the seat of Government Colonia 
but in six other places situated at some distance in all 79 
children were examined for malaria In no single one were 
the characteristic marks of malariaenlarged spleen and the 
presence of malaria parasites in the bloodobserved This 
leads me to conclude with certainty that this island is free 
from malaria It is said that for a long time only one case of 
dysentery had occurred According to the statements of Dr 
Girschner the skin diseases so extraordinarily widespread in 
the South Sea and framb sia which is frequently con 
founded with syphilis seem to play no great part on this 
island 
At Saipan among 24 children examined there were likewise 
neither swollen spleens nor malaria parasites Therefore this 
island too is free from malaria 
Framb sia in the South Sea 
Among the many persons pointed out to me as suffering 
from syphilis lupus and leprosy there were none suffering 
from any of these diseases What was mistaken for them 
was framb sia a disease which appears to be very common 
at Saipan This malady called by the English yaws is extra 
ordinarily widespread in the South Sea In the Bismarck 
Archipelago I have seen places in which almost all the 
the children were affected therewith Even the children of 
Europeans occasionally suffer from it Very often framb sia 
is mistaken by laymen and even by medical practitioners 
for syphilis and I feel warranted in assuming that the 
statements as to the great diffusion of syphilis in the South 
Sea and particularly in the German colonial region are based 
on the confusion of syphilis with framb sia It is much to 
be wished that a medical man thoroughly conversant with 
syphilis and skin diseasesif possible a specialistshould 
be sent out to Dutch New Guinea in order to make a closer 
investigation of the relations of these diseases and the skin 
affections which are so extraordinarily frequent in the South 
Sea 
Peculiar Disease at Saipan 
At Saipan there also occurs a peculiar disease which in its 
course and symptomsfever and lasting paralysis of indi 
vidual limbsis suggestive of beriberi Of cases of this kind 
brought to me one was the subject of hemiplegia others of 
articular and muscular rheumatism There was not a single 
case of beriberi among them 
On the whole I got the impression that the health condi 
tions of Ponape and Saipan are very good inasmuch as there 
is no malaria in these islands and except for framb sia they 
appear to be free from other tropical diseases 
Malaria in Egypt 
From Hong Kong we proceeded by the main line of North 
German Lloyd steamers to Suez where the journey was 
broken by a short stay in Egypt 
Our investigations in Egypt were directed to the clear 
ing up of the contradictory statements respecting malaria 
in that country This object has been so far attained 
that in Alexandria several cases of malaria which undoubtedly 
originated in that city or its vicinity were found and genuine 
foci of endemic malaria were discovered in Helouan near Cairo 
and at Wadi Natrum west of the Nile Delta in the middle 
of the desert 
Stephansort 
According to the latest news which reached me from 
Stephansort coming down to August 8th the favourable 
conditions in regard to malaria described in my previous re 
ports remain unchanged 
Maliria Practically Extinct in Germany 
In order to arrange for a repetition in Germany of 
this New Guinea research which has proved so fruitful 
of result Professor Frosch a former member of the 
malaria expedition has at my suggestion visited many parts 
of North Germany which appeared suitable for the purpose and 
made inquiries as to the presence of malaria It has thus 
been shown that malaria everywhere is rapidly dying out In 
many places previously known as foci of malaria the disease 
has wellnigh disappeared In others as for example in the 
marsh lands on the North Sea Coast it occurs only in isolated 
cases but nowhere could there be found a focus of malaria 
suitable for my purpose 
End op the Expedition 
Under these circumstances there remains nothing else tobe 
done but for the present to bring the malaria expedition to an 
end

PROFESSOR CALMETTE ON THE PLAGUE 
The last of the three Harben Lectures on bubonic plague was 
given on November 21st at the Examination Hail of the Royal 
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons by Professor Calmette 
j Director of the Pasteur Institute of Lille 
In this concluding lecture of the series Professor Calmette 
I discussed the defensive measures that should be taken for 
protection against plague commented on the subject of vac 
cination in connection with the disease and detailed the 
conclusions he had arrived at concerning individual and 
general prophylaxis In his opinion it was incontestable that 
vaccination by heated cultures was capable of rendering great 
defensive service in times of epidemic In the hope of eluci 
dating the principal points urged against preceding methods 
of vaccination he had studied the question last year In the 
preparation of his vaccine cultures Professor Calmette em 
ployed a plague virus which originated in Oporto and 
had never passed through any kind of animal The 
cultures were placed on gelose in large flat bottles in which 
after 48 hours there was an enormous microbio development  
20 ccm of sterilised water was then added the culture was 
scraped and the emulsion obtained was poured upon a fine 
linen filter to separate out the fragments of glose carried 
away The filtrate was then poured on a paper filter and the 
microbes left thereon were washed to clear them of adherent 
I toxin They were then heated in a small quantity of water for
