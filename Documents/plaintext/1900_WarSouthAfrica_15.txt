name was compared with the two tables and the issue fatal 
or otherwise thus prophesied Again another astrologer had 
connected the various parts of the body with the different 
stars and planets  thus the sun stood for the right eye the 
moon for the left and the star under which a child was born 
determined the part of the body which would eventually 
suffer When ultimately these doctrines were put to the 
test by an unbelieving public a writer went so far as to add 
a chapter as to how to overcome misrepresentations and doubts 
on the part of patients 
Prosthetic Apparatus after Excision of Lower Jaw 
In the Dental Section Dr Witzel Dortmund showed a 
patient a child in whom he had resected the whole of the 
lower jaw In this case an artificial jaw was inserted imme 
diately and became fixed in its position and to a certain 
extent performed the work of the natural jaw 
Epidemic Dysentery and the Dysentery Bacillus 
Professor W Kruse Bonn stated that dysentery so far as 
Germany was concerned dated from the war of 1870 Some 
30000 soldiers were then affected 3000 dying The returning 
troops spread the disease throughout the country and since 
then it had not disappeared Various local epidemics were 
described which in different localities had in one year caused 
the deaths of 100 to 150 persons During recent years the 
disease had shown itself in a larger number of areas which 
caused the Government to commission the speaker who had 
eight years experience in Egypt to study the disease at 
home Last July he had occasion to witness an epidemic and 
perform eight postmortem examinations on victims of ithe 
disease In the case of Egyptian dysentery Kruse estab 
lished the existence of a certain amoeba which however he 
only once discovered in the above cases On the other hand 
from the faeces he had obtained a bacillus resembling closely the 
typhoid bacillus Inoculation of animals which readily suffered 
from dysenterycats and monkeysgave no results The 
Egyptian bacillus was found in small intestinal ulcers but 
his recent cases showed a membranous formation These 
indications were given as an incentive to further research in 
this direction 
Pathological Changes in Bile 
Dr Brauer Heidelberg stated that former knowledge of 
bile was based entirely upon postmortem examinations On 
the other hand observers could now by means of fistulae make 
comparative investigations some of which as for instance 
those with phosphorus were fairly wellknown He had 
never found sugar in the bile of healthy individuals but 
it was discovered in cases of diabetes diseases of the pan 
creas and after its removal In cases in which parenchyma 
tous changes of liver tissue took place these products had 
been traced in the bile Thus in cases of alcohol poisoning 
alcohol acted detrimentally on the liver substance and the 
bile showed epithelial cells 
Antidotes 
Dr J F Heymans Ghent said that an antidote should not 
only arrest the action of a poison but also arrest and reduce 
the symptoms of poisoning He then proceeded to give some 
examples such as the administration of oxyhydrate of iron in 
cases of arsenic poisoning In this case only the poison re 
maining in the stomach was affected Again an antitoxin had 
no effect on the toxins circulating in the blood but only pro 
tected the cells from the further injurious effect of such poieons 
and therefore was only preventive As a more striking in 
stance he described the result of poisoning by potassium 
cyanide in an organism previously saturated with sodium 
hypophosphite As no effect was produced it might be assumed 
that a certain amount of free CN which was circulating 
might change to CNS which was far less harmful in the 
case of the rabbit for instance 100 times less poisonous 
Conclusion 
Hamburg has been chosen as the next meeting place of the 
Congress and officers were elected for the various sections 
As previously stated some hundred papers were down for 
reading and it would be impossible in a small space to even 
give the names of those that have not been referred to Every 
section however was full of interest and a specialist would 
have heard a large variety of subjects discussed in his respec 
tive department that of obstetrics and gynaecology for in 
stance being particularly well supported by eighteen speakers 
with original papers The Congress passed off very well and 
seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed by those present 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE IRISH HOSPITAL AT PRETORIA 
By Sir William Thomson 
SurgeoninChief 
Pretoria September 18th 
Dr Colemans Services in the Actions outside Pretoria 
I have just seen in print the notes which I sent you late in 
June from this place They were written under great pres 
sure and were unrevised I am aorry to see that I have made 
one important omission In describing our work in the action 
outside Pretoria I have failed to mention the services of my 
colleague Dr Coleman My staff had been so depleted by 
illness that I was able to send only Dr Coleman and a few 
orderlies with the stretchers and ambulances That duty he 
did every day when fighting was expected and when our 
division was actually engaged he was always well to the front 
with his men fearlessly doing whatever the circumstances of 
the moment demanded My bearerssome constabulary and 
some civilianbehaved also with great coolness and bravery 
and I had to use threats to only one Cape boy driver who 
pleaded that he did not come out to be shot 
Results of Three Months Work 
Since I wrote to you last the Irish Hospital has completed 
nearly three months work in Pretoria and I am able to give 
you some figures as to the results Up to August 31st we had 
admitted 1593 patients of whom 445 were enteric cases of 
these last 52 died showing a mortality of 116 Deaths from 
wounds were 84 and from other conditions 091 At Bloem 
fontein where a section of the hospital remained under Dr 
George Stokers charge until June 22nd 150 enteric cases were 
treated with a mortality of 126 Deaths from wounds were 
j 5 per cent and there were no deaths from other causes The 
total number treated in the stationary hospitals which there 
fore does not include fieldhospital work at Prieska or on the 
advance to Pretoria was 1864 with a general deathrate of 
48 It is right to state that 6 enteric cases died within 48 
hours of admission and 4 within 72 hours  these were in the 
last stages of exhaustion but they are of course included in 
the figures given Up to September 13th the admissions to 
the Irish Hospital in Pretoria were 1813 1313 were dis 
charged 70 had died and 430 patients remained under treat 
ment 
In his evidence before the Commission at Bloemfontein the 
Principal Medical Officer General Wilson gave the following 
particulars as published in the repoi t 
The deathrate of wounded at the Irish Hospital was 73 per cent 
whereas at the Liangman it was 715  at No 5 Stationary Hospital 698  and 
at No 9 General Hospital 494 whereas at the Portland it was 733 The 
enteric deathrate was  At the Irish Hospital 1316 percent at No s 
Stationary 1519  and at No 9 General 1405  whereas it was at the Lang 
man 1878 percent andat the Portland 1407 
The Volks Hospital Bloemfontein 
I have just seen the report of the Volks Hospital at Bloem 
fontein ranging from January ist to August 31st The sum 
mary is interesting  
Died from enteric fever 39  died from other causes 4  total 43 
Rate of mortalityThe deathrate on 1004 cases is 43 per cent  the 
deathrate on 462 enteric fever cases is 85 per cent 
Of the 1004 cases were  Civilians mostly Boers 493  military 511 
Amongst the 511 military patients were  392 privates 41 corporals 24 
sergeants 1 sergeantmajor 1 quartermaster 28 lieutenants 7 captains 
3 majors 1 general 3 war correspondents 1 war artist 3 clergymen 6 
medical officers 
The different diseases of which the 511 military were suffering were  311 
enteric fever 166 shotwouDds 4 pneumonia 3 asthma 6 bronchitis 2 
phthisis 1 Brights disease 15 dysentery 3 sud stroke 
Of the 51z military patients 24 died giving a deathrate of 47 per cent 
Of the 311 military enteric patients 24 died giving a deathrate of 775 
per cent

The low deathrate in enteric fever in the Boer Hospita 
will at once be noted and it may serve to justify that ridiculou

Statement of some local nurse which has been published in 
England that she 
 
would be ashamed to lose a case of 
enteric That kind of wild statement carries its own contra 
diction But the return shows once more how fallacious sta 
tistical results may be and what a false impression they may 
convey I have learned that all febrile conditions which can 
not be otherwise classified are put down as enteric At all 
events in the detailed lists which are before me only one 
fever rheumatic other than enteric is noted On the other 
hand tne Army Medical Department have a class for simple 
continued fever It will be seen at once how the inclusion in 
one set of figures diminishes the apparent deathrate and 
how in the case of the army returns the grouping of fevers 
increases the apparent deathrate of enteric There is un 
doubtedly a form of fever which whether it is essentially 
enteric or not has not any of the characteristic symptoms of 
that disease It is obvious that the only way of arriving at 
a result such as that now published from Bloemfontein would 
be to include all febrile conditions under one heading Of 
course it would be unscientific but it would be a result 
arrived at from similar premisses 
Although this hospital happens to stand first on the results 
I think the returns given by the principal medical officer are 
distinctly satisfactory everywhere when the conditions pre 
vailing in a campaign are considered and they will compare 
favourably with those which are obtained in the best hos 
pitals at home 
Prospects for Spring and Summer 
The decrease of enteric cases goes on and we now get down 
to about one fifth instead of onehalf of our admissions The 
deathrate too is steadily falling But we are now in the 
springtime already the temperature is distinctly warm 
Pretoria looks at its best for the young grass is brightening 
the veld and various blooms and the tender green of expand 
ing leaves make softness and brightness everywhere But 
alas we have yet to face dust storms then rains then myriads 
of flies which already are beginning to infest our rooms  and 
to make things worse local authorities assure us that we shall 
have a second outbreak of enteric The season for malaria 
too is just opening along the line of railway to Koomati and 
there will be an increased death roll Hospitals are being 
instituted at Middleberg and other places east of this 
Hospital Accommodation at Pretoria 
In Pretoria itself there is at least at present as much ac 
commodation as is required No 2 General under Colonel 
Keogh the Langman under Mr Gibbs the Imperial 
Yeomanry under Dr Sandwith  the Welsh Hospital under 
Professor Hughes and Nos 1 2 and 3 at the State Model 
School under Major Cummins and other officers of the 
RAMC are now well equipped and at work The No 2 
General Hospital the Langman and the Welsh are grouped 
on the veld two miles out overlooking the town They have 
been well fitted tents and streets are lighted by electricity 
and all the essentialsgood beds and good kitchensare 
present The Yeomanry Hospital occupies a private house 
with some 40 beds and these are supplemented by numerous 
marquees which accommodate 200 patients There is of 
course in all these cases plenty of room for rapid expansion 
and therefore I think we are not likely to have the experiences 
of Bloemfontein repeated here 
The Hospitals Commission 
The Royal Commission to inquire into the charges concern 
ing the hospitals in South Africa arrived here from Bloemfon 
tein on September 8th and forthwith proceeded to take 
evidence On September 10th and 1 ith they spent some 
hours in visiting the hospitals and inspecting the wards 
What impression these made upon their minds I cannot say 
but I do not think the most fastidious critic could find any 
indication of inhumanity in the treatment of the patients in 
Pretoria Every consideration is given to them and I am on 
the other hand able to say that there are no better or braver 
patients than our soldiers It is a pleasure to treat them 
they are so docile and grateful I am sure that is the impres 
sion that 
 
Tommy 
 
has made upon the civilian doctors at all 
events and if he has been hardly treated now and again it 
has been for reasons that were overmastering I 
THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL RED CROSS 
HOSPITAL 
By Henry E Clark FFPSG 
Surgeon in Charge  Professor of Surgery St MuDgos College Glasgow 
Kroonstadt ORC Sept Uth 1900 
The Temporary Hospitals at Kroonstad 
This hospital has been settled at Kroonstadt since the end of 
May The first detachment consisting of the staff and 
equipment for 100 beds reached Capetown on May 12th the 
date of Lord Robertss entry into Kroonstadt and this cir 
cumstance determined our destination I was myself sent 
forward by the night mail on May 15th with four doctors and 
seven nurses the condition of matters at Kroonstadt being 
urgent but the railway line was so seriously damaged beyond 
Bloemfontein that we were detained at that town five days 
During that time the rest of the staff and the equipment went 
round to Port Elizabeth disembarked and actually reached 
the capital of the Free State on the day we left it to go on 
My party reached Kroonstadt on the morning of May 25th the 
only change in our arrangements made at Bloemfontein being 
that six studentorderlies of the Scottish Hospital staff and 
the nurses of No 3 General Hospital were sent on the 
Scottish nurses being put on duty at the Bloemfontein hos 
pitals I shall never forget the scene presented by the tem 
porary hospitals at Kroonstadt when we arrived There were 
about 600 patients in the town nearly all suffering from 
enteric fever These occupied the Dutch Reformed Church 
numerous bell tents in the compound round it the Town Hall 
the Grand Hotel and the Kroonstadt Hotel 
The schools were used as a hospital before the arrival of the 
British and continued to be so used being worked by a 
RussianDutch ambulance The patients in these buildings 
lay for the most part on the floor Some had mattresses but 
many had none and they were thickly crowded together clad 
in their ordinary garments and wrapped in their own 
blankets Until we arrived there were no nurses excepting at 
the RussianDutch ambulance and but few orderlies There 
were 7 medical attendants including 2 Russian surgeons and 
a local doctor  but there was a deplorable lack of medicines 
medical comforts bedclothing and personal clothing for the 
patients I recognise that these conditions were unavoidable 
and have nothing but praise for the admirable work 
accomplished by Major Ford and his stafi under peculiarly 
trying circumstances I agreed to take chargeof the Kroonstadt 
Hotel Temporary Hospital and continued to have charge of it 
till it was vacated Although I had come out with the idea of 
doing surgery I could not refuse to take my share in the treat 
ment of enteric fever patients seeing that the conditions were 
such as I have described o 3 General Hospital and the 
equipment and the rest of the staff of the Scottish Hospital 
reached here two days later May 27th and from henceforth the 
condition of matters speedily improved In a marvellously 
short time the temporary hospitals were put in a satisfactory 
condition and the tent hospitals were soon able to take in all 
the new cases of disease and injury 
The Completion of the Scottish National Red Cross 
Hospital 
A month after the sending off from Glasgow the first de 
tachment consisting of 100 beds a second section consisting 
of the staff and equipment for 210 beds was forwarded and 
still a month later a third section of 210 beds to make up the 
full complement of 520 beds for a general hospital Thus 
our hospital has become the largest voluntary hospital sent 
out with the exception of the Yeomanry Hospital During 
our short stay at Bloemfontein we had visited the hospitals 
and had marked the prevalence of enteric and were not sur 
prised to find a like condition of matters at Kroonstadt 
Bullet and Shell Wounds 
Our dreams of interesting surgical cases and valuable ex 
perience of bullet and shell wounds seemed likely to be 
dissip ited but thanks to the energy of Christian de Wet we 
got a fair share of bullet wounds from Rhenoster Lindley 
Bethlehem and the east country generally Many of these 
exemplified the comparative innocuousness of the Mauser 
bullet so often referred to by your correspondents Thus we 
had cases of bullets passing through the lungs the liver the
