THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE RETREAT FROM SPEARMANS HILL TO 
CHIEVELEY 
By Frederick Trves FRCS 
Consulting Surgeon with the Forces 
Chieveley Camp by Colenso February 23rd 1900 
Septic Infection of Shell Wounds 
As I mentioned in my last letter we had great trouble at 
Spearmans Camp with the number of shell wounds They 
suppurated without exception and a few secondary 
amputations became necessary Moreover the septic 
changes were apt to spread to simpler wounds which 
would under ordinary conditions have healed without 
trouble We had ico coolie attendants with the hospital 
It was their duty to keep the camp clean to take away 
and bury all soiled dressings and to empty vessels contain 
ing discharges etc This work was well done but the 
difficulties of keeping a field hospital free from septic 
influences were increased by the great heat and the plague 
of flies Had we remained at Spearmans it would no 
doubt have been necessary to have changed the pitch of 
the camp The latrine arrangements were on the earth 
closet system with protected buckets and were quite 
perfect 
Retirement of Army 
On February 8 th the army began to retire and we were 
ordered to move all our wounded at daybreak on February 
9th We had then about 150 cases in the hospital and all 
of them would be described as serious Indeed they were 
cases whose removal to the base had been delayed as long 
as possible All these patients had to travel a distance of 1 
twentyfive miles in hot and dusty weather across the 
veld and along roads that could only be described as com 
paratively fair 
Hand Transport of Serious Cases 
It was here again that the value of the excellent system 
of stretcher bearers introduced by Colonel Gallwey PMO 
came so prominently forward The wounded were got 
ready before daybreak and at sunrise every man was on a 
stretcher and the army of stretcher bearers was at hand 
The whole of the 150 were carried by hand on stretchers 
from Spearmans to Frre a distance of twentyfive miles 
Each stretcher had a hood to protect the patient from the 
sun Food and drink and other necessaries were taken 
and the convoy was attended by a surgeon on horseback 
No more perfect way of carrying the wounded exists and 
we were pleased to hear that they all reached Frere with 
out mishap although one poor fellowwhose case was 
hopelessdied as soon as Frere was entered This is I 
think a triumph and the achievement would appeal to 
any who know what roads across the veld are like At 
Springfield the bearers had to ford a river which enters 
the Little Tugela Had the transport been made by 
ambulance waggons I am sure that both lives and limbs 
would have been lost and a terrible amount of suffering 
would have been occasioned An ambulance waggon is 
built to stand very rough work and any kind of road and 
ia at best a very uncomfortable vehicle for a long journey 
Some of the Cases Transported 
Among the patients who were carried down on the 9th 
were several cases of interest On February 3rd I had 
removed the 
 
forequarter 
 
clavicle scapula and upper 
limb for severe gunshot injury of the humrus and 
scapula I employed Paul Bergers method This man 
was among those who travelled to Frere and I am glad to 
hear that he had a comfortable journey and has since done 
very well 
On February 7th at 11 am I performed laparatomy for 
a gunshot wound of the abdomen involving the sigmoid 
flexure No drain was employed but the abdomen was 
well washed out This man undertook this journey of 
twentyfive miles across country on the morning of 
February 9ththat is within fortyeight hours of the 
operation He not only reached Frere with comfort but has 
since done well In civil practice it would be a little novel 
to let a patient take a long journey on the second day after 
a laparotomy 
General Woodgate whose case is assuming a little more 
favourable aspect and who was more at ease after I 
removed the damaged eye was among those who travelled 
down on the 9th He was accompanied by his brother 
who has nursed him with the utmost devotion since the 
day he was wounded 
The Return March of the Hospital 
As soon as one field hospital was empty we began our 
march to Chieveley with as before seventeen oxen waggons 
We reached Springfield at sundown and there bivouacked 
the nurses sleeping in ambulance wagons We left at 
dawn and bivouacked for the next night at Frere On 
February nth we reached Chieveley and enjoyed the 
luxury of once more having tents over our heads These 
marches were very tedious and trying owing largely to the 
freat 
heat the blinding sun and the dust Our stay at 
pearmans Camp had extended to 3 weeks and we had 
dealt withover 1000 one thousand wounded during that 
period 
The Sound of an Approaching Shell 
Before leaving Spearmans I had an experience of a shell 
which enabled me to appreciate the very marked dislike 
Tommy Atkins has to the sound of an approaching shell I 
and Captain Begbie RAMC had ridden out to visit one 
of the advanced field hospitalshospitals whose officers 
have the heaviest duties the greatest share of hardships 
I and I am afraid the least eredit for their splendid work 
This particular hospital had been shelled and had just 
come in to what they hoped was a more sheltered position 
under Zwarts Kop After a chat we left the hospital 
clambered through a donga and rode across a level green 
to the road As we reached the road we heard the exceed 
ingly unpleasant sound of an approaching shell from the 
Boers big gun This shell dropped on the green we had 
just cantered across and some 250 yards from where we 
had pulled up our horses The shell in question was un 
pleasantly near the hospital and a second shell that burst 
shortly after was nearer still and I am afraid our already 
tried friends had once more to move There is no doubt 
that the Boer fire was directed at some waggons and not 
actually at the hospital itself 
Three Months Campaigning 
I and my remaining nurse Miss McCaul have now been 
nearly three months at the front during which time we 
have been under canvas with the same field hospital We 
have moved as the headquarters camp has moved and 
have pitched our camp no fewer than six times namely 
twice at Frere twice at Chieveley once at Springfield and 
once at Spearmans As a comment 
upon 
the effect of 
camp life I may say that when we started at Frere at the 
beginning of December the personnel of the hospital con 
sisted of six individualsthree officers of the RAMC my 
two nurses and myself Out of the sis five of us have been 
laid up with dysentery Miss McCaul being the sole indi 
vidual to escape Of the five who were sick two only the 
commanding officer and myself managed to get well in 
camp The remaining three were seriously ill and were 
gradually removed to the base It thus happens that of 
the six who started only three are still with the hospital 
The hospital has since we started increased in size and the 
staff more than doubled by the appointment of a number of 
civil surgeons and of Netley sisters

The Consulting Surgeons and the RAMC 
I shall leave the hospital when the campaign ends with 
great regret Major Kirkpatrick has proved himself to be 
an ideal commanding officer He has shown us all the 
greatest kindness and consideration and has spared no 
pains to make No 4 the smartest and best hospital in 
the field We have borne the brunt of every engagement 
and the hospital has never failed My other colleagues 
the civil Burgeons were not only the most agreeable of 
companions but they were so keen and so efficient in their 
work that it was the greatest pleasure to cooperate with 
them Those who prophesied that all sorts of trouble and 
disagreement would arise between the army surgeons and 
the civil surgeons should know that no more harmonious 
body of men ever worked together than did those who 
constituted the star of  No 4 Miss McCaul and the 
Netley sisters worked without ceasing and many and 
many a wounded soldier will have reason never to forget 
the unstinted kindness and devotion of the sisters at 
No 4 
The Girl He left behind Him 
In conclusion I am reminded of one little incident which 
may interest those who are interested in the Absent 
Minded Beggar Among the wounded brought in one 
day from Potgieters Drift was a man of scanty clothing 
who held something in his closed hand He had kept 
this treasure in his hand for some eight hours He showed 
it to the sister It was a ring In explanation he said 
 
My 
girl gave me this ring and when I was hit I made up my 
mind the Boers should never get it so I have kept it in 
my hand ready to swallow it if I was taken before our 
stretchers could reach me 
THE BOER AMBULANCE SYSTEM 
From our Special Correspondent in Capetown 
February 28th 1900 
The Hospital at Jacobsdal 
I am indebted to Dr T G Hall a graduate of the University 
of Durham who has been for some time District Surgeon of 
Jacobsdal for some interesting particulars about the Boer 
system of attendance on the wounded at that place which 
was the principal medical base for Cronjes force whilst 
barring the road to Kimberley 
At the outset of the war Dr Hall who I may mention is 
not a Free State burgher was appointed to work at this hos 
pital Jacobsdal is about a dozen miles from Modder River 
about twenty from Magersfontein about twentyfive from 
Gra8pan and about forty from Belmont The original hos 
pital there was the schoolhouse It consisted of three wards 
having about fifteen beds each an operating reception and 
administration room dispensary and offices To this were 
added from time to time three adjacent cottages each accom 
modating about ten patients The whole was under the 
charge of Dr Ramsbottom the Principal Medical Officer of 
the Free State forces with DrsBidwell andJHall as assistants 
These were aided from time to time by the various doctors 
attached to the commandos in the field For the last few 
weeks however Dr Hall was absolutely sin glehanded the 
other medical men having been withdrawn elsewhere The 
nursing staff at first consisted of the matron and two nurses 
from the Bloemfontein Hospital  later four other nurses from 
Bloemfontein and several Jacobsdal ladies were added There 
were several ambulance men recruited from various places 
but none of them had had any previous training although two 
were chemists One of the chemists was in charge of the 
rray apparatus The supply of instruments was good The 
fittings generally were fair and the beds were spring mat 
tresses sent from Bloemfontein and Pretoria 
The German Ambulance 
Just before the British occupation of Jacobsdal the whole 
place was taken over by the German ambulance which was 
splendidly equipped with the very latest appliances including 
its own oil engine and dynamo for the ray The staff of 
tiis ambulance consisted of three surgeons four nurses and 
five trained ambulance men besides a man in charge of the 
rray apparatus Operations were few No major amputa 
tions were performed Several fractures of the thigh and 
upper arm healed perfectly in two months One case of a 
compound smash just above the ankle was very notable The 
bone had been comminuted most extensively and the wound 
of exit was very large The patient was a man of the Lancers 
The wound healed perfectly It may be mentioned that the 
climate about this part of the country is dry and favourable 
in every way to aseptic surgery and to convalescence 
The Boer Commando System 
To understand the general working of th Boer system of 
medical aid one must look at the military system of the 
Republics The units are commandos from each district 
which act more or less independently of each other and 
maintain their own personnel in everything This organisation 
led to what is practically the old English regimental system 
of medical administration Outside the hospitals there was 
nothing that one could call a departmental organisation Each 
commando or part thereof when divided as was occasionally 
done in the case of large commandos had a doctor attached 
as long as themedical supply lasted which was in the case 
of the Free State longer than with the sister Republic owing 
to there being less prejudice against English surgeons Each 
of these doctors had four to eight ambulance men almost 
entirely without training employed mostly as dressers The 
bearers were generally Kaffirs A spring waggon was used for 
conveying wounded At Jacobsdal were three or four other spring 
waggons which were sent out from time to time to the battle 
fields The surgeon remained with his commando that is 
actually with the fighting line First aid was rendered to 
wounded men on the field and splints roughly applied but 
nothing of the nature of an operation was performed The 
wounded were then at once transported either to Jacobsdal or 
to Boshof or Koffyfontein where hospitals similar to those at 
Jacobsdal were established The surgeon of the commando 
usually accompanied his own wounded and remained at the 
hospital for some days This provided each hospital with a 
staff of floating assistants after each battle At Magers 
fontein which as your readers know was held for a long 
time there were a certain number of what might be called 
 
field hospitals established in farmhouses when available 
in tents when they were not 
It will be seen from this sketch of the medical arrangements 
on the Western Borderand they appear to have been sub 
stantially the same elsewherethat the Boer organisation has 
been practically that of corps surgeons rendering first aid and 
stationary hospitals On the Natal side there has been prac 
tically a base hospital added at Pretoria and Johannesburg 
But no organised system of collection existed and nothing 
that could be called a field hospital as we understand it It is 
obvious that such a system although it may have answered 
fairly well with Boers defending certain positions at which 
they remained for long periods and from which they only re 
treated to points nearer their stationary hospitals must utterly 
break down with large numbers of wounded over a shifting 
area of country such as is the condition under which fighting 
is now going on in the Free State Even earlier it has begun 
to break down with the splitting up of the Boer force between 
the West Colesberg and the Eastern Frontier The amount 
of suffering which such a  
system 
 would bring about if the 
Boers moved far away from their base and clear of a railway 
line is awful to contemplate But on the whole it seems to 
me that the Free State arrangements were better thought out 
than those of the sister Bepublic and more honestly adminis 
tered 
Management op Enteric Fever 
Curiously enough these temporary hospitals which I have 
called 
 
field hospitals were principally used for medical 
cases some of the cases of enteric fever being treated there 
right through But as a rule the patients were sent to 
Jacobsdal where special enteric hospitals were extemporised 
out of the Dutch reformed and Kaffir churches They accom 
modated together about eighty patients and Dr Hall had 
charge of all these most of the time in addition to his other 
work Dr Hall tells me that enteric fever constituted the 
main 
part 
of the medical work dysentery being curiously 
enough conspicuous by its absence The dietetic treatment

of typhoid fever presented much difficulty owing to the 
scarcity of milk Dr Hall tells me that he has had to make 
twentyfour bottles imperial pints go round sixty patients 
Maizena and various makeshifts had to be used to eke out this 
scanty supply Otherwise food was fairly plentiful j   
The Boer Wounded 
Dr Hall does not feel justified in giving me any statistics 
about the actual numbers of Boer wounded but he took in at 
Jacobsdal most of the cases from Belmont and the succeeding 
battle The most fatal cases were head wounds Coinciding 
with our experience in Capetown he found that perforating 
wounds of the abdomen as well as those of the chest did 
almost uniformly well One unfortunate individual had a 
bullet wound right through the abdomen shell wounds above 
and below the left knee similar shell wounds above the left 
elbow and a fracture of the left radius and ulna He re 
covered most satisfactorily 
NOTES ON THE BASE HOSPITALS IN CAPE 
COLONY 
By Sir William Thomson 
Chief Surgeon IrishHospital South Africa 
Capetoum February 25th 1900  
Accompanied by Lord Iveaghs son Hon Rupert Guinness 
I arrived here in the Norham Castle on Thursday last for ser 
vice with th Irish Hospital We were a day over the ships 
usual time for we had two bursts of heavy weather and our 
earlier hopes of a good run were thus disappointed Our last 
three days were unusually bad owing to a strong southeaster 
and a heavy head sea but we came in sight of Table Moun 
tain early on February 22nd and by 7 oclock we had heard of 
the relief of Kimberley 
Capetown has only one interest just now The subject of 
the war pervades ail conversation  the signs of it are present 
everywhere There is a crowd of transports in the bay in 
the streets khaki uniforms are many I have seen here our 
own men from home and the splendid soldiers whom New 
South Wales New Zealand Queensland and Ceylon have 
sent to help Some variety is lent to the monotonous khaki 
by the Indian syces who come in charge of horses from that 
country men made conspicuous by their brilliant turbansj 
some wearing medals some who will see war for the first time 
The Portland Hospital 
I was anxious to see some of the base hospitals here and 
oh February 23rd I spent some time at the Portland at 
Rondebosch I was fortunate enough to meet Mr Bowlby 
and some of his colleagues and also an old friend 
from Ireland Surgeon 
 
Major Kilkelly of the Grenadier 
Guards 
Rondebosch is a suburb of Capetown and the site for the 
hospital is alongside that of No 
3 
General Hospital on a 
clear sandy ground about 100 feet above sea level There is 
a good water supply Pines grow round about very freely 
and the roads are pleasantly cool and otherwise excellent 
The hospital is very well equipped The operation tent is 
boarded and in the kitchen concrete has been laid down as 
flooring The cooking arrangements are very good There 
are several ranges but of course all this is only possible at 
the base The tents are of the tortoise pattern I found the 
men occupying excellent wirewoven beds and nothing 
was wanting to make their comfort and convalescence 
secure 
Some of the cases were of especial interest and I may 
mention a few of those J saw 
Perforating Wound of Upper Jaw and NecjcA Grenadier Guard was in the 
firing line lying prone as he took aim A Mauser bullet struck him in 
the right eye passed downwards and to the left through the soft palate 
continued its course through the floor of the mouth emerged from the 
neck at the anterior edge of the sternomastoid and again entering above 
the clavicle smashed that bone That happened at Magersf ontein Today 
all the wounds are healed There is not any indication of a scar about the 
eyelids The bullet went in without touching either The man suffers 
from huskiness and Mr Bowlby told me there was some laryngeal 
paralysis but the patient is otherwise perfectly well  
Multiple Bullet WoundsNear him lay a man belonging I think to the 
Warwickshire regiment A lieutenant and six men tried to storm a 
kopje but it proved too great an undertaking and they had to retire 
Xfie patient was struck at the outer edge of the left scapula The bullet  
emerged in front 2 inches above the nipple He fell and was imme 
diately attacked by a Boer who emptied the remainder of his magazine 
at him One bullet entered above the left anterior superior spinona pro 
cess and coursed backwards through the muscles and another went 
through the soft part of his left leg This man was quite well except 
that fre had some mood in the left thorax The wounds all ran an aseptic 
course 
  
Bullet Wound of Brain  Trephining  RecoveryA young soldier was 
lying in bed looking as if nothing was the matter with him He had been 
trephined five days before When admitted he had a bullet wound in the 
vertex He was partially insensible but had no localising symptoms 
His temperature then was 102  The operation disclosed several frag 
ments of bone embedded in the brain and also part of the nickel cover 
ing of the bullet He was quite free from fever or other symptoms and 
he told me he felt all right 
Bullet Woundiof TarsusI saw another lad with an interesting injury 
 A 
bullet entered at the tip of the inner malleolus passed slightly obliquely 
outwards and upwards traversed the astragalus and made its exit 
through the centre of the outer malleolus The wounds were quite healed 
All that remained were two scars of the area of the end of a lead pencil 
The motion of the joint was all right and there was no effusion of any kind 
to indicate a recent injury 
There had been four cases of fractured femur from bullet 
wounds There was much bone splintering but all had done 
well Mr Bowlby bore high testimony to the management 
of these cases at the front All came down most carefully 
dressed  an aseptic case was rarely eeen 
The Base Hospitals at Wynbebg 
On February 24th I went to Wynberg where I was glad to 
meet an old fellowstudent LieutenantColonel Greer 
B AMC one of the officers in charge Later on Mr Makins 
the Civilian Consulting Surgeon joined us and gave me much 
pleasure in the narration of the work being done at this great 
base hospital 
The name of Wynberg is so well known at home that it is 
unnecessary to do more than say it is eight miles from Cape 
town and is normally the military camp The range of large 
commodious huts have all been converted into hospital 
wards and there is accommodation for 600 patients The air 
is clear and cool and there is a pleasant surrounding shade of 
pine trees through which here and there views of the sea can 
be had 
There were not many serious cases in when I visited There 
were two or three fractures of the femur which were getting 
well slowly but Mr Makins believed the result would be 
good In these and other cases where there had been much 
destruction there was considerable suppuration following 
necrosis but the amount of shortening was very slight and in 
some cases there was none 
Bullet Wound of Shoulder JointAn officer whom I saw had his left 
humrus divided through the surgical neck by a splinter of shell There 
was of course a considerable wound Mr Makins determined to try to 
save the arm union of bone had taken place and it is probable that 
there will ultimately be a useful arm Nearly all the spinal cases have 
done badly 
I was interested to visit the Boer prisoners They were a 
fine lot of men and those of them who were out of bed were 
in high good spirits I chatted with several of them about 
their injuries I found that many of them belonged to 
European nationalities and that the pure Boer was only a per 
centage These however all spoke English just as one hears 
it at home 
Perforating LeeMetford Bullet Wound of ChestOne man a Dane told me 
he was wounded at Magersfontein on December nth He was one of the 
Scandinavian picket and he said that twothirds of them were killed 
He had a remarkable wound The bullet entered just below the apex of 
the heart and passing through the thorax came out at the eighth inter 
space on the right side in the midaxillary line He was out of bed all 
the wounds were quite healed and he appeared to be in good health 
Case of SnakebiteOne boy aged 17 told me he was in hospital for 
snakebite I learned that there had been much cellulitis of the hand 
and forearm but he was recovering He was taken at Elandslaagte He 
said his father was in the Town Guard at Kimberley Here was an in 
stance of father and son fighting on opposite sides 
The prisoners occupied the same class of ward as our own 
men and were treated in precisely the same way They had 
comfortable wirewoven mattresses mosquito curtains etc 
and the only indication that they were prisoners was the 
presence of a sentry outside the door 
All the wards were large airy well lighted and well ven 
tilatpd So far as such comforts go nothing could have been 
better 
Aseptic Wounds 
One of the facts which have been established thus far is the 
marvellous success which has followed the effort to keep 
wounds aseptic It must always be remembered that the 
first dressings are made under the greatest disadvantages

and that the patients pass quickly out of the hands of the 
surgeons at the front They do not of course know what the 
results are in more than a tithe of the cases At base hos 
pitals such as Wynberg and Rondebosch the cases are treated 
tou termination and it is high testimonyto the efficiency of 
the work on the field that the results are so surprising 
Are Modern Bullets too Merciful 
Another fact is no longer new  that the modern smallbore 
bullet is more merciful than the bullet of the Snider or the 
Martini Indeed I have heard that a foreign attach has 
expressed the view that there must be some reversion to older 
forms Already the Boers have been trying to make their fire 
more deadly not by using a softnosed bullet but by splitting 
up the nickel covering so that it may spread and cause a more 
severe wound Lord Robertseports that such missiles have1 
been found upon prisoners captured at Paardeberg This may 
not be a general custom but as I am under orders for Naauw 
poort I may be able to inform you on this point in a future 
letter

From our Special Correspondent 
 
Capetotvn February 28th 
 
Surgical Cases 
The German hospitals have had little new lately except that 
a few cases from the neighbourhood of Colesbrg and now 
that No 6 has been established at Nauuwpoort these will 
probably be dealt with there There Will of course be a big 
rush during the next few days at least this is anticipated as 
No 6 will hardly be able to absorb all the cages coming front 
Robertas column including as they will an enormous num 
ber of Boer wounded I have had an opportunity of seeing 
several interesting convalescent surgical cases at No 1 
General Hospital during the last week They show conclu 
sively the excellence of the surgical work done 
Splinter Wounds of Shoulder and NeckOne man Who had 
been wounded at a place called Strydfontein had a curiott 
mass of wounds about the left shoulder and neck He was 
lying down firing and the Boers were advancing A bullet 
struck a rock close to him and the shoulder and neck were 
absolutely riddled with largish fragments He says that the 
place where the rock was struck was not more than four to six 
inches away from him A number of pieces of rock and lead 
were taken out The shoulderjoint escaped and no nrvea 
were injured at least there is no paralysis 
Ecpanding Bullet WoundsThis was evidently an expanding 
bullet for a comrade was hit by the same Boer directly the 
little finger being carried off and then the jaw smashed in a 
way that could not have been done by a Mauser That the 
Boers are using explosivebullets and expansive bullets 
largely is certain The writer has in his possession quite a 
number of such taken from  Boer  bandoliers including the 
murderous sporting  Mauser cartridgeI mean the bullet 
which is used for elephants and such fer naturae 
Injury of Muscuhspiral NerveIn another case a bullet 
which had penetrated the chest had then gone into the upper 
arm and evidently injured the musculospiral nerve The 
man has dropped wrist and other evidences of musculospiral 
paralysis with impaired but not abolished sensation In 
another case the first part of the axillary artery had had to be 
tied on account of secondary heemorrhagefrom a bullet wound 
penetrating the shoulder and emerging low down in the 
axilla The case did admirably 
 
Shell Wound of Leg  Suppuration 
 
of Eme   
Secondary 
Ha 
morrhagel have seen again a case which I reported in one 
of my earlier letters of a shell wound of the leg with com 
mencing purulent trouble in thetaeejoint This mans leg 
naB had to be amputated in the middle third of the thigh 
secondary haemorrhage from the posteriortibial precipitating 
an issue which was impending on account of the effasion into 
the knee 
Comminuted Fractures of HumrusAnother case at No 1 
General Hospital shows how admirably bone injuries are 
 managed A nullet presumably softnosed had entered the 
5 upper arm in front about 4 inches above the elbowjoint and 
had emerged by a wound s by 2 inches behind smashing i urrthe humrus onthe way Fully an inch of the humeras 
was destroyed 
 
This wound kept aseptic throughout and 
after his arrival here there was no rise of temperature The 
limb was put up in a poroplastic splint 
and irrigated with 
sublimate solution and is now rapidly healing 
Increase of Enteric Fever 
Cases of enteric fever are steadily increasing in number at 
the whole of the hospitals but the disease in proportion ta 
the number engaged is not so large in Robertas and 
Methuens commands as on the frontier This is what one 
would expect from the climatic conditions I understand 
that it is very rife in Natal The cases do as a rule fairly well 
but as is observable always in this country the temperature 
keeps up a long time The medical officer in charge of the 
enteric fever ward at the Station Hospital informs me that he 
was struck with the much greater proportion of cases show 
ing a rash than in civil practice in the Colony 
The Portland Hospital 
 The fol lowing cases of interest in the Portland Hospital 
may be added to those published last week  
Another remarkable case in the Portland Hospital is one in 
which a bullet entered the right orbit passed diagonally 
downwards and to the left through the soft palate emerged just 
behind the left sternomastoid about at the level of the fifth 
cervical vertebra then hit the left clavicle and glanced along 
it for about h inch splintering it on the way The man has 
paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal the left vocal cord being 
quite fixed and Mr Bowlby is convinced that the pneumo 
gastric is divided although there are no symptoms distinctly 
pointing to this Considering the track of the wound and the 
laryngeal paralysis Mr Bowlbys inference seems incontro 
vertible 
Another interesting case in the Portland Hospital was one 
of trephining A bullet or fragment of shell had entered the 
vertex just in the line of prolongation of the Bolandic fissure 
but absolutely in the middle line consequently no motor 
symptoms were observed A good deal of bruised tissue came 
away but the patient when I saw him two days after operation 
was absolutely compos mentis and conversing naturally and 
had no elevation of temperature 
Compound fractures of the femur have been treated hitherto 
by simple extension and have done admirably Both Mr 
Bowlby and Mr Wallace however intend using Hodgens 
splint as soon as they can obtain them As an illustration of 
the success of conservative surgery in this war Mr Bowlby 
informs me that not a single amputation of any kind has 
been performedin the Portland Hospital as yet

by the help of God and the bravery of Her Majestys 
soldiers 
 
the troops under his command had taken possession 
of Bloemfontein 
Bloemfontein the capital of the Orange Free Statej is in 
the middle of the flat grass plains constituting the inland 
plateau In 1S46 it was made the headquarters of a British 
Resident and a mall British force at a time when the 
Orange 
State was the Orange Sovereignty under British ruler It is 
now once more the headquarters of a British Resident and a 
British force 
The town stands on the plain  and has in its vicinity one of 
the continuallyrecurring South African kopjes in this 
instance in the shape of a long flattopped hill The streets

in the town all run at right angles to one another and nearly 
every house has its garden and trees shading it The Presi 
dency now the headquarters of Lord Roberts is a hand 
some modern villa with cactus aloes and other subtropical 
plants growing in its gardens In many parts of the town 
trees are growing in the streets Bloemfontein and the 
country round it stands at an elevation of 4500 feet above 
sea level It is as many of the correspondents have already 
stated a pleasant little town and Bloemfontein together 
with the Dutch farms in the vicinity have often been recom 
mended as particularly good health resorts for phthisical 
patients 
The natural features of the climate are extreme dryness of 
air brilliancy of atmosphere and continuous 
sunshine 
with 
only an occasional thunderstorm in the summer It is im 
probable that there will be any rain after this month  and 
for six months to come Bloemfontein will have over it a sky 
which seldom or never contains a cloud The weather will 
become much colder about the month of May and the tor 
menting half gale of the high veld will prove a not infrequent 
annoyance At night it is not at all unusual to get sharp 
frosts although the bright sunshine of the daytime in 
variably raises the temperature considerably over freezing 
point In June and July warm clothing is essential by day 
as well as by night Of all garments for the soldier there is 
nothing at this time of year so serviceable as a good thick 
sweater  he can wear it under his tunic by day and sleep in 
it at night 
The physical features of Bloemfontein and the portions of 
the Free State in which it stands together with its climate 
are thus excellent The country is about as healthy as 
Nature can make it  only man is vile The sanitation of 
Bloemfontein is very far from perfect and hence epidemics 
of typhoid fever have on several occasions occurred in the 
town The system in vogue is the pail system or removal of 
the night soil by night in waggons This system is theoretic 
ally an excellent one but the least carelessness in the 
sanitary service renders it both obnoxious and dangerous 
In my experience wherever this theoretically perfect system 
is in vogue as it almost invariably is in all South African towns 
the degree of carelessness necessary to produce the obnoxious 
and dangerous conditions referred to is always displayed 
With regard to the water supply I am not sufficiently well 
informed to be able to speak of it with certainty Bloemfon 
tein however as pointed out stands on a fiat country and is 
at a considerable distance from any river conditions not 
favourable to an abundant and liberal water supply As 
illustrating the almost level character of the plateau between 
Kimberley and Bloemfontein it is interesting to note that a 
difference in the altitude in these towns is only 140 feet Kim 
berley being exactly 4360 feet above the sea Lord Roberts 
in his telegram of March 20th states that uthe people of 
Bloemfontein are affording us every assistance in the matter 
of hospital accommodation and we have consequently been 
able to arrange for 500 beds A telegram from the Times 
correspondent states that the New South Wales Ambulance 
Corps which is under the command of Major Fiaschi Surgeon 
to theSydney Hospital NSW has been placed in charge of 
these 500 beds 
The Basuto Border 
Travelling east of Bloemfontein towards Ladybrand the 
plains begin to rise more markedly until the strip of fertile 
country known as the Conquered Territory which was 
originally possessed by the Basutos is reached On the borders 
of this territory is situated the old missionary station at 
Thabanchu Lord Robertas despatch published on March 
19th says that a cavalry brigade has gone to this district in 
order to reassure the inhabitants in that part of the country 
and distribute copies of the proclamation laying down the 
conditions on which burghers will be allowed to return to their 
homes Through this territory the country continues to rise 
until the valley of the Caledon river is reached This is a 
swift stream with steep banks and on the eastern side of it 
is the Switzerland of South AfricaBasutoland The 
 
Con 
quered Territory  is a magnificent piece of country with a 
climate almost as cool as our own It enjoys clear skies bright 
sunshine very little mist and its rain falls in storms I once 
spent a fortnight travelling in this country and into Basuto 
land to the foot of the Maluti mountains After the arid 
sandy plains of the Modder Biver and Kimberley it will be a 
comparatively cool and delightful land for our cavalry to find 
themselves in The elevation of this district is about 5000feet 
above the sea and its cool summer climate is much like that 
of the Johannesburg district in the Transvaal The country 
is fertile and the corn is grown readily without irrigation In 
the midst of this country stands a beautiful and luxurious 
home a rich mans hobby a house which took over four years 
to build situated in wild mountainous scenery and surrounded 
by a million planted trees of every variety and shade of foliage 
An instance of what the country is capable and what its 
climate produces it stands like an oasis in the veld A few 
notes of this estate may be of interest The owner is an 
Englishman his wife the daughter of the missionary who 
founded the station at Thabanchu who speaks Basuto like a 
native and is beloved and almost worshipped by the Basutos 
The house stands under a precipitous and weatherbeaten 
krnz or cliff and looks down over a widecovered grass 
amphitheatre surrounded by hills From the foot of a 
beautiful flower garden rises a great stretch of woods and 
plantations for some miles out into this natural amphitheatre 
Here in a naturally treeless country firs poplars oaks gum 
trees ash and the broom planta genesta all grow in 
luxurious abundance a living monument of energy and enter 
prise In the glades of these woods wander zebra and antelope 
while from the trees come alternately the harsh cry of 
the guinea fowl and the cooing of the turtle dove The 
bright plumage of the honey sucker flashes from flower t 
flower in the sunshine of the garden  overhead above the 
trees against the sky the noblest of his kind the blue rock 
pigeon cuts his swift way from krnz to krnz From the 
cliffs behind the house away to the eastward distant a days 
journey into Basutoland may be seen the broken serried 
peaks and rugged outlines of the Maluti mountains In 
these mountains are peaks over 10000 feet high notably the 
Mont aux Sources In these mountains to the northeast 
there rise the Orange Tugela and some of the tributaries of 
the Vaal rivers They are a grand range running parallel to 
and at only a short distance from the main line of the 
Drakensberg  they form the greatest mass and contain the 
highest peaks anywhere south of the Zambesi On the slopes 
of these mountains and in the fertile valleys between them 
and the Caledon river the Basutos chiefly dwell They are 
perhaps the most intelligent of the great Bantu race 
Colonial Prisoners at Pretoria 
In my last letter I drew special attention to the treat 
ment accorded by the Boer executive to the Colonial pri 
soners at Pretoria Before that letter was in the press a 
question had been addressed on the subject to Lord Lans 
downe and an assurance given that should the reports with 
reference to these prisoners be authenticated strong repre 
sentations would immediately be made 
The Siege Statistics from Ladysmith 
We have already had occasion to quote some few statistics 
with reference to the siege of Ladysmith The Special Corre 
spondent of the Standard now supplements the interesting 
despatches on this subject already received from him by the 
following dated Ladysmith March 17th  
In November the garrison consisted of 572 officers and 12924 men in 
March it had been reduced to 403 officers and 9761 men The admissions 
to hospital numbered 10668 including 1766 cases of enteric fever and 1857 
of dysentery The deaths were 600 including 393 from the former disease 
and 117 from the latter The patients in hospital on March ist numbered 
1996708 of whom were suffering from enteric fever 341 from dysentery 
and 189 from wounds Other figures are as follows  Died of wounds 59  
killed in action 18 officers 193 men  killed in assaults and sorties 17 
officers and x6o men  killed by the bombardment 2 officers 33 men  
wounded in assaults and sorties 45 officers 352 men In November there 
were in Ladysmith 5309 horses and 4539 mules At the end of the siege 
the horses numbered 2900 of which only 500 were effective and the mules 
37x3 The rations which in November were issued for 40 days were 
towards the end made to extend over 120 days 
To make this statement absolutely complete it would be 
interesting to know whether the deaths from disease referred 
to occurred entirely among the officers and men of the 
garrison  or whether they include the deaths among the 
civilian population European and native of which there were 
a considerable number in 
Ladysmith 
Until we are quite 
clear on this point it is impossible to work out exactly the 
deathrate although it is quite obvious that in any case this 
was terribly high

DEATHS FROM DISEASE 
In the British Medical Journal of March 3rd we had to 
record the rather rapid rise in the number of deaths from 
disease in the force in South Africa In the week ending 
February 17th the deaths from disease numbered 50 but in 
the following week they rose to 117 taking the force to be 
about 180000 men this amounted to a deathrate of nearly 34 
Ser 
mille per annum In the week ending March 3rd the 
eaths from disease fell to 92 a deathrate of about 265 per 
mille per annum but in the following week they rose again 
to 115 which would give a deathrate of about 33 per mille 
per annum In the week ending March 17th they again 
dropped to 93 which gives a deathrate of nearly 27 per mille 
per annum 
SCOTTISH SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITAL 
The members of the surgical and nursing staffs in uniform 
attended the military service in St Giles Cathedral in the 
morning of Sunday March 18th The surgical staff headed 
by Professor Chiene were in khaki An appropriate service 
was conducted by the Rev Dr Theodore Marshall Acting 
Chaplain to the Forces At the close of the service the medi 
cal staff marched to the Royal Exchange Square where they 
were briefly addressed by Lord Provost Mitchell Thompson 
They sail on March 24th We understand that Miss Florence 
Nightingale has given a donation of 100 towards the funds of 
the hospital Dr Francis D Boyd goes as Physician to the 
Hospital 
DESPATCHES 
The London Gazette of March 16th publishes despatches 
from Lord Roberts forwarding the reports of Lord Methuen 
and Sir William Gatacre respectively describing the opera 
tions on the Modder River on December 10th and nth 1899 
and at Stormberg on December 10th 
In summing up the result of the engagements and bringing 
to notice the services of officers Lord Methuen says   
Major 
ODormell Royal Army Medical Corps and Lieutenant Delap 
Royal Army Medical Corps were indefatigable in attending 
wounded under fireLieutenant Douglas Royal Army 
Medical Corps showed great gallantry and devotion under a 
very severe fire in advancing in the open and attending to 
Captain Gordon Gordon Highlanders who was wounded 
also attending to Major Robinson and other wounded men 
ander a fearful fire 
General Gatacre specially mentions only two of the officers 
who served under him at Stormberg and beyond that he was 
accompanied by LieutenantColonel Edge Principal Medical 
Officer has nothing to say of the medical officers present with 
him
