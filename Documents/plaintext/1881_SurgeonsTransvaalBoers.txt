May7i88i THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURAAL 729 
next year the Council decided to request the licensing bodies to take 
into consideration the possibility of holding such preliminary scientific 
examinations as were suggested 
A proposal made by Mr Macnamara that the Council should re 
commend the holding of yearly examinations which the student should 
be required to pass before proceeding with other departments of 
medical study was rejected the proposer and seconder Dr McClin 
tock alone voting for it 
The Council exercised its judicial function in the case of Samuel 
Levenston a graduate of Medicine of the University of Glasgow who 
was charged with the circulation in Glasgow and the neighbourhood 
of pamphlets and handbills of an improper character Dr Levenston 
appeared in answer to the summons issued and was ably defended by 
counsel In his examination the fact of the distribution of the docu 
ments was admitted  but the plea was raised that although such con 
duct was highly unprofessional and improper it was nevertheless not 
in the words of the Medical Act 
 
infamous in a professional respect 
The Council however decided that Levenston had been guilty of such 
conduct and ordered that his name should be erased from the Medical 
Register 
The Report of the Finance Committee showed that the income of 
the General and Branch Councils in 1880 was 6871 19s and the 
expenditure 5303 18s the excess of income over expenditure being 
1568 is In no previous year during the last seven years has there 
been so great a surplus  indeed in four of the years there were defi 
ciencies amounting in 1874 to 878 in 1875 to 820 in 1877 to 
649 and in 1878 to 116 whilst the surplus years were 1876 with 
374 and 1879 with 961 On the other hand the balancesheet of 
the Dental Registration Fund showed a less satisfactory state of 
affairs the income for the year amounting to only 616 7s 3d and 
the expenditure to 1808 10s 7d leaving a deficiency of 1192 3s 4d 
to be met from the capital fund and reducing the balance in hand from 
10489 at the beginning of the year to 9296 at the end of the year 
The treasurers calculated that there will probably be an annual future 
excess of expenditure over income in the matter of Dental Registration 
amounting to about 800 
Some business connected with the Dentists Act was transacted 
An application by thirty registered dentists that their titles as surgeons 
should be placed on the Dentists Register was after some debate 
assented to This determination of the Council is at variance with pre 
vious proceedings and while much may nodpubtbe said in favour 
of allowing the more extensivelyeducated dentists to make known the 
fact that they are also duly qualified surgeons a question may be raised 
as to the strict legality of the action taken by the Council 
 
A few 
doubtful cases of registration were considered and dealt with according 
to their merits 
The visitation of examinations has been resumed and is being con 
ducted for the Council by Mr Teale of Leeds Professor Gairdner of 
Glasgow and Professor Stokes of Dublin No report has been pre 
sented this year  but it may be expected from the known competency 
of the writers that in another year much valuable information will be 
laid before the Council and the profession 
ARMYSURGEONS AND THE LATE BATTLES AGAINST 
THE TRANSVAAL BOERS 
We have received from time to time while the war was in progress 
reports of the admirable conduct and distinguished bravery of the army 
medical officers who accompanied the troops in the recent military 
operations on the Natal frontier against the Transvaal Boers The 
number of surgeons who lost their lives and of those who were 
wounded in the various actions that took plac sufficiently testified to 
the fact that there was no lack of courageous devotion to duty on the 
part of the officers of the medical service We are gratified in receiving 
equally satisfactory accounts of the excellent manner in which the hos 
pitals in front have been conducted and the wounded patients in them 
attended to A communication recently received from Fort Amiel 
near Newcastle mentions that there have been very few deaths among 
the large number of wounded that were brought there from the last 
action at Majuba Hill as well as from the previous actions in the 
neighbourhood  while some men suffering from wounds of the severest 
kind including several gunshot fractures of the thigh and penetrating 
wounds of the lungs are now making favourable progress toward com 
plete recovery 
A leading article purporting to be what may be called a review of 
the medical campaign during the operations against the Boers has 
appeared in one of the last numbers that has reached this country of 
the Natal Witness an influential newspaper published at Pietermaritz 
burg The article is too long to be repeated  but we are tempted to 
make a short extract from it not merely on account of the remarks 
being so creditable as they are to all concerned but because they can 
not fail to afford satisfaction to many persons in this country who have 
had relatives or friends among the wounded in the distant colony of 
Natal by showing how thoroughly their necessities have been looked 
after both in the field itself and in the hospitals where they have been 
afterwards placed for care and treatment 
 If a retrospective contemplation of the war now brought to a close 
is not wholly a pleasant one says the article in question there is 
one feature at all events which we can regard with unmixed satisfac 
tion The treatment of our wounded men on the field and in hospital 
by our army surgeons would appear by general assent to have never 
been surpassed At the action of Langes Nek the dressingstation for 
the wounded had been fixed near to the guns  but as the 58th Regi 
ment advanced and the men were falling rapidly Drs Ring and 
McGann moved up behind the advancing column and on its retire 
ment remained amidst a hail of bullets attending to the wounded 
The native bearers on this occasionand on this occasion onlyalso 
did their duty bravely bringing in the wounded on stretchers to the 
fieldhospital At the final disaster at Majuba Hill the officers of the 
medical service remained faithful to their duties even unto death Dr 
Cornish was shot as with a piper of the 92nd Highlanders he was 
carrying a wounded man on a stretcher that had been abandoned by its 
bearers Dr Landon always keen for duty in the field and taking a 
special pride in his Army Hospital Corps met his fate at the final rush 
of the Boers as with a few of his men he was engaged seeing to the 
wounded on the ridges The ruling passion strong in death he called 
Dr Babingtons attention shortly before he expired to the meritorious 
conduct of his men  and well he might Private Farmer Army Hos 
pitai Corps with both his arms broken and in splints wandered afcUt 
that dreadful hill all night aiding the wounded as best he could We 
hear that Sir Evelyn Wood has recommended this man for a Victoria 
Gross It is conduct that would certainly commend itself to that gal 
lant soldier With such deeds to record and the excellent provisin 
made to meet the demand of about three hundred and fifty grievously 
wounded menbefore tooreinforcements of medical men and material 
could arrive from EnglandSurgeonGeneral Holloway has every caus 
to be proud of his department The strain on it under such excep 
tional circumstances has doubtless been great but it has been met 
Dr Holloway wisely availed himself of the liberality of the several 
societies hurriedly formed at Durban in this city and at Newcastle to 
succour the wounded  and by them every comfort and luxury not sup 
plied by Government that kindness could suggest has been freely con 
tributed 
THE MILKEPIDEMIC IN ABERDEEN 
The outbreak of a new disease is always a matter of great importance 
both for the patient and the physician That a new form of disease has 
recently appeared in Aberdeen seems quite certain  and that it was 
connected in some way or other with the milksupply seems also cer 
tain from a consideration of the following facts Near the town of 
Aberdeen there is a reformatory school called the Old Mill where 
over one hundred and fifty boys are carefully looked after with a view 
to the cure of their moral obliquities and where they may learn an 
honest trade likely to be useful to them in afterlife The reformatory
