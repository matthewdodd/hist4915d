THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE IRISH HOSPITAL AT PRETORIA 
By Sir William Thomson FRCSI 
SurgeoninChief 
Pretoria July Jfih 
When I sent you my last letter we had just begun our work in 
the new domicile which we were fortunate enough to acquire 
We had set up house on a very large scale without deliberate 
preparation and we were suffering all the inconveniences of 
uch an enterprise Still no patient suffered Those upon 
whom the strain and stress fell were the few who had under 
taken the work determined that it should succeed The 
Hospital Board took over the building on June 15th 
The Medical and Nursing Staff 
On the 19th I transferred all the patients 83 remaining in 
the Irish hospital on the field It was a hard aays work We 
had no nurses  there were five orderlies one dresser Mr 
Thomson Dr Coleman and myself Each man had to be 
undressed and washed before being put into clean sheets 
But we took off our coats to it helped to arrange the beds and 
generally did orderly work all round Dr Coleman dis 
tinguished physician as he is never appeared to greater ad 
vantage and I give to him and to the rest of my small party 
not only my own thanks but those of the sick whom they so 
tenderly managed that day Since then the rest of our estab 
lishment has come up from Bloemfontein and now consists of 
Dr George Stoker Dr J B Coleman Dr Friel Dr 
Counihan Dr Pounden and the following extra physicians 
Dr Yon Gernet and Dr Haylett registrar Mr Rhodes 
dressers Messrs Stewart Macllwaine Thomson and 
Edwards  matron Miss MacDonnell  assistant matron Miss 
Walker both of the Richmond Hospital Dublin In addition 
I have succeeded in getting twenty nursing sisters and 
I have supplemented our own Irish orderlies by a number of 
convalescents In this way we have got into harness But as 
our medical staff is less than half that deemed necessary in 
an army 520bed general hospital it will be seen that the work 
is arduous 
Several of the residentsMessrs Heys Bechett Marks 
Lewis and Johnstonhave selected wards to equip and the 
Hon Rupert Guinness has especially furnished the Iveagh 
ward named after his father We have got as a result sick 
quarters which would be the envy of many a hospital managed 
at home The furniture and bedding are of the best  on the 
walls are engravings of excellent quality giving to the wards 
rather the aspect of comfortable dwelling rooms than anything 
else 
We have erected a fine kitchen with five  
ranges 
 and as 
many boilers for soup etc The sanitary arrangements I 
have already described in a previous letter Altogether 
things work with the smoothness of an oldestablished hos 
pital 
Opening of the Hospital by Lord Roberts 
On July 1 ith Field Marshal Lord Roberts formally opened 
the hospital He was accompanied by Lady Roberts Lady 
Settrington and the Hon Aileen Roberts There were also 
present the Military Governor General Maxwell Lord 
Kitchener General KellyKenny Colonel Steveneon PM0 
Mrs Louis Botha and Mrs Lucas Meyer Lord Stanley the 
 Burgomaster Mr Loveday Mr Leigh Wood Hon Rupert 
Guinness members of the Hospital Board and a large 
number of the civilians of Pretoria 
After many of the wards had been visited Lord Roberts made 
a short speech in which he eulogised the work done and as 
an Irishman he said he was glad that the Irish Hospital had 
been the first to open there lie thanked Mr Leigh Wood for 
the aid he had given to the British prisoners at Waterval in 
securing for them medical attendance and comforts Subse 
quently tea was served in the Board room and the visitors 
book was signed the first signature being Lord Roberts Lady 
Palace of Justice Pretoria now used as a hospital by the Irish Hospital Corps

Roberts Hon Aileen Roberts Mrs Louis Botha and 
Mrs Lucas Meyer It was an interesting incident of the 
proceedings to see this little party in conversation repre 
senting as it did the opposed forces of the war 
A Deluge of Enteric 
When we opened we were deluged with enteric cases Every 
field hospital naturally sent in its worst cases for all these 
men were lying on the veld with only the covering of a tent 
and crowded to the number of eight in a bell Some of 
them were really moribund when they arrived and these and 
many more died On one day we had nine deaths It was 
disheartening work for there was very little margin of hope 
Gradually however there has been an improvement and we 
do not receive so large a proportion of bad cases There have 
been a few wounded Two of theseone shot through the 
spine with complete division of the cord  the other through 
the colon and liverhave died Another an officer shot 
through the left kidney has made excellent progress and 
although there is still slight hsematuria he has no other 
symptoms 
Death of a Doctor 
We have now received into this building 765 patients of 
whom 248 have been discharged and 49 have died leaving 468 
at present under treatment I am sorry to report the death 
of Dr Teufel a German physician who had rendered service 
to our sick prisoners at Waterval with Dr Von Gernet He 
acquired the disease there and was admitted here but he was 
unhappily unable to resist the virulence of the attack He 
received a military funeral 
The Medical Commission 
The Medical Commission still exists and has been of the 
greatest service Some day I shall tell you more fully what it 
has done but I think I may say that in the absence of medical 
supplies and the frequent interruptions of railway communica 
tion it has saved the situation We have practically equipped 
all the stationary hospitals with blankets sheets mattresses 
underclothing bedsteads pyjamas and all kinds of drugs 
and dressings In some cases our difficulties were enormous 
Some articles could only be had by the halfdozen Clinical 
thermometers had almost vanished from the town Between 
this and Johannesburg we could only get a few bedpans 
We had to pay 16 for 24 and then we got some made at a 
pound apiece Some of the indents are amusing One 
wanted several dozen thermometers when only half a dozen 
were available in the district and then wanted 30 ear 
syringes We have furnished hospitals and nurses houses 
and we are asked to supply khaki uniforms and overcoats 
when there is not one to be had in the Transvaal The Com 
mission is a universal provider and it has borne the strain 
very well Foremost in the work are Mr Leigh Wood the 
Chairman and Mr Rupert Guinness who try to meet every 
demand now that Mr Murray Guthrie has gone home The 
CommanderinChief has given every facility for the im 
portant work and in this way as in others he has encouraged 
the efforts of the Commission His solicitude for his men 
who are enduring hardships is constant and untiring 
he Treatment of the Sick in South African Hospitals 
Rumours regarding the agitation on the treatment of 
the sick had reached us from time to time but it is 
only now that I have had a chance of reading some of what 
has been said I have not had any duty outside my own 
hospital I am not in a position to express an opinion from 
actual personal knowledge I do not doubt that great hard 
ships have been suffered I know that But there is a want of 
judicial calmness in the indictment which has swept public 
feeling with the force of a whirlwind It is so easy to make 
us 
 
creep I have already said that the Army Medical De 
partment must be reorganised  that more nurses and 
physicians should have been sent out  that sanitarians should 
be part of the force on the field There is much to find fault 
with and improve But it is fair to the department 
to say that at present its mouth is shut and that 
no member of it may come forward now and state 
his case There was a grave miscalculation as to the 
requirements of the campaign but that miscalculation was 
not confined to the RAMC I think the department is 
strangled by rules and regulations  that it is not progressive 
if you like  but all these are matters to be considered calmly 
at the close of the war and corrected It is not the only 
department that will be improved by experience Some weeks 
ago Lord Roberts appointed a Committee here under the 
presidency of Colonel Gormley RAMC to collect evidence 
regarding the treatment of wounded and sick in the field I 
was invited to state my views and I have done so in a few 
notes When the Commission of Inquiry comes out I shall 
probably give evidence I shall have faults to find But 
meantime there should be some moderation and it ought to 
be remembered that the army is eogaged in war and not in 
the peaceful pleasures of life at home 
A VISIT TO NO 7 GENERAL HOSPITAL 
ESTCORT NATAL 
By Sir William Stokes FRCSL 
Surgeon in Ordinary to H M the Queen in Ireland  Consulting Surgeon 
to the Field Forces South Africa 
We received the following letter from the late Sir William 
Stokes just a week after his lamented death The covering 
letter dated August 2nd expressed the distinguished writers 
intention to leave for home on August 24th 
On July 16th while at Ladysmith I received a telegram 
from Colonel McNeece RAMC the able Principal Medical 
Officer of the General Hospital Estcourt asking me to visit 
Estcourt with the object of seeing some surgical cases of in 
terest and importance and for some of which operative inter 
ference it was thought might be indicated I accordingly 
started the day following and reached my destination at 
about 1230 pm 
Estcourt which is the seat of magistracy of Weenan Countyr 
is situated at a high altitude 3833 feet above the sea level 
Though a small provincial town it is one of some commercial 
importance and is situated close to the junction of the Bush 
mans and the Little Bushmans river the former of which is 
crossed by a railway bridge of five spans The climate which 
has the reputation of being one of the most equable in Natal 
is dry and invigorating and it was no small relief to inhale 
the pure air of the district after the choking dust and pestilen tial atmosphere of Ladysmith There is little tillage to be 
seen the district being mainly pastoral Like most Natal 
villages it is situated in a hollow surrounded by partlywooded 
hills which form a charming contrast to the bare inhospitable 
mountains and hills which surround Ladysmith 
The site for the General Hospital No 7 was judiciously 
selected by Colonel Gallwey CB the Principal Medical 
Officer of Natal and is situated about half a mile from the 
Estcourt railway station on the Ladysmith side The area of 
the hospital covers about 60 acres on the crest and side of a 
gentlysloping hill It had never been camped on or fouled 
and water from the town reservoir was easily laid on 
On April 5th orders were received from the principal 
medical officer to increase the accommodation from 500 to 920 
beds all of which were soon occupied chiefly with enteric 
cases a large proportion of cases of dysentery being aleo 
under treatment 
The Hospital Staff 
The hospital is divided into two divisions medical and sur 
gical with subdivisions attached to each for convalescents 
Major Barker RAMC is in charge of the medical and 
Major Porter RAMC of the 
surgical division These 
officers are ably assisted by the civil medical officers 
who have done most excellent work The same may be said 
of the nursing sisters army army reserve and colonial 
Major Hayes RAMC acts as Registrar and Secretary 
The other officers originally connected with the hospital were 
Captains Beveridge Waring and Kelly Of these Captain 
Beveridge has been ordered to the front Captain Waring to a 
field hospital and Captain Kelly has been invalided 
Cases of Gunshot Wound 
Major Porter RAMC showed me several cases of gun 
shot injuries of exceptional interest most of them having 
been received in the engagement at Almonds Nek on June 
nth The first was one in which a bullet penetrated the 
right thigh and left kneejoint There was no suppuration in 
the wounds but a somewhat rigid ankylosis of the knee

supervened The limb however was in a good perfectly 
straight position Another case was one in which a bullet 
passed through the cheek into the mouth through the 
tongue and finally emerged in the submaxillary region 
The haemorrhage in this case was very great and with 
difficulty controlled  but ultimately the patient did well 
I also saw two cases of chest wounds in both of which the 
lung was perforated The bullet in the first case entered an 
inch to the left of the right nipple and emerged below the 
angle of the left scapula  and in the second case the wound 
of entrance was two and ahalf inches below the centre of the 
right clavicle and the exit three inches below the angle of 
the scapula on the same side There was copious haemoptysis 
immediately after the wounds were received which happily 
however did not recur Both cases have done well I also 
observed an interesting head injury A pompom shell 
exploded close to the patient and one fragment entered the 
right mastoid and apparently destroyed the auditory appa 
ratus as the patient was perfectly deaf on that side Another 
fragment of the 
 
pompom 
 
inflicted a severe flesh wound 
of the right arm The last case that struck me as of interest was 
an arteriovenous aneurysm of the right femoral artery and 
vein the bullet having entered the inside of the thigh and 
passing behind the femur emerged on the outside of the 
limb I thought the case a suitable one for operation 
Operating Room and Laboratory 
The operating theatre was built quite on the same lines as 
that at the Mooi River General Hospital and possessed all 
the essentials for successful operation work which was 
mainly undertaken by Major Porter RAMC The rray 
room adjoins the operating theatre and hard by are a wellfur 
furnished dispensary and a laboratory with every requisite for 
carrying out bacteriological research 
Dieting 
This is carried out on the same principle as in a large general 
hospital at home but more liberally 
 Brands essenc e 
Bovril champagne etc being freely issued at the discretion 
of medical officers The cooking staff is frequently tried to 
the utmost to provide all extras ordered such as custard 
puddings rice and sago puddings etc It must be re 
membered that each patient gets a separate pudding not a 
helping from a large one The dieting of patients con 
valescing from enteric fever is very carefully looked after and 
they get numerous extras and minced chicken after 14 days 
normal temperature  but frequently patients persuade their 
friends to give them solid food when nurses or orderlies are 
out of the wards and the consequences are relapses which are 
sometimes fatal 
Treatment of Enteric Fever 
No hardandfast rule was followed In bad cases of haemor 
rhage transfusion of a saline solution at a temperature of 
ioo F either into subcutaneous tissue over the abdomen 
lumbar regions or into the cephalic veins was employed with 
excellent results 
Widals test was carried out in the great majority of the 
cases also in doubtful ones It was found in certain cases of 
dysentery that enteric fever coexisted and that moreover as a 
patient convalesced from dysentery say from ten to fifteen 
days after admission symptoms of enteric appeared Careful 
records have been kept of cases inoculated and not inoculated 
against enteric fever It is impossible at present to give a 
decided opinion on the adequacy of its protection Un 
doubtedly many cases inoculated contracted the disease but 
as a rule the type was milder Unfortunately those who had 
been inoculated had unbounded confidence in its efficacy and 
consequently did not take as many precautions against con 
tracting the disease as they should 
Sanitation 
The water supply is from the town reservoirs and is filtered 
by means of the PasteurChamber land pressure filter and 
Berkefelds handpump filters 
The dry earth and pan system is in use for ordinary and 
convalescent patients the pans being emptied and cleaned 
out four or five times a day dusted with McDougalFs or 
chloride of lime powder There are two sanitary attendants 
in each latrine whose duty it is after a pan has been used to 
put in a little dry earth and chloride of lime or McDougalls 
powder thus disinfecting each stool Strong iron watertight 
carts remove the faecal matter and urine to deep pits some 
mile and a half off These pits are 10 feet deep and every 
morning the faecal matter of the day previous is covered with 
a layer of dry earth and chloride of lime 
Enteric stools and urine night stools and bedpans are kept 
outside the tents at one special corner the space occupied 
being sprinkled with chloride of lime every day When a 
bedpan is required the orderly on duty in the tent brings it to 
the patient first ascertaining that it is clean externally and 
internally On being used he replaces it outside the tent 
calling the conservancy man Indian sweeper who removes 
it to the special latrine set apart for enteric stools The 
contents are placed in a covered receptacle The bedpan is 
then washed in a i in 1000 solution of perchloride of mercury 
dried and a small quantity of izal i in 20 poured in just 
sufficient to cover the bottom 
The same process is carried out with urinals About 50 yards 
from the enteric stool shed is a large oblong shallow boiler 
placed on a brick furnace  into this boiler the enteric stools 
urine and disinfectants previously used are poured sawdust 
is mixed with the same fluid and the whole boiled until 
almost dry from evanoration  the contents are then shovelled 
out placed on the fire beneath and burnt a little petroleum 
being added Thus the whole faecal matter sawdust etc are 
turned into ashes There are 60 conservancy coolies a certain 
number being told off to each row of tents latrines lava 
tories etc 
The water used in the tents for the washing of patients etc is 
poured into pails kept in the same place as the bedpans 
nightstools etc and removed to sanitary pails on wheels also 
two large iron receptacles tiltcarts these when three 
quarters full are wheeled to deep tanks 500 yards from the 
camp and below it Outside the cookhouse and washhouses 
are large galvanised iron tanks capable of holding 100 gallons  
these are constantly being emptied by conservancy men Iy 
means of the large pails on wheels No water of any sort is 
allowed to run over into drains etc There are no drains in 
camp all fluid being removed to the tanks 
The tank principledevised I understand by Col McNeece 
is as follows Two large pits are dug out of the soil 40 by 
20 feet and 10 feet deep  these are connected by a pipe 4 feet 
from the top and at the lower end of the further one is a wire 
grating fixed in on the principle of a sluice which prevents 
any matter running into the drain which follows a devious 
course for 300 yards until the water is thoroughly clear  
it is then allowed to flow over the veld where it is absorbed 
in the course of 100 yards or less The principle of the tank 
is as follows  All slop water from tents washhouses cook 
house etc is poured into the first tank also all orange skins 
empty milk tins egg shells etc etc are put into the tank 
Each day a layer of earth is thrown in and the whole surface 
sprinkled with chloride of lime The capacity of the tank is 
about 1000 gallons it soon fills and the supernatant water 
flows into the second tank where it settles is sprinkled over 
with chloride of lime daily and when it reaches the level of 
the drain flows off As soon as the first tank is filled to within 
four feet of the top it is closed and filled up the other being 
filled up also and the same process again begun with fresh 
tanks 
Disposal of Enteric and Dysenteric Bed Linen and 
Clothing 
This is brought direct from the wards to the disinfecting 
shed All linen soiled with faeces or blood is first washed in a 
solution of izal and water then boiled in a similar solution 
and then placed in Threshs steam portable disinfect or as is 
all linen and clothing used in enteric tents It is then dried 
and handed over to the washing contractor direct 
The impression left on me by all I saw at the Estcourt 
General Hospital was most favourable and the greatest credit 
is I think due to Colonel McNeece RAMC and the officers 
military and civil who are working under him for the unre 
mitting industry care and attention to the minutest details 
which has characterised their work by which they have 
succeeded in bring the hospital to its present state of high 
efficiency

MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN ST HELENA 
By Wilberforce J J Arnold BA MB BCh 
St Helena 
Not since the days of Napoleon has St Helena loomed so 
largely before the eyes of the world A brief sketch therefore 
of the medical aspects of the 
island in its present rle of 
military prison may be of in 
terest The staff appointed 
to look after the 2000 odd pri 
soners of war and 1000 Bri 
tish troops comprises two 
officers of the RAMC and 
three civil surgeons Two of 
the latter were appointed di 
rect from England  the third 
came in medical charge of the 
prisoners on board the Mil 
waukee and has remained on 
the island The Senior Medi 
cal Officer Major Mosse 
RAMC had a task of no 
little difficulty in organising 
the hospital arrangements to 
meet the sudden influx of so 
many sick among the pri 
soners The great difficulty 
at first was the transport ser 
vice which was lamentably 
deficient the island being al 
most totally wanting in the 
means of coping with the 
large quantity of medical and 
other stores which had been 
discharged from ships in pro 
fusion on the wharf This 
difficulty had to be met by the 
importation of a large number of mules waggons and 
native drivers from the Cape 
The personnel of the Hospital Corps was largely made up of 
recruits of a few months training who naturally could not 
be expected to understand their duties perfectly The 
obstacles in the way of efficient nursing and the carrying out 
of orders generally will be obvious to anyone acquainted 
with the hospital orderly even in his finished condition 
The tact patience and administrative ability shown by the 
Senior Medical Officer however rapidly brought everything 
into smooth working order 
It was at first intended by the military authorities to estab 
lish a field hospital at Dead wood Plain where the Boer enclo 
sure is and marquees had been sent out for that purpose 
Acting on the advice of the Senior Medical Officer who deemed 
the site unsuitable for a marquee hospital owing to the long 
continuance of heavy rains during the wet season the situa 
tion was changed to Jamestown The block of buildings there 
which has been transformed into the Boer hospital was for 
merly the officers quarters of the 3rd West India Regiment 
and is admirably suited for its purpose the supply of light 
and air being abundant The British Government has sent 
out the complete equipment for a field hospital of 100 beds 
Everything has been furnished on a generous scale and cer 
tainly the prisoners have nothing to complain of in the 
measures that have been taken to provide for the needs of 
their sick It fortunately has not been necessary as yet to 
put all these beds into occupation 
On the first arrival of the Boers the numbers admitted to 
hospital were considerable There were numerous cases of 
typhoid and dysentery and large numbers of patients suffer 
ing from bronchial affections All the prisoners both in and 
out of hospital bore evident traces of the privations and hard 
ships of war  but as a result of two months stay on the island 
the amount of sickness has greatly decreased and the mass of 
the prisoners look in splendid condition At the Boer Hos 
pital Civil Surgeon Roe is doing duty and I am myself on 
duty at the Station Hospital The latter is now reserved 
exclusively for the troops though at first the prisoners 
shared some of the beds before their own hospital 
could be got ready It is a square building at the 
head of the town and is arranged for 28 beds but this 
accommodation is supplemented by a marquee in the hospital 
precincts so that admission can now be granted to 44 patients 
Numerous cases of dysentery and several of enteric fever 
occurred amongst the troops especially those whose duties lay 
in the immediate vicinity of the Boer encampment At an 
early stage of their stay on 
the island the condition of 
the prisoners enclosure gave 
rise to some anxiety owing to 
the objectionable habits of 
the motley crowd composing 
the prisoners including be 
sides Boers French German 
Irish Portuguese Italians 
Scandinavians and others 
who especially at night ne 
glected to use the trenches 
and otherconveniences The 
place in consequence became 
dangerously unwholesome 
Stringent measures were 
quickly taken to correct this 
and now the sanitary condi 
tion of the camp is all that 
could be desired 
The site of the Boer en 
campment is an1 ideally 
healthy one It is dist nt 
about six miles from James 
town and occupies a grassy 
plateau reached by a steep 
and circuitous road 1700 feet 
above the sea whose blue ex 
panse is spread below and 
over which the fresh wind 
constantly sweeps The only 
drawback to the position as a 
hospital site in the abstract is the heavy rainfll that often 
occurs at this time of the year but the wind and sunshine 
exert wonderful drying properties and so far the rains have 
produced no injurious results The present season so far has 
been remarkable for its small rainfall and abundant sun 
shine 
Jamestown which lies near the sea level closely shut in a 
narrow valley has just been visited by a very severe epidemic 
of influenza in which fully 70 per cent of the cases were com 
plicated with pneumonia and that with few exceptions of 
the lobar type The deathrate amongst the natives of St 
Helena has been unprecedented Although Deadwood Camp 
during the time of the epidemic was in daily communication 
with the town yet no case of any severity occurred amongst 
the prisoners  in fact the ordinary amount of sickness was 
not appreciably augmented This fact says much for the 
healthiness of their surroundings and should remove from 
their friends in South Africa any concern as to the nature of 
the climate about which so many erroneous reports were cir 
culated Major Austin RAMC is in medical charge at 
Deadwood and is assisted by Civil Surgeon Price whose rao e 
especial duty is the medical care of the prisoners Major

SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS 
SCOTTISH HOSPITAL KROONSTADT 
Dr Robert Stirling writing under date July 27th has sent 
us the following notes of the surroundings and work of the 
Scottish Hospital Kroonstadt 
As there was very little to do surgically and our staff of 
medical officers much more than sufficient I came on to the 
Simmer and Jack Hospital Germiston Johannesburg on loan 
from the Scottish till the authorities can send up a staff to 
work it consequently I am not in a position to say much re 
garding the recent work of the Scottish Hospital nor have I 
access at present to past records 
The site of the hospital is excellenton sloping ground 
near the railway station but outside the town The water 
supply is abundant obtained from the town supply by tapping 
the main which skirts the eastern boundary of the camp 
The doublelined tortoise tents have proved most satis 
factory and the Docker huts are very comfortable Despite 
the ingenious packing and light materials of the latter how 
ever the size and weight of the cases will probably prevent 
the use of the Docker hut except in base hospitals The 
equipment of the hospital is all that could be desired and is 
quite equal to that of our civil hospital so far as essentials are 
concerned The climate in the month of June and early July 
was delightful if one can stand cold nights The temperature 
frequently fell below freezing point inside the tents at night 
and those who dared the morning tub had to break the ice 
During the day we had ten hours usually of continuous sun 
shine allowing free opening of tents and much sitting out of 
convalescent patients  indeed the sick in beds were occa 
sionally taken out into the sun with great benefit Through 
the kindness of the commanding officers the bands of the 
Buffs and Oxfords and the Pipers of the 4th Argyll and 
Sutherland Highlanders frequently enlivened our afternoons 
in camp with music A large proportion of the cases were 
surgical The wounded came by train and bullock waggon 
from Honing Spruit Lindley and other places most fre 
quently semiconvalescent 
Many of the Mauser bullet wounds were remarkable from 
the absence of symptoms following the apparent penetration 
of important structures as inferred from the wounds of en 
trance and exit Such wounds required little treatment 
beyond the first dressing Shell wounds on the other hand 
from the bruising and sloughing of the soft parts and their 
infection from jagged ricocheting fragments were prone to 
suppurate Attempts to secure primary union of such wounds 
invariably failed so far as my observation went but all did 
well with free opening of the wound and drainage and anti 
septic irrigation Major operations were not numerous but 
amputations trephinings bullet extractions aided by the 
use of the x rays etc were all successfully performed while 
Mr Tuke successfully employed Murphys button in a case 
requiring the union of injured bowel 
The medical wards were mostly filled with cases of enteric 
fever dysentery rheumatism and debility Thanks to the 
energy of the Quartermasters department food was excellent 
and abundant and the cooking good 
Sisters and orderlies tackled their duties with zeal and 
good humour The combined efforts of all members of the 
staff and the excellence of the equipment have earned a very 
good reputation for the Scottish hospital The health of the 
staff could not be better 
THE LANGMAN HOSPITAL 
We are informed that the equipment of this hospital which 
is now at Pretoria has been doubled  the staff increased to 
seventyfive including ten sisters  and Mr Archie L Lang 
man Lieut Middlesex Yeomanry who has been acting as 
secretary and treasurer has been appointed by the authorities 
Military Officer in Charge to succeed Major Drury RAMC 
transferred to General Hospital Bloemfontein Mr G Gibbs 
and Mr H Scharlieb the senior medical officers who did such 
excellent work with the hospital in Bloemfontein are con 
tinuing their services at Pretoria 
SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS COMMISSION 
The South African Hospitals Commission which sailed for 
Capetown on August 4th resumed its labours immediately on 
arriving there on August 21st We are mainly indebted to 
the Times for the following reports of the evidence taken 
The first witness examined was Major MacMahon a volunteer 
surgeon attached to the Army Medical Reserve who was on 
duty in Bloemfontein for three months and who said the sani 
tary and other arrangements were satisfactory and there was 
an efficient supply of nurses No complaints had been made 
in Pretoria Early in July there was an abundance of food 
and a sufficient number of orderlies and nurses The hospitals 
at Johannesburg and Kroonstadt were well conducted Beds 
were commandeered from the town and medical officers were 
free to purchase requirements pending the arrival of supplies 
The Edinburgh Hospital at Norvals Pont and the Yeomanry 
Hospital at Deelfontein were perfect He advocated the use 
of field hospitals possessing independent transports The 
St John Ambulance men and volunteers rapidly got into 
their work At the base hospitals it was advisable to have 
more nurses The returns which the medical officers had to 
make were too numerous and bookwork should be delegated 
to clerks The sites of the general hospitals were selected by 
the Principal Medical Officer in consultation with the military 
authorities 
Woodstock Hospital 
On August 22nd the Commissioners visited Woodstock 
Colonel Williamson admitted that occasionally there were 
smells from the foreshore but denied that they had illeffects 
on the patients Miss Thomas nursing superintendent said 
she considered the hospital healthy and satisfactory The 
patients progressed remarkably well Twenty soldiers were 
also examined but they made practically no complaints ex 
cept in regard to a lack of orderlies and doctors 
Green Point and other Hospitals 
The Commissioners next inspected the hospital accommoda

were with General Carringtons force which went up to 
Rhodesia through Beira gave evidence to the effect that no 
proper provision was made for the sick at the camps on the 
march to Umtali but that the accommodation at that place 
was satisfactory 
On August 23rd the evidence given by the witnesses exam 
ined agreed that the management of the Woodstock Maitland 
and Green Point Hospitals was all that could be desired Dr 
Scholtz who was a physician at the Langman Hospital in 
Bloemfontein in April stated that he had found the hospital 
in an excellent condition There was no overcrowding There 
had indeed been a scarcity of fresh milk but the condensed 
milk supplied had answered admirably He had visited all 
the hospitals and had seen nothing to complain of nor had 
the patients complained to him He had also visited three 
hospitals at Kroonstadt where he found everything necessary 
being done for the patients At Pretoria undoubtedly there 
had been some difficulty in obtaining buildings for 
the accommodation of the sick and wounded and 
i there had also been difficulty in getting up supplies 
The number of orderlies was insufficient but he was 
not aware that there had been any deficiency of drugs 
The difficulty experienced in remedying any scarcity of such 
articles as blankets was due to redtapeism in the Medical 
Department whose rules were most arbitrary and superfluous 
The medical officers would have ordered such necessaries 
direct if they had had the power The classification of cases by 
the Royal Army Medical Corps could not be depended upon 
and if the doctors mentioned a case which was not in their 
classification the schedule was returned He expressed the
