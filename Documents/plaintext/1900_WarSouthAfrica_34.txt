SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY 
HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
BULLET INJURIES OF NERVE TRUNKS AND OF THE 
SPINAL CORD 
IN my last letter I mentioned that I had seen in the hospitals 
at Wynberg Cape Colony a number of interesting cases of 
bullet wounds in which nerve trunks had been injured and 
in this letter I propose to discuss these and also certain cases 
of injury of the spinal cord 
In most of the cases in which nerve trunks were injured by 
bullet wounds of the limbs the track of the bullet healed 
readily but when the patients were seen at Wynberg they 
were found with the limb partly or wholly paralysed over the 
area corresponding to the distribution of one or more of the 
nerve trunks Even when the symptoms appeared to indicate 
complete division of the nerve this was aftewards found not 
to be the case In some no doubt the division was complete 
and from the direction of the wound a large extent of the 
nerve must have been utterly destroyed But presumably 
in some the nerve trunk was merely grazed Such an injury 
however when inflicted by a bullet travelling at a very high 
velocity not only damages the nerve seriously but leads 
secondarily to changes of degeneration that ensue with great 
rapidity The pain usually is very severe in the limb and in 
proportion to the gravity of the wound as regards life these 
cases are distressing Yet they seemed hopeful and the 
symptoms varied with such rapidity that in not a few 
instances operations proposed were postponed on account of 
improvement There were few injuries in the hospital that 
will better repay careful watching at home The majority of 
these men will be invalided back to England the rule now in 
force being that no man unlikely to be fit for duty within two 
months is to be retained in hospital unless too ill to admit of 
removal 
INJURY OF MUSCULOSPIRAL NERVE 
A man in No 2 Hospital shot through the back of the arm 
at the level of the midpoint of the musculospiral groove had 
a marked zone of hyperaesthesia ansesthesia over the area 
supplied by the musculo spiral and paralysis of extensors 
The man was wounded about December ioth I899 but I am 
unable now to refer to the exact date The humerus was un 
injured The symptoms were held to be due to partialpos 
sibly totaldivision of the nerve below the level at which the 
nerve supply for the triceps comes off for this muscle could 
act The question of operative interference was raised but it 
was decided to wait and watch the development of the case 
A week later the condition had materially altered for the 
better Some power of extending the fingers returned almost 
suddenly according to the mans account The extensors of 
the forearm could be felt to contract but there was still 
marked wrist drop Supination was performed by the action 
of the biceps alone The hyperesthesia which had been a 
marked feature was notably diminished Pain which had 
been severe in the palm of the hand a phenomenon difficult 
of explanation but which seemed genuine and which I have 
noted in another case of the same sort was improved Alto 
gether the improvement was so decided that the question of 
operation was further postponed Ihe wound in this instance 
was at a right angle to the course of the nerve and as the 
bone appeared uninjured the actual damage to the trunk 
could hardly have been deep 
LESIONS OF DISTANT TISSUES IN PERFORATING WOUNDS OF 
LIMBS 
I have cited this case at some length as it is a fairly typical 
example of a rather common injury So far as present ex 
perience goes and it must be admitted that the experience is 
so short that one must speak very guardedly the main 
points of these cases appear to be three 
i The first is that the hyperaesthesia is very marked comes 
on early and alters rapidly 
2 The second is that profound nerve symptoms may occur 
without the nerve being severed 
These may be due to bruising or grazing of the nerve trunk 
but it would seem that they may even be present where the 
nerve is not touched at all The small bore projectile travel 
ling at high velocity drills a perfectly clean passage through 
the tissues often through bone but the effects are widely 
felt by the tissues Ecchymosis for instance often appears 
far from the bullet track in places where it is doubtful if the 
extravasated blood can possibly have extended Distant 
parts seem violently stretched by the passage of the bullet 
as the fascia of the thigh is often stretched in sprains of the 
ankle The bullet might therefore entail what the Germans 
call a violent Erschutterung of the nerve trunk by passing in 
its immediate vicinity without directly injuring the cord 
Thus in one case I saw the ulnar nerve carefully exposed in 
the lower part of the axilla in the hope of relieving symptoms 
of a similar nature to those described above The cicatricial 
track of the missile was seen but it did not affect the ulnar 
or any other of the nerve trunks nor was the ulnar nerve 
other than perfectly normal in appearance 
In another case a large nerve trunk was involved in the 
cicatricial track of a Mauser bullet which had perforated the 
ilium and judging by its direction had injured the nerve a 
little below the sciatic notch It may be observed incident 
ally that the almost undeviating4iraok of these bullets what 
ever the tissues they meet with renders the task of the sur 
geon to some extent easier The patient suffered extremely 
from pain along the course and distribution of the sciatic 
nerve The hyperaesthetic area was extensive and most 
marked In this case as in some others the tenderness of 
the tibia was marked There was foot drop The diagnosis 
made was bruising of the sciatic nerve and involvement in 
cicatricial tissue This diagnosis was borne out to the letter 
Some two inches below the exit of the nerve trunk it was found 
caught in cicatricial tissue as tough and dry as that following 
a burn This cicatricial tissue compressed the nerve and 
grooved it as a fibrous ring compresses a strangulated hernia 
All this tough material was dissected off and the nerve set 
free The immediate afterresults as regards the pain were 
satisfactory but the foot drop persisted and the greatly 
wasted flexor muscles of the thigh acted only in the feeblest 
manner The further progress of this case I hope to detail 
later 
3 The third noteworthy point in connection with these nerve 
cases is the astonishing power of recovery and the extent to 
which the diagnosis of the precise amount of injury may be 
mistaken 
BULLET WOUNDS OF THE SPINAL CORD 
In some degree injuries of the spinal cord present the 
same features as those of minor nerve trunks None of the 
cases in hospital seem more hopeless and none are on that 
very account more distressing than gunshot wounds involv 
ing the cord The most remarkable feature of these cases is 
the astonishing rapidity of the degenerative changes In a 
day or two in many instances deep sloughing sores have 
formed over the sacrum and others where there is not the 
slightest pressure Cystitis sets in early and in three or 
four weeks perhaps the patient has run through all the 
changes that in civil hospitals we see in traumatic cases 
accomplished only in months An intensely acute sharply 
limited zone of hyperaesthesia is a usual symptom The level 
of this varies almost from day to day If there is any grave 
lesion of the cord from a bullet or from the driving of frag 
ments of bone into the vertebral canal the wound may be 
set down as mortal as far as can be judged at 
present If the bullet has travelled down the long 
axis of the spine the amount of destruction is enor 
mous Even when the wound is transverse affecting 
but a small extent of the cord the area of damage may bevery 
great as the following case will show A private was wounded 
at Magersfontein the bullet a Mauser judging by the wounds 
entering the back about the level of the sixth dorsal spine 
about 4 inches to the side of the middle line and passing out 
transversely at a corresponding point on the other side Com 
plete paraplegia and loss of sensation ensued Sores rapidly 
formed over the sacrum and elsewhere and the man died 
some three weeks after the injury all the usual trophic 
changes have succeeded one another with great rapidity The

bullet wounds healed kindly As the Mauser bullets seldom 
or never deflect it is possible to judge very closely of the 
structures likely to be injured At times it may be remarked 
the most difficult but still straightforward problems of sur 
gical anatomy confront the surgeon In this case it seemed 
impossible that the bullet could have done more than skirt 
the back of the vertebral canal and the symptoms were 
therefore attributed either to haimorrhage compressing the 
cord a graze of the cord or injury from fragments of bone 
The condition of the patient rendered the idea of operation 
hopeless At the postmortem examination the laminae of the 
dorsal vertebra were found fractured A mass of finely com 
minuted bone the size of a large pea was driven into it but 
did not perforate the dura mater Some of the fragments of 
bone were exceedingly sharp and seemed to pin the meningzes 
to the cord The membranes were adherent over an area the 
size of a shilling and extremely congested over an area the 
size of a fiveshilling piece As soon as the loose pieces of 
bone were removed the compressed cord rose up and save for 
the area of congestion looked normal On slitting up the 
membranes however some three inches of the cord below 
the site of compression was found reduced to a complete pulp 
entirely disintegrated and diffluent No other injury was 
found 
No case could have seemed more promising for operation 
With the utmost ease the comminuted bone compressing the 
cord could have been removed and the operator would doubt 
less have congratulated himself on a probable success 
Operation however would not it was evident have done the 
slightest good even though it had been performed immedi 
ately after the receipt of the injury The wound was mortal 
from the first The condition of the cord was almost certainly 
due to the immediate consequences of the injury and not to 
any secondary degenerative changes These might have been 
possibly stayed by operative interference but the ultimate 
issue would have been the same and probably life would not 
have been in the least degree prolonged or rendered less 
painful 
The case is a fairly typical one When the cord is actually 
traversed and a portion injured in its long axis or grazed the 
prognosis is of the gravest nature In some instances where 
the bullets have passed close to the cord symptoms similar to 
actual lesion show at once but after a whilea few days 
perhapssome sensation returns or some little power of move 
ment is noticed Such cases are difficult of explanation 
Extravasation of blood into the canal may be the cause but it 
is more than doubtful whether this common explanation is 
often the true one Similar symptoms as already mentioned 
occur when the bullets travel near nerve trunks in which dis 
secting operations have revealed no nakedeye changes 
To attribute the symptoms in these cases in which the cord 
or the large nerve trunks are not actually implicated to 
 nerve shock is really rather to beg the question Terms 
of this nature do not really either advance knowledge or 
assist in treatment However great the velocity of the 
bullet as it traverses the tissues and however clearly it may 
appear to perforate the structures there is yet good evidence 
that remote structures may be violently stretched or lacerated 
Extravasations are often seen at points rQmote from the line 
of the bullet wound which are niot to be explained by the 
trackingof thebloodextravasatedabouttheinjury The nerve 
shock  is more probably as in the case of the nerve trunks 
essentially due to a direct  commotion or  Erschutterung 
Possibly it may be said that  shock is quite as good and 
scientific a term as those given I will yield the point at 
once if it be allowed that the symptoms are actually produced 
by mechanical injury The term  shock  is so often 
employed to explain conditions in which it is assumed that 
the changes are physiological rather than anatomical that I 
desire to avoid it It is perhaps still too theoretical to 
assume that the passage of the projectile through the tissues 
in the close neighbourhood of important structures such as 
spinal cord or large nerve trunks produces vibratory effects 
sufficient to account for their disorganisation but certainly 
such an hypothesis furnishes a fairly satisfactory explanation 
of the effects actually observed 
A case bearing out the above remarks now in the hospital 
at Maritzburg may be briefly cited The bullet a Mauser 
entered 2 inches below the acromion process of the left shoulder 
at the posterior border of the deltoid There was no exit 
wound There was from the first complete paralysis of move 
ment of both lower limbs The probable direction of the bullet 
was towards the dorEolumbar spine but the condition of the 
man precluded skiagraphy There had been no hiemoptysis 
and the resonance on the left side was natural so that in all 
probability there was no wound of the pleural cavity or lung 
The wound was received at Colenso on December 15th 1859 
The condition on January ioth was as follows There was no 
power of movement whatever in either leg The reflexes wele 
absent The abdominal muscles moved normally in respira 
tion As regards sensation Over the skin area supplied by 
the anterior crural trunk sensation was impaired but not 
absent Over that supplied by the small sciatic it was 
normal Over that supplied by the great sciatic it was much 
impaired and in places hypersesthetic Sensation over the 
distribution of the geniocrural nerve was normal There was 
extreme tenderness of the left testis but the gland itself was 
normal Sensation over the abdomen was natural There was 
a sharplylimited band of hypersesthesia at the level of the 
ensiform cartilaae Above and below this the sensation was 
normal The skin over the sacrum was red and a sore was 
threatened but there were no sores elsewhere Control of 
bladder was almost complete but some cystitis had begun 
There was constipation There was no evidence of fracture of 
the spine 
It is of course possible that in this instance one or more of 
the vertebrie had been broken up to some extent but it seems 
impossible that the cord was directly injured by the bullet 
Yet the symptoms were bilateral There was no indication of 
progressive myelitis The mans condition generally was bad 
and the case seemed likely to drift slowly to a fatal issue 
In one or two other cases in which the bullet had passed 
close to the cord the symptoms of actual lesion were present 
for a time but then rapidly altered for the better and there 
was a fair prospect of recovery CLINTON T DENT

IICLINICAL SIGNS AND COURSE OF THE WOUNDS 
THRE actual infliction of the wound gives rise to little pain 
usually a sharp burning sensationand is followed by 
remarkably little shock severe shock is in fact uncommon 
even when vital organs are struck Omitting the cases in 
which a large vascular trunk is struck in a limb or in the 
body external hsemorrhage is slight and even when a 
large trunk is implicated it more often gives rise to inter 
mediate or secondary hoemorrhage than to severe primary 
bleeding In fact such evidence as can be obtained points 
to but few deaths taking place on the field from primary 
bleeding Although however external haemorrhage is slight 
interstitial bleeding into the limbs or into the cavities of the 
trunk during the first few hours after the injury is common 
and may be severe or fatal As will be remarked later trau 
matic aneurysms are comparatively frequent Again the 
scoring or contusion of nerve trunks gives rise to more or 
less complete paralysis or to severe neuralgic pain during and 
after the healing of the wound 
The tendency to run an aseptic course is very marked and 
deep suppuration or diffuse cellulitis is distinctly rare This 
depends on the smallness of the wound the aseptic nature of 
tlle bullet and the fact that foreign bodies such as pieces of 
clothing are comparatively rarely introduced 
The asepticity of the bullet is I think clearly demonstrated 
and is probably due to the fact that the bullet in travelling 
through the barrel of the rifle obtains a completely fresh 
surface and with such enters the body As to the frequency 
with which portions of clothing are carried into the wound it 
should be remarked that this varies considerably with the 
nature of the material traversed The opening in the khaki 
jacket for instance from the hardness of the material is 
usually a clean slit but if the bullet has to traverse a flannel 
shirt loss of substance and transference of this to the wound is 
more common while in the case of the highland kilt where 


408 TMLJQBJ7 MILITARY hIOSPITALS IN NATAL F3B 17 1900 
several layers of cloth have to be traversed portions are com 
paratively frequently found in the wounds 
The slight tendency to suppuration exhibited by the tracks 
is however I think due to some inherent character of the 
tissue probably explained by the condensation and surface 
destruction of the tissue resulting from the force and velocity 
of the bullet since the tracks neither bleed freely at first nor 
do they furnish any material amount of serous discharge dur 
ing the process of healing They remain indeed dry 
throughout and their slight tendency to suppuration is well 
instanced by the fact that if for any reason a deep part of a 
track becomes infected and suppurates the inflammatory pro 
cess shows no tendency to spread by the original wound but 
comes to the surface locally 
During the process of healing the apertures and with them 
the track gradually contract the aperture of entry is closed by 
dry clot and diminishes in size the contused margin becom 
ing a small black depressed spot in the centre while the 
aperture of exit often closes with an ordinary reddened cica 
trix When fully healed the ends of the contracted 
track can be felt as two small indurated spots often so 
hard as to give the impression of an included foreign body 
The extreme density of the resulting cicatrix in the deeper 
paits of the wound is a factor of much importance since if it 
involves tendons or nerves considerable impairment of 
movement or signs of nerve pressure are produced Again 
a track through the muscles of the leg for instance will more 
or less tie the whole thickness of the traversed structures 
together from the aperture of entry to that of exit both of 
which may be seen to be drawn in as dimples when the muscles 
are put in action This condition naturally gives rise to 
much subsequent stiffness and pain on movement and forms 
one of the most troublesome afterconsequences in simple 
flesh wounds The scars left in the situation of the two aper 
tures are not more apparent than those resulting from a large 
acne pustule 
The above description of uncomplicated flesh wounds shows 
that the treatment of these injuries is simple in the extreme 
It has consisted almost entirely in the application of pads of 
dry bicyanide gauze and a little wool after the parts 
surrounding the openings have been washed with an 
antiseptic lotion either a solution of carbolic acid 
or of perchloride of mercury Fixation beyond that result 
ing from the bandaging on of the dressing has rarely been 
needed In the foregoing remarks concerning the aseptic 
course of the wounds considerable stress has been laid on the 
aseptic character of the bullet and the nature of the injury to 
the soft parts but I should not neglect to add that the purity 
of the atmosphere and the apparently innocuous nature of the 
dust on the high veld when the camp is a fresh one must 
also be credited as important factors in the happy results 
which have been attained up to the present It will be noted 
that no remark has been made as to the treatment of retained 
bullets and this for two reasons first retained Mauser bullets 
are uncommon and secondly if not causing trouble they 
are best left alone unless they lie in very superficial posi 
tions

THE MILITARY HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL SHIPS 
IN NATAL 
SUSPENSE  
HERE in Natal we have been living for some time past in 
almost daily expectation of hearing of severe fighting up at 
the front and of a fresh influx of wounded The suspense has 
been so long however and the scanty amount of news so try 
ing that already some degree of mental reaction is apparent 
Today comes the information apparently well authenticated 
that the relief forces have crossed the Tugela and the long 
expected engagement cannot now be far distant Nearly all 
the men wounded at Colenso who have been under treatment 
in hospital here have been moved away and the hospitals are 
fairly empty 
THE HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION IN NATAL 
The opportunity is therefore a good one for reviewing the 
hospital accommodation in Natal and considering how far it 
is adequate to meet an emergency that has long been foreseen 
GENERAL HOSPITAL AT MooI RIVER 
No 4 General Hospital is now established at Mooi river 
distant by rail some two or three hours from this place It 
is of course a tent hospital similar in all respects to Nos 2 
and 3 at Wynberg and Rondebosch near Capetown Fully 
500 patients can be accommodated 
TEE BARRACK HOSPITALS AT PIETERMARITZBURG 
The main hoapitals in Maritzburg are the barrack buildings 
at Fort Napier and are two in number containing beds for 
about 6oo cases At the moment of writing 400 of these beds 
are empty They are placed on sloping ground well above 
the town The wards are the usual type of barramk hut with 
the invariable verandah or  stoep  running along the whole 
length in the lower aspect Eaeh ward contains about 25 
beds rather too large a number Many of the huts are old 
and have the usual disadvantages of modern buildings that 
have been in use for some time The floors are hardly perfect 
and the visitoraccustomed to the glazed bricks the marble 
and the tiles of modern civilian hospitalswould find much 
to criticise and perhaps much to be surprised at as regards 
the eminently satisfactory progress of wounds and operation 
cases under treatment in them The huts burnt down on 
January ioth have been rapidly rebuilt and are already nearly 
complete 
THE CHURCH AND LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HOSPITALS 
The garrison church has been cleared and it is intended to 
use itif necessity arisesas a hospital ward The floor 
space will allow of 36 to 40 beds This building is lofty and 
being of brick has the great advantage of being 
cool a feature of no little value in the treatment 
of the sick and wounded in a hot climate The 
temperature in the town for some days past has during the 
day averaged over 8o0 F But the fact is that a church does 
not make a very good hospital The church is rather dark 
and the amount of window quite insufficient Moreover in 
each light only about onethird of the window can be opened 
All the patients are unnecessarily congregated in one ward 
and however continuously the doors are kept open the air is 
likely to be stagnant in the corners Probably the milder 
cases especially such as are not confined to bed will be rele 
gated to the Church Hospital In the centre of the town the 
fine and lofty building of the Legislative Assembly has been 
converted into a hospital for the Volunteers and is excellently 
Euited for the purpose The sole objection that can be urged 
against it Is that the number of patients in the main ward is 
too large The liospital fittings are excellent The bedsteads 
have wirewove mattresses those of the Fort and Lower 
Barrack Hospitals are of sacking and the whole place has the 
right stamp of neatness and goodorder upon it Thecolonists 
of Natal have evidently determined to do the thing 
thoroughly well and they have succeeded This building is 
fitted with electric light The church has the same advan 
tage 
On the slope of a hill just outside the town overlooking the 
Park are the tents of the College Hospital similar to the 
other tent hospitals There is ample space and the number 
of beds could be almost indefinitely increased but it is to be 
feared that there would be difficulty in providing a propor 
tionate increase in the medical and the nursing staff 
THE SPIRIT OF THE COLONISTS 
In addition to these hospitals the two ships now at Durban 
must be reckoned The Lismore Castle furnishes a very re 
markable instance of the energy of the people of Natal and of 
the Durban workmen in particular In four days andahalf 
the vessel was entirely converted from a transportfor troops to a 
floating hospital The old fittings had to be removed and the 
entire ship practically rearranged The swing and fixed cots 
were made and put in place dressers set up and operating 
theatre constructed between decks the electric lighting 
altered ventilation arrangements modified and a thousand 
other minor details considered and completed in this astonish 
ingly short time Two things were necessary for so successful 
a piece of work One was an energetic chief with a power of 
organisation This requisite was more than fully supplied by 
Captain Holland of the Indian Marine Secondly the men 
entrusted with the actual work had to set to their task with 


Fun 17 19o0a MEDICAL NOTES FROM CAPETOWN m 409 
real keenness and with a spirit that is not to be called up by 
mere offer of increased wages Fortunately this spirit is just 
now very conspicuous in Natal Nothing is more striking to 
the stranger thrown for the first time into this colony during 
the stress of a crisis like the present than the extraordinary 
spirit of loyalty and determination shown by the inhabitants 
It is shown by the eagerness with which men enlist it may 
be hown by the sacrifices of every kind which everyone seems 
ready to make and it may be shown by the carpenter or 
plumber or other workman who does his very best and works 
continuously his very hardest at anything connected with the 
welfare or advantage of the troops Natal so far has had to 
bear the brunt of the campaign and the people of Natal so far 
as a casual visitor is enabled to judge have faced the music 
in a spirit worthy of a great race They have not been demon 
strative they do not wave flags or sing borrowed sentiments 
but they have put their shoulders to the wheel and high and 
low shown a grim determination to look their misfortunes in 
the face to bear trouble and loss with equanimity and to bide 
their time with patiencewith obstinacy if the term be pre 
ferredtill the issues are resolved Such a colony must go far 
and it is to be hoped that their patriotism will be fully ap 
preciated From this digression which is less of a divaga 
tion than it may appear I may return to the hospital ship 
THE HOSPITAL SHIPS 
In the Lismore Castle the ventilation seemed adequate if 
not quite as free as could be wished But the ship was 
moored to the wharf in the channel as far up the bay as it 
could possibly be got The rise and fall of the tide sweeping 
strongly along the narrow channel carried I was assured all 
the drainage well out to seaa satisfactory condition of affairs 
from the sanitary point of view though rather unexpected 
Access however to ships moored beyond the bar in the outer 
anchorage is dificult and the sea at times runs uncomfortably 
high The Lismore Castle accommodates 250 patients Here 
again there were too many beds in one ward the forward one 
having 56 cots It was satisfactory to find that some of the 
trained nurses who had been thrown out of work by having to 
leave Johannesburg had found employment in the ship Dr 
Brodie of Johannesburg was in chief medical charge with a 
staff of civil Burgeons 
The Lismore Castle seems now to occupy a rather indefinite 
position The beds are no longer to be reckoned as part of 
the general hospital here The reason for this change which 
has been made within the last few hours I have not yet been 
able to ascertain Possibly the ship is to be used for the 
transport of sick a duty for which it is not nearly so well 
adapted as the Nubia The latter ship has a reputation for 
steadiness in a sea which her breadth of beam would seem to 
indicate I hope it is no libel on the shipping companies to 
hiiit that however carefully their vessels are designed some 
roll more than others and that a ship that rolls badlyis never 
well suited to be a hospital ship This consideration does not 
seem always to have been kept in view 
Orders were given to fit the P and 0 steamship Nubia as a 
hospital ship on December 26th When I visited the ship on 
January sth the work was all but complete Allowing for the 
season of the year the rapidity of this work was as creditable 
as in the case of the Lismore Castle Through the courtesy of 
Captain Henning RNR and of Captain Holland who was 
in charge during the alterations I was enabled to make a very 
thorough inspection It could hardly have been possible to 
select a ship more admirably adapted for the purpose than the 
Nubia and it may reasonably be questioned whether there is 
a better hospital ship out here Probably no ships have been 
fitted up at less cost but real efficiency has not on that ac 
count been sacrificed The ingenuity of the naval man is ap 
parent at every turn Thus I noticed that glass storage 
cells of an accumulated battery had been utilised as re 
ceptacles for the inevitable perchloride of mercury solution 
in the wards The nonprofessional visitor seeking make 
shift contrivances of the sort might have drawn unfavour 
able comparisons being impressed by the elaboration of 
costly detail in the sumptuous ships fitted out in England 
but the medical man would ask for no better place to treat 
sick and wounded than the Nubia The ventilation is 
admirable and depends but little on special contrivances 
such as electric fans though in every ward two fans were 
fixed which could at will be used as electric punkahs The 
whole of the air in any ward too could be renovated when 
ever desired by an exhaust arrangement By opening the 
watertight doors a passage right fore and aft can be secured 
The NWubia could accommodate about 470 patients 300 of 
these being convalescent and provided with hammocks The 
number of cots in the wards varied from 32 to 20 There were 
136 cots 6o of these being swinging ten of these screened 
of by hanging curtains were for officers who could also be 
accommodated in the ordinary staterooms 
Provision had been made for septic cases which could be 
practically isolated in certain of the staterooms provided 
with their own bathrooms Finally the Nubia has the 
advantage of abundant deck space a luxury rather apt to 
be curtailed in the most modern liners 
Colonel Hodder RAMC is in medical command with 
a staff of civil surgeons The nursing staff consisted of 7 
sistersfar too small a number seeing that i or 2 would be 
required for night duty 
To the list of available hospital beds already enumerated 
should be added 50 in Grays Hospital the civil hospital in 
Maritzburg 
SUMMARY OF BASE HosPITAL AcCOMMODATION IN NATAL 
All told therefore the number of hospital beds available 
now inNatal is rather under 3ooo not at alltoo large a num 
ber for it is to be feared that if Ladysmith is relieved a large 
number of sick will be brought and it seems almost hopeless 
to suppose that the relief can be effected without the hospital 
resources being fully taxed to find place for the wounded 
At present convalescent patients are sent down to Durban 
and lodged in the hospital ships until moved into Capetown 
or back to the front A large number of these cases require 
the very slightest medical treatment and the available beds 
are therefore occupied to the exclusion of any fresh cases that 
may come down Great relief would be given by the estab 
lishment of a tent convalescent hospital at Durban and few 
more suitable places could be foundthan thehigh ground be

THE BASE HOSPITALS IN CAPE COLONY 
THERE has been a temporary lull in the arrival of wounded 
from Lord Methuens column but the hospitals are very full 
all the same and even with the Portland Hospital the accom 
modation will be in no way in excess of the certain demands 
that will be made even allowing for the fact that invalids and 
convalescents are being steadily sent off to England Advan 
tage has been taken of these latter drafts to transfer some of 
the patients from the Capetown Station Hospital to the 
General Hospital at Wynberg The Station Hospital was be 
coming inconveniently crowded It and two nondieted 
station hospitals at Green Point and Maitland respectively 
have to provide for all the medical needs of the base which 
are considerable Owing to political exigencies it is im 
possible to denude Capetown of troops whilst the heavy staff 
employed in Army Service and other administrative duties 
have to be provided for 
SICK FROM THE TRANSPORTS 
But the greatest demand upon the station hospital comes 
from the transports arriving from home Every vessel lands 
a somewhat ominous number of sick many of whom are not 
likely to convalesce in time for this war and if the ratio is 
kept up by the Seventh and Eighth Divisions some external 
additional accommodation will be reciuired The vast majority 
of the cases landed from the transports are venereal For 
this of course no one can be blamed except the faddists who 
have only too successfully cried down the Contagious 
Diseases Acts The reasons why a large number of cases of 
this class should appear on an outward voyage and be in full 
swing on arrival at the port of destination are obvious Yet 
in some cases there appears to have been some lack of due 
precautions taken at home I have seen quite a number of 
cases landed here with secondary symptoms at a stage show

ing that the probable consequences of the primary sore can 
hardly have been sufficiently considered Then again in 
the case of reserve men and the militia some cases of men 
suffering from chronic neglected gonorrhoea not gleet but 
profuse purulent discharge reported to have lasted for weeks 
or months have been landed here and sent to the hospital 
without doubt to be returned without going near the fighting 
line Very wisely an order has been issued that all men not 
likely to be fully fit for duty within two months are to be 
invalided home Now it is hardly probable that a case of 
secondary syphilis in an early stage or a case of chronic 
neglected gonorrhoea such as I have mentioned can be fit for 
campaigning in that time Net result the expense of bring 
ing a man out maintaining him at Capetown and sending 
him back again Of tertiary manifestations not many are in 
hospital but one class of case causing very much trouble are 
those with indolent enlargement of the inguinal glands which 
appear to be very obstinate dragging on for weeks in spite of 
potassium iodide internally and all varieties of local treat 
ment A notable fact is the number of cases of pneumonia 
landed from the transports mostly at a stage showing that 
the disease appeared in the warmer latitudes These as a 
rule do fairly well when once landed but one of the trans 
ports just arrived had seven deaths from this cause during the 
voyage A large number of cases of influenza appear to occur 
on the transports They are mostly in the convalescing stage 
when landed but very weak and take a long time to build up 
for service fitness Of scarlet fever only one case has been 
landed for weeks No spread of this affection really has 
occurred 
CONVALESCENTS FROM THE EASTERN DISTRICTS 
Another cause of pressure upon the Station Hospital here 
has been the sending of a number of convalescents from Port 
Elizabeth to Capetown for the benefit of the more bracing 
climate of the Cape Peninsula as it has been found 
impossible to get a complete return to health in the summer 
climate of the Eastern districts As the war goes on it 
becemes more and more evident that the Cape Peninsula 
should be the sole sick base The enervating climate of the 
Eastern Ports is very detrimental at this time of year and 
the difficulty in procuring fresh vegetables milk fruit 
and the like up country militate very strongly against the 
utilisation of inland towns for this purpose This is especially 
so on the Western line 
MEDICAL CASES 
Of the medical cases at the Station Hospital the most 
serious appear to be pneumonia and dysenteric diarrhoea 
Cases of typhoid fever have not been particularly numerous 
either in the Station or general hospitals 
THE SITUATION AND STAFF OF THE CAPETOWN STATION 
HOSPITAL 
This hospital is badly situated on a ilat stretch of beach close 
to the city and wedged in between the sea and the railway line 
The fact that the railway has to be crossed renders it some 
what difficult of access Moreover the foreshore is not of the 
cleanest and the Town Council in its wisdom has constructed 
the city sewage outfall in the immediate neighbourhood 
Anda great disadvantage where tent accommodation has to be 
largely resorted toit lies in the teeth of the prevalent south 
east winds which churn up clouds of dust often compel the 
keeping down of tent flaps all day and at times wreck the 
tents The building itself is an old double storey one but 
fairly well constructed and ventilated It has two wings and 
an administrative block in the centre Each wing contains 
two wards of twenty beds eachone upstairs one down 
There are besides smaller wards for ophthalmic cases infec 
tious diseases and for immunity and observation purposes 
making up a total normal accommodation of somewhat over a 
hundred beds But this has been supplemented by the utili 
sation of sundry corridors and small rooms and by the erec 
tion of fourteen marquees and bell tents in the yards and on 
the ground between the hospital and the sea so that at present 
about 250 patients are in the hospital 
The institution is extremely well managed and the patients 
on the whole very comfortable although as I mentioned 
before the Cape doctor at times almost renders the 
marquees untenable The medical officer in charge is Major 
Tube RAMC a most courteous and attentive officer who 
appears to have secured the goodwill of his subordinates in a 
remarkable manner The sanitation is as good as it can 
possibly be considering the situation of the hospital The 
staff consists at present besides the commissioned officer of 
4 civil surgeons locally engaged One of these is entirely 
occupied with outside work A civil surgeon from England 
joined a couple of days ago but has now been ordered to 
Natal so that for weeks the wards and marquees have been 
under the care of 3 medical officersnot at all too many con 
sidering the continuous toandfro transfers that are taking 
place Captain Connor RAMC an officer properly be 
longing to medical store work is quartered on the place and 
although he does not take charge of any beds relieves the 
staff of certain miscellaneous duties and takes his share as 
orderly medical officer The newlyarrived civil surgeom 
mentioned above is Dr Martin a former housesurgeon to 
Mr Dent at St 3eorges The remainder of the last batch 
of I6 civil surgeons have been posted to the general hospitals 
This hospital has no accommodation for officers but one or 
two are occasionally taken in The dietary is excellent 
This applies to all the hospitals and it is only fair to mention 
that absolutely no restrictions are placed upon any of the 
staffs in the way of ordering extras There need be no 
anxiety whatever at home as regards both officers and men 
being fed to the fullest extent which the medical officers con 
sider suitable I have carefully inquired into this and am 
satisfied upon the point The dietary in all the hospitals is 
indeed far more liberal than it would be at the average civil 
hospital in the colony Apropos of diet it is to be hoped that 
military rules will obtain at the portion of the Claremont 
Sanatorium which is being used as a hospital for convalescent 
officers under the charge of the Superintendent who has 
been engaged for that purpose as a civil surgeon His creed 
and that of the institution under normal conditions is strict 
nonalcoholic nonnicotine vegetarianism The relaxation of 
this regimen is due to the fact of the sanatorium being for 
the nonce a military hospital not to the military hospital 
being at the sanatorium 
NURSING 
The nursing at all the hospitals continues to beexcellently 
performed by the RAMC assisted by a few of the Cape 
Medical Staff Corps with of course at the general hospita s 
the cooperation of the army nursing sisters All aret of 
course very much overworked at times when large consign 
ments of wounded arrive This also applies to the medical 
staff and although both medical and narsing staffs are ample 
for normal conditions they certainly are somewhat insuffi 
cient for the preEsure caused by the arrival of train after train 
of wounded within a few hours It would be going too far 
however to expect the authorities to keep the personnel fully 
up to highpressure gauge involving as it would enforced 
idleness for long periods There has been a good deal of 
grumbling about the supposed mistake of the authorities in 
not largely employing Colonial female nurses at the base hos 
pitals and releasing RAMC people for the front Speaking 
purely as a civilian and a Colonial practitioner I cannot go 
altogether with this It is a great mistake to suppose that 
the ordinary civil nurse is fit for military work At the 
station base hospitals owing to the large preponderance of 
venereal cases it would obviously be impossible to employ 
them whilst even at the general hospitals there are great 
difficulties in the way Women submit far less kindly to 
discipline than men and the Colonial nursesalbeit many of 
them are most excellent womenhave in most cases never 
been under even the same discipline as that to which their 
British sisters have to submit The Colonial period of proba 
tion has hitherto been only twe years and only a limited 
number of women are registered even under that probation 
Moreover in the Transvaal there is no official regulation of 
nurses at all and a large number of the Johannesburg 
 nurses  have never had any proper training in their lives 
Moreover it is a matter of common repute and in saying this 
I make no reflection on the general body that to put the case 
mildly only too many of the nurses from the Golden City are 
not so staid as the requirements of military discipline de 
mand To avoid friction between Colonial nurses on the one 
hani and the RAMC and still more Army Nursing Sisters 
on the other would be a difficult task I know that the 


FIB 17 190  ACCOMMODATION FOR CONVALESCENTS AT MADEIRA W R8DICL LJONAL 411 
latter ladies hold this view and after many years of experi 
ence as a hospital administrator in the Colony I can endorse 
it Of course a few suitable Colonial nurses could be selected 
but the task of selection would be very difficult By far the 
better method would be to raise morebearer companies from 
Colonial men and leave the RAMC more at liberty for 
hospital work Numbers of good class young men manyof 
them St John pupils are available for the purpose and in a 
couple of weeks could be fitted for bearer work which requires 
far less training than ward duties I have noticed some com 
plaint somewhere as to lack of cooperation between the 
general hospitals I have carefully gone into this and do not 
think the complaint well founded Of course as each general 
hospital is a selfcontained unit a little unit esprit de corps 
call it jealousy  if you likemay come out in conversation 
at times But I am convinced that this never operates to the 
detriment of the service The Principal Medical Officer and 
the Principal Medical Officer of the Lines keep so constant a 
personal supervision over the general hospitals that I am 
certain no overlapping or clashing exists 
HEALTH OF THE TROOPs 
Apart from illness contracted at home or on the voyage the 
health of the troops at Capetown Maitland and Green Point 
has been remarkably good far better than that of the civil 
population around The contrast is particalarly notable as re 
gards enteric fever and influenza both of which affections are 
fairly rife in the city while very few have occurred amongst 
the military The health of Lord Methuens column has also 
been remarkably good very little medical illness beyond the 
usual limited number of rheumatic and dysenteric diarrhea 
cases beinig in evidence 
Whilst on this subject I may mention one deficiency upon 
which all the civil surgeons I have conversed with are 
emphaticthe very limibed range of drugs kept in the 
hospital dispensaries I do not mean to say that this is a 
local defect The available pharmacopeeia is so far as I can 
gather the aame as at other stations but it is limited and 
the civil surgeons complain about the consequent hamper 
ing of their prescribing One man told me that there 
was not a single intestinal antiseptic in his hospital dis 
pensary not even salol and that even so common a drug as 
citrate of potash was not in stock This is in strong contrast 
with the surgical equipment which as I have said before is 
very complete 
APPOINTMENTS 
Lieutenant Colonel Hodson in charge of one of the divisions 
in No I General Hospital and Major Sylvester Secretary to 
Colonel Stevenson have exchanged appointments the latter 
an enthusiastic surgeon being anxioue for clinical work 
Dr Hornabrook a civil surgeon in Natal has been greatly 
distinguishing himself at Ladysmith being hit no fewer than 
four times during the late assault by the Boers 
Another medical man Dr Fryer lately civil surgeon at the 
Station Hospital has relinquished the lancet for the sword 
having accepted a subalterns commission in the South 
African Light Horse 
Mr R E DrakeBrockman has been appointed medical 
officer of the newlyraised Railway Pioneer Regiment A 
gentleman with a German name but of doubtful nationality 
was appointed at first but on representation from the Intel 
ligence Department was for reasons entirely unconnected 
with professional status superseded 
The greatest care is necessary in making medical appoint 
ments both as regards officers and men as there is too much 
reason to believe that the Red Cross is sometimes used to 
cover widely different objects 
A medical store dep6t has been established at Capetown in 
charge of Major Tyacke RAMC 
SICKNESS AT KiMBERLEY 
Kimberley is suffering great straits during the siege The 
deathrate for December for children under i year reached the 
appalling figures offor whites 67II and for coloured 9I2I per 
Iooo per annum The adult rate was 6o for whites and 138 
for coloured The causes of death are mostly in children 
 marasmus and gastroenteric catarrh and adults scurvy 
both of course due to want of milk vegetables and proper 
food generally The adult rations have been reduced to T lb 
of meat daily of which horse flesh constitutes threefourths 
Curiously enough under the conditions enteric cases have 
done well only 3 deaths out of 52 cases occurring during the 
month These figures are from Dr Stoneys report The Red 
Cross machinery is working extremely well and comforts of 
all kinds are being plentifully supplied to Methuens and 
Frenchs columns As yet Colonel Young has not been able 
to deal personally with Gatacres column although much is 
being done locally for that section of the forces 
ACCOMMODATION FOR CONVALESCENTS AT 
MADEIRA 
WE have received from Dr Michael Grabham FRCP of 
Madeira for the following account of the arrangements made 
or in contemplation at Madeira for the reception of sick and 
wounded from South Africa 
Several villas standing in spacious grounds have been 
offered to the British Government for the reception of the 
sick and wounded convalescents from South Africa and 
Senhor Rocha Machado has munificently placed at the dis 
posal of the War Office his wellknown Mourit Quinta for the 
reception of officers during the next six months 
The Mount Quinta is one of the show places of Madeira 
standing on a mountain spur over Funchal about 2000 fee 
above the sea in many acres of ornamentallyplanted gardense 
The air at this altitude is invigorating and the temperature 
though IO F lower than at Funchal has a small diurnal 
variation only and admits of the openair lounging sort of 
life which is so characteristic of the winter season in the 
environs of Funebal below The equipment of Senhor 
Machados villa is entrusted to an adequate staff Lwho are 
expected to arrive this week from England 
Accommodation in other regions has also been prepared 
but our chief reliance rests upon the experienced efforts of 
the hotel proprietors who are quite equal to the supply of 
any demand which may suddenly arise and who will readily 
avail themselves if need be of a selection from the numerous 
quintas in which these mountain slopes abound in every 
variety of situation I have long since communicated in 
detail to the Principal Medical Officers at the Cape the various 
points of interest in the climate accommodation and food 
supplies of Madeira and also the peculiar facilities which 
here exist for the outofdoor life and passive exercise of con 
valescents specifying sufferers from dysentery enteric fever 
loss of blood and pulmonary disorders as those likely to 
derive speedy benefit as well as the actually wounded 
Of late years I have advocated Madeira for many varieties 
of Brights diFease and albuminuria and have had excellent 
recoveries especially where improvement had been arrested 
by intercurrent inflammatory attacks due to chill and tempera 
ture changes 
The summer months in Madeira are spent in the pineclad 
hills from 2000 to 3000 feet above sea level in one or two 
districts where English people have from time to time built 
commodious houses in spacious grounds and it would be hard 
to give any adequate description of the matchless beauty of 
these mountain regions Two years ago I spent a part of the 
summer at a much higher altitude over 5000 feet engaged in 
magnetic and atmospheric electrical observations in a climate 
of marvellous dryness and reflected upon the varieties of 
climate which are to be found in the small space occupied by 
Madeira 
The sunshine in Funebal during January registered about 
6k hours a day The island is now singularly healthy Cer 
tain improvements have been made in the water supply to tbe 
town and the municipality are engaged in bringing down 
spring water from a great altitude for general distribution 
For this and other sanitary purposes it has been my privilege 
to persuade the Government at Lisbon to devote annually a 
large sum of money 
Madeira is about 1300 miles distant from Southampton and 
travelling by a fast steamer is now reached in a little more th an 
three days the steamers moreover have grown in my time 
from 500 tons to 13oO tOns 
I will only add that Field Marshal Lord Roberts received 
with much interest my information as to the availability of 
this island for the sick and wounded and took personal charge

CARE OF OUR WOUNDED 
WHATEVER may be the defects in our artillery transport ar 
rangements and other purely military details which we leave 
for military experts to decide and in reference to which the 
public who so freely criticise must bear in mind the unusual 
conditions to be faced and the erroneous estimates which 
Colonial as well as Imperial authorities made at the outset of 
the Boer forces there can be no question as to the admirable 
work done by both the ambulance and hospital cops Tihe 
answer given by the UnderSecretary of State for War to the 
question addressed to bim by Dr Farquharson on February 8th 
was published in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of February 
ioth but it appears that Mr Wyndham did notread the whole 
of the telegram sent by Sir Redvers Buller The remaining 
portion was published in the Daily News February gth and 
as it is of such an interesting character it may here be repro 
duced 
 We have been fighting here for a week 33 miles from the railway and 
soo to 1200 feet above our wheeled transport and it was only on the 24th 
that every wounded man was not admitted to the hospital the day he was 
wounded Then follow figures showing that on the 20th January 2 men 
were admitted to the field hospital  on the 21st I55 on the 22nd 299 on 
the 23rd 73 on the 24th none on the 25thl 558 on the 26th 4 and on 
the 27th I the total being o038 At the same time the transfer of 
wounded men from the field hospital to the base hospital at Mooi River 
was going on It began on the 21st January when 2 patients were trans 
ferred Next day there were none but on the 23rd there were 1I7  on the 
24th I62 on the 25th 67 on the 26th 75  on the 27th 172 on the 28th 
I77 on the 29th I5  total 86x Then comes a passage showing how ten 
derly the injured nmen are cared for  A hundred and seventysix cases 
in hospital here These are the dangerously wounded and as when 
they are fit to move they will be carried by hand on stretchers the whole 
way to Frere as I fear the ambulances are too rough 
With regard to the complaints as to the hospital at Cape 
town sent home by the Times correspondent an officer 
Colonel Featherstonhaugh who was himself a wounded pa 
tient in the Wynberg hospital and who has recently returned 
to his home in the Isle of Wight has written a letter to that 
journal in the course of which he says that he desires dis 
tinctly to deny that complaints have been freely made by 
officers and men in the military hospital 
There is no want of organisation or foresight in the arrangements made 
for the comforts of the patients the standard of living is very good con 
valescent officers are sent to Claremont and the serious cases are kept at 
Np I Hospital where every care is bestowed upon them I cannot speak 
too highly of the attention of the nursing sisters who day and night are 
in attendance 
In my last letter I quoted extracts from the letter of a civil 
surgeon attached to the base hospital at Capetown speaking 
in the highest terms of the comforts provided for both officers 
and men By the last mail a furtber letter has been received 
from this correspondent from which I may quote the following 
passages 
Nos I and No 2 Hospitals are at Wynberg conjointly they can accoim 
modate about Iooo to 1200 patients the soldiers are well provided with 
excellent food drinks wines stout ale aerated waters books papers 
etc The library I may mention is under the direct suipervision of Mrs 
Dick Chamberlain it is called Mrs Dick Chamberlains Hospital 
Library Each ward has a box of books with a catalogue and periodic 
ally the wards exchange boxes thus Tommy is supplied with unlimited 
novels of the latest date Charitable workers send instalments of flowers 
fruit and other luxuries 
The operating theatre is large and lofty and well lighted has a marble 
tiled floor which slopes to one corner the walls and ceiling being lined 
by enamelled tin It is kept spotlessly clean and white 
Each 2 or 3 lhuts a hut is equivalent to a ward each ward contains 
about 2 beds is under the direct control of one surgeon thus I have 
three h its The whole of No I General Hospital is divided into A the 
surgical and B the medical division superintending the surgical 
division is one RAMC officer and similarly the medical side has one 
RAMC The RAMC officer visits the huts of his division daily but 
never interferes with the treatment adopted by the surgeon in charge 
Each day an orderly medical officer is appointed he has to remain in 
or near the orderly tent during the afternoon and night in case of emerg 
encies Each civilian surgeon is supposed to commence his work at 
9 AM and he may not leave camp till X PM He is again to visit his 
wards in theevening No I Hospital is at present occupying the perma 
nent military barracks of Wynberg No 2 Hospital is under canvas and 
the cases do remarkably well No I Hospital is nearly full up half the 
eaqsq have come from the transports direct from Southampton Pneu 
monia antd pleurisy are very common this may be accounted for by 
the men while on board ship being required to go without boots and 
socks 
As my patients are chronicsas indeed are all at present in the hos 
pitalI will not give particulars about them but later on when fresh 
cases arrive from the battlefields I will endeavour to communicate what 
is interesting 
Lords Roberts and Kitchener have visited the hospital sBobs ap 
pears quiet and reserved He takes quite an interest in the cases inquir 
ing most earnestly into the circumstances whereby each patient was 
injured Bobs is a great favourite with our Tommies 
This correspondent therefore clearly thinks that the hos 
pital accommodation for the men is good and it is possible 
that some of the complaints and criticisms which have found 
their way into the press emanate from some of the numerous 
wellmeaning visitors whose offers were referred to in an article 
in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of February 3rd The 
lady with no nursing experience but with a patriotic desire to 
nuree the wounded appears to have been rather strongly in 
evidence and inasmuch as her services have been declined 
in favour of her trained sister it is possible that disappoint 
ment may occasionally give rise to somewhat harsh criticism 
A story which I heard the other day will illustrate this One 
of these ladies having been admitted to a ward asked a patient 
an Irish soldier if she might sponge his face for him The 
patient replied Yes my dear lady you may sponge my 
face five other ladies have already washed it this morning 
but you may wash it too 
NURSING IN THE MILITARY HOSPITALS 
At the same time the one point which does seem open to 
question is whether trained nurses have really been em 
ployed to a sufficient extent at any rate at the base hospitals 
at Capetown The opinion of the medical correspondent 
from whom I have already quoted is at any rate to the effect 
that  more qualified nurses are required Thus he says 
 At the best of times one day nurse has at least 4o beds and 
at night time one nurse has 9 huts to take charge ofthat is 
over i8o beds for each but has 20 or in some cases more 
beds This appears on the face of it rather unsatisfactory 
but it must be borne in mind that male orderlies or nurses 
are employed not only in hospitals at the front but also in 
military hospitals at home Thus my correspondent says 
that each hut has a male orderly and I would point out that 
even at Netley a very large amount of what is usually 
regarded as nursing yvork is done by these same orderlies 
I confess from personal experience that I am by no means 
enamoured of the male orderly as a nurse I have had charge 
of a hospital where none but male orderlies were used and I 
have no hesitation in saying that nursing duties are not as a 
rule so well performed even by trained men of this sort as by 
trained women nurses But these views notwithstanding it 
is only fair to remember that we are aeked to condemn an old 
system and not merely a temporary arrangement for a cam 
paign 
RAMC SOUTH AFRICAN FUND 
Lady Randolph Churchill despatched the other day a cable 
gram with reference to the work being done on the Maine 
which will have been read with great interest In this she 
said that among the wounded from Colenso and Spion Kop 
were stretcher bearers and Army Medical Corps men This 
confirms what we have already learnt from other corre 
spondents  namely that the men engaged as stretcher 
bearers and ambulance work generally on the field of battle 
are exposed to very considerable danger Under these circum 
stances the appeal made by the RAMC South African 
Committee in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of February ioth 
has a special interest and it is earnestly to be hoped that 
members of the profeRsion will contribute their halfcrowns 
for in this way a respectable sum might quickly be collected 
It is to be hoped also that the suggestion to form Ladies 
Committees in the cities and county towns of the United 
Kingdom will be taken up by the wives of medical men 
Subscriptions as will be seen may be sent to the Editor of 
the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 
MEDICAL ATTACHES 
In the last number of the Lancet an interesting letter from 
Sir William Mac Cormac appeared in which he stated that 
two German medical attach6s Stabearzt Dr Schmidt and 
Stabsarzt Dr Krummacher had just returnedtoCapetown from 
the Modder River where they had been working in the field 


FEB 17 1900 SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES  DCALJOURXAL 413 
under the medical officer to the brigade of Guards These 
attach6s it appears are the first accredited medical attach6s 
which have been sent to the front by a foreign State to ob 
serve what may be learned by the campaign The services 
and observations of these two gentlemen are thus referred to 
by the correspondent from whose letter I have already 
quoted 
I had visiting me today two captains of the Army Medical Corps of th3 
German army who were sent out by the German Government to report 
on the injuries of modern weapons the systems employed in our military 
field and base hospitals and our ambulance work It so happened that 
in the pursuance of their duties they were present at the Magersfontein 
battle here as you are aware our surgeons were particularly busy so 
the two Germans lent their ready aid and were employed treating both 
our wounded and those of the enemy who were captured They have 
twice visited my wards and made numerous notes about the cases such 
as the exact injury the bullet the range etc 
NURSES IN THE HOSPITALS AFTER COLENSO 
MR FREDERICK TREVES in a letter which he has addressed to 
tL e London Hospital Gazette from Frere Camp writes as 
follows with regard to the services rendered by four lady 
nurseshis own two nurses and two army nursing sisters 
after the battle of Coleneo 
When we reached Frere these two ladies Mr Trevess own nurses found 
themselves in the distinguished position of being the only two European 
women in a camp of 30000 men They were treated with the very greatest 
possible kindness and attention by Tommy who is the most chivalrous of 
men  The nurses were at it all Friday night and all Saturday They had 
no sleep and the splendid work they aid is beyond any praise Howthey 
managed to keep about I dont know  I should have said that two 
Netley Sistersone an old  London  nursejoined us just before we left 
Frere and better nurses and more devoted women I never met They 
worked night and day and their work was of the very best Poor Tommy 
may not think much of the  Orspittle  at Chieveley but T know he will 
never forget the fouir women who stood bv him after Tugela and tried to 
make him comfortable They never rested They givehim all they had 
their water bottles their handkerchiefs and even their mattresses to lie 
on Their very presence among the dead and dying was something and 
they thought of means of giving relief that would not have occurred to us 
men I suppose they are the only women who have been really  at the 
front in this war 
A SCOTTISH HOSPITAL FOR SOUTH AFRICA 
A Scottish hospital for South Africa is to be provided funds to be raised 
by public subscription The Lord Provost of Edinburgli has already re 
ceived more than half the sum required X12ooo The doctors and nurses 
will be Scottish but the hospital will not be confined to the treatment of 
Scottish soldiers 
THE MEDICAL SERVICE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE 
The Daily Mail of February 5th in an interesting special article by 
Julian Ralph on  The War as it is Today depicting  scenes and sounds 
of modern battles alludes to the medicai aspects in the following terms 
 The bravery of our stretcherbearers is as much beyond question as it is 
beyond praise When all of us lesser and immediate historians of the 
moment have told of the valour of all the generals colonels majors cap 
tains and  Tommies  of the army we shall still have in common jus 
tice to describe how the chaplains doctors and stretcherbearers go in 
and out of the most hellish fire not once or twice but all through every 
battle

was replied to by LieutenantGeneral KENT and Sir JOHN 
COCKBUIRN KCMG 
Mr BALFOUR in proposing the toast of Kings College 
said I rise to propose what is called the toast of the evening 
I rise in other words to recall your attention to the central 
interest which has brought us all together this evening to 
this hall to enjoy the splendid hospitality of Kings College but 
I feel that I do so under circumstances of very peculiar diffi 
culty The toast of the evening if it is estimated by the 
nearness in pint of interest to the hearts of each one of us 
is not and cannot be the toast that I am about to propose It 
is the toast to which you have just listuned At such a time 
it is difficult for us to withdraw attention from the topies so 
eloquently dealt with by the proposer of the last toast by the 
gallant general who responded on behalf of  The Army and 
by the eloquent and admirable exponent of Colonial feeling 
whom you have just listened to I doubt not with the emo 
tions which stirred my own heart whilst he was speaking 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION 
I must ask you for a moment to turn your thoughts from 
these great military and imperial interests to interests far re 
moved from them indeed but perhaps in a sense not less 
intimately and permanently connected with our greatness 
and our prosperity as a nation For the toast reduced to its 
narrowest limits which I have to propose to you is the ad 
vancement of scientific research in this great metropolis of 
ours in the University which we have recently remodelled 
and more especially in that College where I hope and trust 
your liberality will enable the interests of science to be pur 
sued in the future with an even greater success than they have 
been pursued in the past We have all probably been con 
cerned either in making speeches or in listening to speeches 
in recent years on the subject of technical education a very 
loose phrase sometimes used or misused to mean education 
in manipulation or dexterity of hand treatment sometimes 
and I think more probablyused to mean that application 
of the principles of science to industrial life which we are more 
and more beginning to recognise as an increasing need of the 
age in which we live Now it has been found easy and I 
hope it always will be easy to enlist popular sym 
patby in anything so obviously useful as the application of 
scientific method to industrial pursuits And it will be all 
the more easy from the fact that we have before us in certain 
foreign countries striking and admirable instances of the 
method and of the suncess which attends or may attend such 
application of scientific method to industrial pursuits that 
everybody can understand An appeal for that purpose is an 
appeal which touches the heartof everybody nearly or remotely 
connected with the industries on which this nation as a whole 
lives and on which it must continue to live if it is to live at 
all 
RESEARCH IN PURE SCIENCE 
I appeal for something not less necessary but something 
perhaps more remote from the ordinary everyday popular 
educational interest for I appeal on the present occasion not 
so much for anything in the nature of technical instruction or 
applied science as for aid to carry out that instruction in 
science itself and those researches in pure science which lie 
at the base of that instruction which from the very nature 
of the case can only appeal indirectly and remotely to the 
great mass of mankind And yet after all science is the 
essential method that we have got to consider Its applica 
tions will come and must come will comealmost of themselves 
must come in the course of time but you cannot have applied 
science without having science in the first instance and ii 
you do not cultivate scientific research and scientific educa 
tion it will be in vain that you multiply your technica 
schools and it will be in vain that you labour to erect a great 
superstructure where your foundations have been so inade 
quately laid I feel it the more incumbent upon me to urge 
upon you the claims and the glories of science pursued for 
itself from the very fact that they cannot directly appeal to 
the general interest of the mass of mankind We ought not 
to wonder we ought not to criticise and we ought not to be 
surprised that among the great number of persons deeply 
interested and astonished at for example so interesting and 
sensational a discovery as wireless telegraphy should number 
the inventions which have made that telegraphy possible 
which could neither know of nor take an interest in the specu 
lations of a Maxwell or of the experiments of Hertz which 
after all are at the base of the whole thing without which 
11o such discovery as wireless telegraphy would have been 
lpossible but whose discoverers had indeed fame and reputa 
tion among those scientific men and people of understanding 
in their work but who have not perhaps even now that 
worldwide reputation that currency in the mouths of men 
which fall to inventors much less than themselves and who 
lhave biilt their work and rightly and properly built their
