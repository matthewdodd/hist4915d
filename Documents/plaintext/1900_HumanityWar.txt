SMALLBORE RIFLE BULLET WOUNDS AND THE 
HUMANITY OF THE PRESENT WAR 
Delivered at St Georges Hospital on May 1st 1900 
By CLINTON T DENT MC FRCS 
Surgeon to the Hospital 
We are all I suppose a little prone to assume that what is 
new to us is necessarily new to everyone else  and that of 
what we have lately learned others must necessarily be 
ignorant The mere fact that I mention such a truism may 
however be taken as a proof that I do not share in the belief 
In this South African campaignrather prematurely called 
in some quarters the Transvaal warthere are so many 
features of novelty that even the most cursory sketch of some 
may prove of interest I do not o course lay claim to any 
profound knowledge or experience of gunshot wounds  and in 
drawing comparison with the results of other wars I have been 
compelled to resort to books and statistical reports Fortu 
nately military medical statistics relating to losses in wars 
are uniformly reliable  and indeed are given with a merci 
less thoroughness As far as regards the present campaign I have 
had a fortunate experience for in the course of the past few 
months I have I suppose seen between 2000 and 3000 wounds 
nearer the latter figure I suspect than the former It is 
easy enough to waste time for war provides endless distrac 
tions and excitement but during my time I stuck closely to 
work throughout disregarding even the fascinations of Cape 
town Everywhere as I moat gratefully acknowledge I re 
ceived the utmost courtesy and the utmost attention from 
high civil officials from staff officers and from the medical 
officers of all ranks To them my very warmest thanks are 
due My experience was principally if not almost entirely 
limited to the base hospitals and the stationary hospitals It 
is there after all as it appears to me that the civilian is best 
placed There one can judge deliberately of organisation as a 
whole or of medical details  and it is certainly there that free 
from the hurry and rush which are absolutely inseparable 
from work nearer the front one can best study gunshot 
wounds and best watch the effects and results of treatment 
My mission was a twofold one  first to study the whole army 
medical organisation as it was working on a large scale in this 
present war  and the other was to learn all I could about the 
fleets of gunshot wounds inflicted with the most modern 
weapons 
Army Medical Organisation 
You will pardon me if on the first of these matters I pre 
serve silence beyond making the one remark that it appears 
to me to be premature at present either to endorse or to ques 
tion the criticism that has been made in some quarters of the 
army medical organisation as a whole or on the other hand to 
j 
join in the somewhat fulsome or at any rate full stream of 
eulogy and praise which is in other quarters lavished on the 
entire department Efficient it isthat much I will say 
more efficient beyond all question than any army medical 
organisation that has ever been in any campaign of any 
magnitude yet But I hope that that will not prevent us in 
the future from striving to make it much better 
The Humanity of Modern Warfare 
It is often said that this is a humane war I am disposed to 
take the remark as a sort of text for my lecture and to con 
sider from a broad standpoint the auestion of the humanity of 
this war That statement is chiefly founded on the fact that 
modern smallbore gunshot wounds display remarkable fea 
tures  that wounds do well  that operations do well  and 
that many of the recoveries that have taken place are un 
doubtedly very remarkable 
Professor Bruns anticipated as the result of a series of ex 
perimental observations made a few years ago that the next 
war would be a humane one The experiments were made on 
the dead bodies of men and horses Bullets were fired into 
them at known ranges and the effects were noted The 
weapons used were smallbore rifles On the other hand 
theorists like M Bloch in that remarkable work of his Is 
War Now Impossible f takes absolutely the opposite view He 
thinks war will be so inhumane that it will be impossible 
Here we have contrasted the prophetic views of the practical 
man and of the theorist I suppose that judging by experi 
ence of the present campaign in the whole history of litera 
ture no theory has ever been more astonishingly wide of the 
fact than that of M Bloch has proved itself to be One is re 
minded of an old remark of Ambroise Par at the end of his 
treatise on gunshot wounds 
 
See gentlemen how I learned 
to treat gunshot woundsnot by books Ambroise Par did 
not underrate his own superlative merits  but he was a great 
and a wise surgeon and recognised that there was but one 
way of gaining real knowledge of this class of injuries 
Indeed while the theorist is hopelessly wrong the experi 
menter has already been shown to be very frequently far from 
right in his views 
There are other factors of the first importance to be taken 
into account besides the effects of these s tnallbore bullets 
To these factors I wish first to draw attention But before 
passing on I may say at once that it has been abundantly 
proved in the present war that the view is a correct one that 
the great majority of wounds are inflicted by rifle bullets and 
do not result from shell Are  that is borne out beyond all 
question 
Septic Diseases 
My point however is that the humanity of a war is not to 
be gauged solely by the nature of the bullet wounds From 
the broader and purely surgical point of view a war is 
humane or not according to the answer to be returned to this 
question  Are there or are there not present the great class of 
septic disorders such as pyaemia erysipelas septicaemia 
hospital gangrene tetanus osteomyelitis and the rest 
We know that these diseases are really preventable Have 
we succeeded in preventing them  If they are absent from 
my present point of view it may be regarded as a humane 
war  if they are present as an inhumane one Hitherto 
and I desire to emphasise the fact stronglythese diseases 
j 
have been almost if not entirely absent in this war I cannot 
 
recall having seen a case of pyaemia or tetanus or  
hospital 
gangrene or osteomyelitis A satisfactory condition of affairs 
i you will think Such it undoubtedly is  and yet I wish at 
once to touch a discordant note and to state my decided im 
pression that in some parts of the seat of war wounds are not 
now doing quite so well as they did at the outset To this I 
will allude again later on Meanwhile I wish to draw your 
attention to the various factors that have contributed to the 
exceptional results that have hitherto been obtained One is 
the condition of our men The sea voyage to the Cape told 
all in their favour Of the weak and weedy striplings who I 
had been assured formed the bulk of our army I saw hardly 
any examples If they were put on board the transports in 
England they had been got rid of before the troops were 
landed at the Cape I saw regiment after regiment disem 
bark almost uniformly the men seemed a vigorous and 
healthy lot The regiment in particular that I went out with 
the Second Lancashire Fusiliers were a remarkably fine set 
of men for the work in hand The troops had as a rule been 
I well fed on board and they have to say the least been ade 
quately nourished on shore The good feeding of an army is 
of enormous importance We may have in this campaign 
ignored to our loss some of the Napoleonic maxims but the 
authorities have realised to the full one of the utmost value 
to the effect that 
 an army moves on its belly 
Commissariat and Transport 
Now if one depattment may be praised unreservedly in 
this campaign more than another it is certainly the com 
missariat department The way they have done their work is 
marvellous It seems to me that such a department has its 
full share of blame when things go wrong but that it does 
not get its fair meed of praise when things go right And on 
this occasion things have gone right To those who have been 
working in hospitals this has been abundantly clear The 
progress of a case of sickness and the behaviour of a wound 
form a very delicate test of a mans condition As an instance 
of the difference that it makes whether men are well or ill fed 
take the case of the Lad y smith garrison On January 30th 
1900 there were out of the Ladysmith garrison in Intombi

and in Ladysmith itself over 2500 sick and wounded in 
hospitalsay onesixth of the force disabled through sick 
ness and wounds This condition of affairs was largely owing 
to the short rationsand the rations were short and un 
commonly bad  there is no harm in saying so now All the 
more honour to the garrison who stood it all 
Diseases complicating wounds were not much in evidence 
The diseases that the medical officers have chiefly had to 
contend with are in the first place enteric But the enteric 
is of the most terrible type that I have ever seen Probably 
not far short of 30 percent of its victims died Then there 
was dysentery in its various forms some of it very mild 
much of it not dysentery at all There was rheumatism to 
some extent but comparatively little malaria save amongst 
the soldiers who came from India or who had seen service in 
malarious districts elsewhere There were probably far more 
cases of pneumonia on board the transports on the voyage out 
than in the hospitals in South Africa where the disease was 
but seldom seen 
Another factor is the transport If the transport is bad or 
if the conditions under which the wounded soldiers are con 
veyed back to the field stationary or base hospital be un 
favourable the cases are likely to do badly On the whole 
the transport has been good Sometimes the conditions were 
very trying as for instance after the Spion Kop action 
where after the men crossed back over the Tugela to Spear 
mans Camp they had twentythree miles of rough country to 
traverse in dhoolies or ambulance cartsbefore they joined the 
railway line at Frere There was the same trouble after the 
action at Vaal Kranz and after that at Pieters Hill when 
the final relief of Ladysmith was effected Again the battle 
of Paardeberg was fought a long way from the railway line 
and the nearest stationary hospitals at Kimberley In all 
these instances the difficulties of the return journey and the 
difficulties of transport were very great The condition of the 
wounded soldiers on arrival was proportionately bad At the 
extreme front the conditions were good Never I suppose 
have more efficient and courageous stretcherbearer companies 
been organised than in this war It may be gathered that 
they were not easily kept in order Many of them were 
refugees from Johannesburg and suchlike places All agree 
that the way they would go out under fire to fetch in the 
wounded men and the rapidity with which they would get 
them back to the hospital were deserving of the very highest 
praise It would be very seldom that the ordinary stretcher 
bearer companies could be got to show the courage under fire 
that these men did on many occasions  so the wounded were 
got back from the field quickly The ambulance trains did 
their share of the work well The Cape Government Bail way 
officials worked with a will On the Natal side that extra 
ordinary organiser Mr David Hunter the general manager 
of the Natal Government Kailways worked the transport with 
astonishing smoothness Consequently the wounded were 
given every chance to do well 
The Climate 
The climate was absolutely the strongest point in our 
favour Consider in Natal alone the heights at which the 
hospitals were Maritzburg where the great central base hos 
pitals are placed is at a height of 2200 feet above the sea 
Ladysmith itself is 2300 Estcourt 3000  and one of the 
best hospitals in South Africa that at Mooi Biver which is 
No 4 General Hospital the altitude is 4500 feet In the 
matter of climate no more perfect place for a hospital than 
Mooi Biver could well be imagined The climate whether 
in Natal or in Cape Colony appears to be surgically almost 
sterile a point of the very first importance The same holds 
in Cape Colony the hospitals stand high From a few hours 
after leaving Wynberg the railway mounts up by a steep 
incline and on to the high veld a huge tableland which 
stretches away over the Karoo for hundreds of miles until the 
slope begins to fall again towards the Zambesi You therefore 
have a huge elevated dry plateau the veld at a height of 
4000 and 5000 feet In this warm dry climatesometimes 
very hot in the middle of the day and very cold at night but 
dry and with a sandy sojlthe openair method of treatment 
can be practised to an extent that I confess at first staggered 
me One saw patients lying in the hospitals in the marquee tents with the door flaps open and the tent looped up all 
round with the windows open and the dust if there was any 
wind 
 and there generally is wind  
blowing through 
but nothing bad ever came of it The patients could be 
dressed or undressed or operated on for that matter practic 
ally in the open air and yet if due precautions were takei 
against unnecessary chilling no harm followed 
The Hospitals 
If one thing was proved more conclusively than another in 
the Crimean war it was the necessity for air space and light 
in hospitals and the experience of this campaign has borne it 
out The chief medical authorities have taken this lesson at 
least fully to heart and their wisdom in so doing has been 
proved to the hilt Whenever the climatic conditions permit 
I should give the preference to tents of whatever pattern 
they be rather than to huts even in base hospitals Huts are 
necessarily more close Public buildings churches schools 
and the rest are far less suitable 
The wide distribution of the hospitals was another highly 
advantageous factor In Natal the hospitals are spread over 
180 miles and between Cape Colony and Bloemfontein the 
line of communications dotted over with hospitals is 750 
miles long In South Africa good sites for hospitals can be 
found everywhere Contrast with that the condition of 
things in the Crimea where it was hardly possible to find a 
suitable place to pitch a hospital in the whole peninsula 
Another feature of the campaign itself from the military 
point of view has been in favour of the medical men at the 
hospitals At no time has there been any severe strain on 
the hospitals There have been a series of sharp engage 
ments it is true  but these were fought for the most part at 
distinct intervals and over a large tract of country The 
strain was thrown equally on two separate hospital systems 
one in Natal the other in Cape Colony Lord Methuens 
battles at Belmont Graspan Modder River and Magers 
fontein followed it is true quickly one after another When 
I first went out there were some 1100 wounded in the base 
hospitals at Capetown practically all of them coming from 
the Modder River district But though this aggregate was 
fairly large the patients had not been all at once thrown on 
the hands of the medical officera There had been oppor 
tunities of partially clearing the hospitals in front and the 
wounded had been sent down in batches In Natal I question 
whether at one time a strain such as was anticipated could 
have been adequately met There is no harm in saying so 
now when the fighting in Natal is obviously over A request 
had been sent down to get ready at least 5000 beds when the 
advance was first made on Lady smith However as it turned 
out there were a series of engagements fought and so the 
hospitals were never overcrowded 
Antiseptic Treatment 
With regard to antiseptics this is really the very first war 
of any magnitude in which the antiseptic system has been 
used on a large scale In the RussoTurkish war it was 
employed on a small scale but with the most admirable 
results by some German surgeons The results are even 
better in this war There has been an abundance of surgical 
materials and the organisation has been well managed so 
that all the materials of one kind are not crowded into one 
place and all those of another kind into another place The 
various packages have been intelligently made up so that for 
example the whole of the chloroform has not been sent into 
Natal while all the cyanide gauze was sent to Cape Colony 
Preposterous mistakes of the sort have before now occurred in 
war even with English officials at the head of affairs 
Dressings were lavishly supplied and were lavishly not to 
say extravagantly used Still I take it the British taxpayer 
will not mind that In certain details on the other hand 
needless economy seemed to be observed While the amount 
of dressings used in the hospitals was perfectly astounding 
there appeared to me to take a single instance to be a most 
singular parsimony with regard to the issue of nailbrushes 
apparently insignificant but yet really most important 
articles in a surgical ward or operating theatre The medical 
men had often tb provide their own Those who know some 
thing of the peculiarities of military methods are aware that 
it will take you quite as much trouble and possibly quite as 
long to get a nailbrush as say 500 extra bedsteads All the 


Mat 19 1900I THE HUMANITY OF SMALLBORE RIFLES BtoSLwoSS  
men were supplied with field dressings  of the value of these 
I cannot say much but I have no doubt they did some good 
The dressings in the field hospitals were always abundant 
but necessarily in the field hospitals the minute details of 
the antiseptic system cannot be very thoroughly practised 
With regard to the practice of the antiseptic system 
throughout this campaign I hardly know what to say per 
haps it will be best at present to say no more than this  that 
it is abundantly clear that the elaboration of detail which is 
found absolutely necessary in a London civil hospital may be 
and perhaps is pretty often dispensed with out there under 
less favourable conditions of climate and of the other sur 
roundings  have mentioned they certainly could not have 
been disregarded with equal impunity Yet it must not 
be supposed that all wounds heal by first intention there and 
that everything goes on in the best possible way in the best 
of all possible climates Suppuration was common enough 
almost from the first and it became more abundant as time 
went on Many cases of compound fracture came down to the 
base hospitals suppurating very freely It is not likely that 
the behaviour of wounds will improve Indeed I think it is 
getting rather worse  it is worst on the Natal side where the 
climate is not quite so good and some of the hospitals are 
getting somewhat worn from use Of course the progress of 
a fracture depends very greatly on the amouot of disturbance 
of the parts rendered inevitable by transport But I saw 
nothing beyond suppuration with high temperature when 
pus was locked up in a wound or when sloughs were separat 
ing from a wound So soon as the offending part was dealt 
withamputated if necessarythe temperature sank and 
the case did well Of pysemia and septicaemia one saw noth 
ing and of tetanus nothing whatever  I do not believe there 
has been a case yet 
With regard to erysipelas until yesterday I would have 
said that there had not been a case of erysipelas  but only 
yesterday I received information of the death of a young 
officer whom I saw in Natal from whom a bullet had been ex 
tracted and who died I regret to say according to report 
from erysipelas The circumstances I do not yet know but I 
must say it seems to me that even if it be a single isolated 
case it is still of very grave import I only heard of this long 
after I had thought upon the subject and ventured to predict 
that the cases were not doing so well and that the staff must 
keep a sharp lookout for graver septic complications In 
some of these the cases are very septic  the sept ici ty was not 
matter for much surprise For example there were some 
Boers who had been wounded at Paardeberg in the Kimberley 
Hospitalan admirable hospitalwho were not received until 
a fortnight after the action Two of them had compound com 
minuted fractures of the arm involving the elbow So far as I 
could learn the only dressings they had applied had been 
tobacco juice with tobacco leaves over the wound They pre 
served their limbs but whether in consequence of the tobacco 
juice I cannot tell you Indeed I believe they preserved 
their limbs chiefly by declining altogether to part with them 
Ultimately although at one time the cases did not look at all 
hopeful they were on the mend 
The Proportion of Wounded to Killed 
Professor Billroth writing only a few years ago about the 
next great war was convinced that there would be an increase 
in the number of wounded owing to the adoption of smallbore 
rifles He thought too that the proportion of severely wounded 
would be very greatly increased That anticipation has not 
been borne out The proportion of killed to wounded up to 
the present in this campaign is about the usual oneabout 
one killed to four wounded It has often been much higher 
than that In the RussoTurkish war the proportion of killed 
to wounded on the Russian side during the assault of Plevna 
was i to 21 There as you will remember the attack was 
made on an enemy in very strong position the condition of 
affairs that has obtained in most of our engagements 
Deaths prom Wounds 
The mimt er of the deaths from wounds is however much 
more to the point On this topic I must say a word even at 
the risk of wearying you with figures for on the  deaths 
from wounds the health of the troops in the campaign may 
be determined the efficiercy of the hospital evstem esti 
mated and from my point of view the humanity of the war 
gauged It is not merely by the severity of the wound that 
a particular bullet inflicts or by the amount of laceration that 
it entails that we should judge We must first take into 
account wounds which are necessarily mortal but in which it 
is possible to transport the patient to hospital These are 
comparatively few In this war as in others those who are 
not killed at once by some such injury as smashing up of the 
skull or injury to the spinal cord high up die if they die in 
the field of haemorrhage Of the wounds which are likely to 
be returned as  
mortal 
 
we may take some but very few to 
be of the head Either the man is killed at once or there is a 
likelihood of recovery A large proportion of abdominal 
wounds prove fatal perhaps 40 or 50 per cent The same may 
be said of injuries of the spinal cord but after a distinct lapse 
of time after they get into the hospital Wounds of the bladder 
have shown bad results in this campaign  and necessarily also 
bad compound fracture of the femur high up But with 
regard to all the rest if a man can get into the hospital 
wounded he has a chance of recovery unless he dies of one of 
those septic disorders That is abundantly proved by the 
returns officially furnished It is a curious fact that up to a 
certain date in March we had 4934 wounded taking non 
commissioned officers and men alone Now in the Franco 
German war the Fourteenth German Army Corps up to a par 
ticular date had 4344 wounded The numbers are very similar 
Of these 4344 Germans 617 died  and of our 4934 239 died 
Put into percentages it comes roughly to this  a mortality of 
44 
deaths from wounds 
 
amounting to 5 per cent in our army 
and in the Fourteenth Army Corps to 14 per cent Of the 617 
Germans who died 304 died of pyaemia and septicaemia and 
39 of tetanus If we exclude then these preventable dis 
orders the mortality in the two armies is almost the same 
namely 5 per cent in our army and 6 per cent in the German 
army corps This result is eurely very striking and very 
instructive 
Shell and Shrapnel Wounds 
And now with regard to the humanity of the wounds I 
have nothing to say about shell wounds  they are very much 
as before Comparatively few men are killed by themat any 
rate it is a very costly way of destroying or attempting to 
destroy your enemies More are killed hy shrapnel But it 
is abundantly clear on both sides that shell and shrapnel fire 
and especially the missiles from quickfiring machine guns 
have a widespread demoralising effect on the troops 
Bullet Wounds 
Let us consider only the smallbore rifles Of course 
44smallbore is only a relative term The calibre of the 
Mauser is 7 mm or 0275 of an inch and that of the Lee 
Enfield 77 mm or 0303 of an inch As regards efficiency 
there seems very little to choose between the two rifles It is 
of the bullet that I wish chiefly to speak The core in both 
consists of hardened lead covered over with a mantle or en 
velope The envelope in our bullet is made of copper nickel 
in the proportions of 80 per cent of copper and 20 per cent of 
nickel The diameter of the bullet is 0311 inch The diameter 
of the Mauser bullet is 0284 inch The bullets are therefore 
so to speak larger than the bore of the rifle barrel As they 
are forced through by the explosion they 
 
take the grooving 
 
and the rifling of the barrel imparts the movement of rotation 
in the longitudinal axis of the bullet I want you particularly 
 to notice as shown by the sections 
l  Fig the relative thickness of the 
 k sheath or mantle The sheath of the 
ifia Mauser bullet is of steel nickel ed 
rHu over Ours as already stated is of 
HB copper nickel 
There is no need to weary you 
B with minute details The main 
B point is that in modern rifles there 
H is an exceedingly high muzzle ve 
H locity Roughly the bullet leaves 
KB the muzzle of the Mauser rifle at 
dB 
a rate of About 1500 miles an hour 
IMP which is pretty rapid going at 
rMy CJ 
1300 yards the velocity works out 
at between 800 and 900 miles an hour The muzzle ve 
locity of our rifle is rather lower than that of the Mauser

but the energy at 1000 yards is greater The trajectory is 
practically flat up to 500 yardsthat is to say if a man is in 
a trench and holds his rifle on the level close to the ground 
the danger zone is 500 yards  in other words the bullet will 
not rise more than 6 feet for the first 500 yards The rifling 
is intensely sharp  there is a complete turn in S66 inches in 
the Mauser rifle and one in 10 inches in the LeeEn field so 
that the rapidity of rotation communicated to the bullet is 
tremendous The energy of the bullet also is enormous The 
energy of a bullet it is computed depends on the mass of 
the bullet multiplied by the square of its velocity so that a 
small bullet going with a high velocity may have as much 
energy as a large bullet going with a low velocity The weight 
of the Mauser bullet varies from 172 to 175 grs and that of 
our bullet is 215 grs 
Explosive and Expanding Bullets 
Much has been said about 
 
explosive 
 
bullets and I think 
people abroad and at home have allowed their feelings to be 
carried away rather on the subject No such thing as a truly 
explosive bullet has been used in this campaign by either 
side Explosive bullets were forbidden altogether by the 
St Petersburg Conference in 1868 to which England was a 
consenting party I do not think the Transvaal authorities 
were consulted in the matter at that time so possibly they 
might claim to be to a certain extent exempt They have not 
taken advantage of the circumstance An explosive bullet is 
defined to be one in which any missile under 400 grams 
14 ozs is filled with any fulminating or detonating com 
pound No such missile has been employed on either side in 
the present war 
An expanding bullet is quite a different affair There 
are many different forms The hard mantle may be incom 
plete at the top of the bullet allowing the lead core to show 
There may be a cavity extending some way down the bullet 
and open at the top  or the steel or copper nickel envelope 
may be slit down the side of the bullet A common form is 
the softnosed bullet Here the mantleceases a third of 
an inch or so from the point and the lead core projects to that 
extent There is no doubt that softnosed bullets have been 
occasionallybut I believe very rarelyused by the Boers 
Here are specimens picked up in the Boer trenches at Magers 
fontein Note then that an expanding bullet may be 
deliberately made as such or that a properly covered bullet 
may with a little trouble be converted into an expanding 
bullet For sporting purposes expanding bullets are used 
Oddly enough for biggame shooting expanding bullets are 
used because they are considered more humane When used 
in war they are reckoned inhumane The inconsistency 
however is only apparent The sportsmans object is to kill 
his game and not to wound it A wounded animal is likely to 
escape for the time but to die after a long interval if disabled 
for it cannot hold its own in the struggle for existence A 
bullet therefore is required that has a  
stopping 
 
effect 
Now any kind of sporting bullet such as the softnosed bullet 
will if it strikes anything hard break up and deform and 
sometimes if it meets with tough structures such as tendon 
it will also setup in the same way The projecting lead 
core of the softnosed bullet flattens out and the bullet 
assumes more or less a mushroom shape As the bullet is 
rotating while it inflicts the wound the lead is commonly 
twisted in the longitudinal axis and this increases the lia 
bility for fragments to break off The mantle too strips up 
sometimes becoming completely detached from the core 
The torn edges of the hard sheath project Obviously a bul 
let so deformed will lacerate more than when it is intact and 
it injures the tissues over a wider area and clearly too the 
liability to haemorrhage is greatly increased In soft tissues 
therefore the sporting bullet is very destructive and the 
wounds inflicted are very serious 
Confusion arises from the fact that any form of highvelocity 
bullet may exert under certain circumstances an expanding 
or explosive effect Thus if a completely covered bullet 
strikes the shaft of a long bone it will exert an expanding 
action on the bone  but that is a very different thing from its 
being an explosive bullet whether it be a softnosed or split 
bullet or any one of the hundred kinds of sporting bullets 
Again if any form of highvelocity bullet be fired at short 
range into a skull it will burst the skull more or less These 
scattered fragments show the effect as obtained experiment 
ally The skull was filled with plaster and a bullet was fired 
into it just as the plaster was beginning to set and was of 
about the consistency of brain matter On an empty skull no 
such effect will be produced But the explosive action 
in the skull is not due to the explosive or expanding nature 
of the bullet It is due to the high velocity and the extreme 
energy of the bullet not to its particular form a natural bullet 
is just as likely to produce this expanding effect as a soft 
nosed bullet Just the same character of effects is shown in 
the case of the long bones I show some skiagraphs to illus 
trate the point Here the bullet has struck the shaft of the 
humrus pierced it fissured and broken the bone in various 
directions and spread the fragments asunder On the long 
bones an expanding bullet is rather less likely than a normal 
bullet to produce this expanding effect The sporting bullet 
may yet damage a bone more grievously and it will inflict a 
far more lacerated wound It has long been suspected that 
the results obtained by experiments on the dead subject 
would not be borne out in actual practice Experience in this 
campaign has strongly proved the correctness of the surmise 
and the specimens shown furnish evidence of the fact 
Broadly speaking the injuries caused in the living subject 
are less serious than would have been anticipated from experi 
ments In this respect then modern war is more humane 
than it was thought likely tobe 
Skin Wounds 
Mauser bullets commonly make a clean hole or slit through 
the skin and let in practically no air Often it appeared to 
me though the view was questioned by some the bullet 
knocks in a little flap of skin Close examination of a scar 
often reveals a little crescentic mark different from the rest of 
the cicatrix The bullet itself is sterile  attempts to get 
cultivations from it immediately after it has been fired 
have failed It is very unlikely to carry any bits of clothing 
into the wound The only shreds of clothing found in wound 
that I have heard of are bits of the Highlanders kilts another 
argument against that inappropriate and indelicate form of 
clothing Shreds of clothing are very likely to be highly 
septic The Mauser bullet will go through the skin and soft 
parts so cleanly that you cannot tell the apertures of entrance 
from those of exit At a long range the speed of rotation be 
gins to diminish and the bullet begins to wobble while still 
preserving a straight course as it goes through the air It i 
less probable then that the aperture of exit will be identical 
in appearance with that of entrance but in the bulk of case 
you cannot tell one from the other I can recall the case 
of one man who was hit by a crossfire shot in that portion of 
his frame which in the words of Ingoldsby it is considered 
equally indecorous to turn to a friend or a foe  and where if I 
remember right one of the combatants in the famous tri 
angular duel in Mr Midshipman Easy also met with a similar 
injury The patient had four wounds from a single bullet in 
the glu teal region All four scars were absolutely identical 
John Hunter noted that the orifice of exit of a round bullet 
very often healed before the orifice of entrance but I could 
notice no such difference in the wounds I saw 
The question of exploding and expanding bullets is a very 
old one It comes up at every war At Waterloo the French 
were accusedand they of course accused us alsoof using 
cut bullets which broke up in the wounds as you can read in 
Sir H Maxwells Life of the Duke of Wellington The 
same recriminations went on in the Crimean war  
and again in the Franco German war They have been used 
in this campaign there is no question about that for we 
have it on the most unimpeachable authority possibleLord 
Roberts himselfwho would never bring the charge unless 
satisfied by the most irrefragable evidence But I repeat 
for I wish to emphasise the opinion that such forbidden 
bullets have been very rarely used Often no doubt at the 
outset of the campaign extracted bullets were perfectly 
honestly supposed to be of the expanding form when they 
were merely normal bullets that had deformed in striking a 
bone or were possibly ricochet shots Nor have 
4i 
express 
 
and largebore bullets been employed against us save in the 
rarest instances I have seen two or three express bullets 
extracted from patients There is this one enormous difficulty 
 about their use  that an army on active service cannot have

balf a dozen different kinds of rifle ammunition  unless there 
is uniformity of pattern there would be endless confusion 
Such confusion there was in the Crimea when half were 
armed with the Mini rifle socalled though Captain Mini 
did not invent the rifle but only the bullet fired from it and 
half with the old brown Bess 
Injuries of Long Bones  Amputations 
Specimens of bullets which caused fractures and have been 
extracted show that the natural Mauser bullets may be 
deformed and resemble expanding bullets after having struck 
the bone 
Closely bearing on injuries of long bones comes the subject 
of amputations for those injuries The figures of course are 
not yet to hand for this campaign but I believe that the 
results of amputations in this war will be very remarkable 
indeed and contrast in the most marked manner with those 
of former wars In the Peninsular campaign the results were 
fairly good  in the Crimea they reached the lowest ebb I sup 
pose that surgery will ever reach as regards results Out of 
1666 amputations of the thigh done in the French army 1531 
died  the mortality was 9189 per cent The mortality on our 
side was 65 per cent In the American Civil war the mor 
tality after amputations of all kinds was 64 per cent We 
may I think safely anticipate that the mortality in the 
present campaign will at least be twice as low  so it is not 
only the bullet wounds that heal well but also the wounds 
caused by operations Here much more markedly than in 
the case of punctured wounds due to bullets the surgeon is 
favoured by those conditions to which I have already drawn 
attention and of course by the fact that pyaemia osteo 
myelitis and so on are conspicuously absent 
Wounds of Joints 
I can only now allude to the subject of joint wounds though 
these injuries are of vast interest Speaking of the Crimean 
war SurgeonGeneral Sir Thomas Longmore said that not a 
single patient with a wound of the kneejoint recovered with 
his life and his limb If the limb was amputated he had a 
better chance than if conservative treatment was adopted 
But remember 65 per cent of our cases died after amputation 
of the thigh If the limb was not amputated the man died 
of the kneejoint wound In this war I do not think I have 
seen a single death after a kneejoint wound and wounds in 
which the bullet has unquestionably traversed the kneejoint 
are common The bullet nearly always pierces the patella 
cleanly and it appears to me to make little or no difference 
whether the range is short or long I have only Seen one case 
in which it failed to drill a hole through the patella if it 
struck that bone Haemarthrosis usually follows the injury 
Experiment shows that a LeeMetford bullet can go clean 
through the kneejoint in the extended position without in 
juring any of the bones The bullet in one case traversed the 
ligamentum patellae The specimen is of interest for it has 
been denied that a bullet can traverse the joint without in 
juring bone save in the flexed position There is the proof 
that it can Case after case have I seen in which beyond all 
shadow of question the bullet has gone clean through the 
joint and in which recovery has been complete including 
perfect mobility 
 In one extraordinary case a Highlander wounded at Magersfontein 
was shot through the kneejoint There I am bound to say the kilt was 
a convenience to him He fell down saw a hole in his popliteal space 
and saw the blood spurting out His only cover was an ant heap The 
moment he moved he was shot t so he kept still The bleeding had 
ceased spontaneously before he got an opportunity of applying his field 
dressing He had to wait some twentyeight hours before he was picked 
up Helwas brought down to Wynberg a journey of some twentyeight 
hours in the hospital train followed by a drive up hill to the hospital 
There the dressing was removed and immediately blood spurted out very 
vigorously It was found the popliteal artery was wounded The man re 
covered 
Another case I saw where the kneejoint was wounded probably by a 
shrapnel bullet and suppuration followed There was some necrosis 
about the head of the tibia and the suppuration extended into the knee 
joint through a small opening In this case the kneejoint was laid freely 
open and it was found that the whole of the synovial membrane was 
thickened and inflamed looking as if the kneejoint was lined with a layer 
of thick crimson plush I suggested to the surgeon in charge that it 
should be dissected out My hint was taken and I neard some time after 
that the man was making a perfectly good recovery In the history of 
military surgery I do not think you will find many operations of the sort 
recorded Great credit is due therefore to the civil surgeon who per 
formed it I am a little proud of having suggested the proceeding 
Wounds of the Spinal Column and Head 
I did intend to make some remarks about the head cases 
but my time has slipped away and I must trust to be able in 
some future clinical lecture to draw attention to the subject 
But I wish to show you an experimental specimen made by 
firing a bullet at very short range into the spinal column 
The lumbar vertebra is extensively broken up An exploding 
and expanding action has been exercised upon the bone by 
the bullet The astonishing feature of the preparation is that 
it shows how a highvelocity bullet can pass between im 
portant structures without wounding them Here the bullet 
has found its way between the aorta and the vena cava with 
out wounding either Without such evidence as this it would 
have been thought impossible that a bullet travelling at such 
high velocity could cross the track of important nerves or 
vessels without wounding them Nerves I may mention 
will show the most profound effects and lose their functional 
power when a bullet has only passed close by them 
But into so large a subject 1 must not now enter and I only 
allude to such injuries to show how much there is of interest 
in modern rifle bullet wounds I hope to communicate some 
I remarks on nerve injuries to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical 
Society in due course 
Of the head cases I will only say that the question seems to 
be settled altogether that trephining can be done with the 
utmost freedom and with the greatest advantage to the 
patient Never I believe in military surgery have so many 
trephinings been done or with such admirable results as in 
the present campaign Yet trephining is an operation which 
so great an authority as Sir Thomas Longmore thought hardly 
justifiable in military surgery 
Conclusions 
I have given you a very cursoryI fear you will question 
the epithet if I say a briefsketch of some of the features of 
surgical interest in this war Possibly I have adopted too 
pessimistic a tone I am conscious that I have not added my 
voice in any marked degree to the chorus of eulogy that has 
been almost unreservedly lavished on the Army Medical De 
partment during the present campaign I do not hint for a 
moment that such laudation is undeserved It may be that 
I am somewhat of Sir Peter Teazles advice when he remarked 
 
Sir Oliver Sir Oliver this is a damned wicked world  and 
the fewer people we praise the better But in all seriousness 
I dread lest the good surgical results be not ascribed fully 
enough to their proper cause We know the fearful mortality 
brought about by overcrowding and by bad hygienic surround 
ings in the Crimean war and for that matter in the Franco 
German RussoTurkish and other later wars This cam 
paign has already shown that these preventable disasters 
have been traced to their true source Air air pure sunlight 
and air have done more much more for our wounded in this 
war than seems generally to be acknowledged I dread lest 
the Army Medical Department commended and patted on the 
back as it has been and is may relax its efforts to improve 
further If so a terrible awakening is in store for us when 
we next have to face the hideous horrors of war amidst un 
favourable surroundings But if we look on our present ex 
perience just as an indication that we are working in the right 
direction then at least the medical profession may feel that it 
is doingnot that it has doneits best to contribute to the 
humanity of war 
Lest we forget 
Women Graduates in ItalyAccording to the Riforma 
Medica the number of women who have taken degrees in one 
or other of the faculties in Italian Universities from 1870 to 
1897 is 129 Of these 64 graduated in arts 15 in medicine and 
surgery 15 in physical science 14 in mathematics 7 in 
philosophy and 4 in law Of the sweet girlgraduates in 
medicine 3 obtained their degrees at Naples 3 at Rome 3 at 
Bologna 2 at Turin while Palermo Pavia Florence and Pisa 
were each favoured by 1 In the academic year 189899 the 
number of women on the books of the various universities was 
261 Of these 37 were registered as students of medicine and 
9 as students of pharmacy Of the medical students Florence 
and Turin had 7 and Rome and Genoa 5 each Pavia 4 Naples 
and Catania 2 apiece Parma 1 Messina 1 and Cagliari 1
