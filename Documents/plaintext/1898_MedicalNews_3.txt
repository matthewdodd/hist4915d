MENCAL WAR NEWS 
OUTBREAK OF YELLOW FEVER IN THE AMERICAN ARMY IN 
CUBA 
IT is officially admitted by the Washington authorities that 
yellow fever lhas broken out in the American force besieging 
Santiago The correspondent of the Times telegraphing on 
July I3th says that while there are I4 admitted cases of yellow 
fever the whole number open to suspicion is nearly IoO Sur 
geons and experts eonsidered competent have been on the spotl 
since the army landed but no decisive measures were adopted 
till General Miles landed Isolated hospitals have now been 
established and all the prescribed steps have been taken to 
prevent the spread of the disease but grave anxiety is con 
fessed General Shafter telegraphs that the refugees from 
Santiago are starving at El Caney The number given is 
i8ooo who depend on such rations as can be spared from the 
none too ample army stores Some are dead and others dying 
and the condition of the whole is precarious in the extreme 
Yet these starving wretehes from a feverstricken city were 
for days allowed to mingle with the American troops and 
wander about the camps Yellow fever was alleged to exist 
in Santiago before they left Now a cordon is drawn about 
El Caney after the misehief is done 
Immediately on landing in Cuba General Miles ordered 
Siboney to be burnt for sanitary reasons It is stated that 
yellow fever stations will be established on some of the quays 
off Florida to which a special vessel will convey fever patients 
direct from Santiago 
THE SICK AND WOUNDED AT SANTIAGO 
Telegraphing to the American Secretary for War on July 8th 
General Shafter said  The men are in good spirits and are 
making themselves more secure every hour The wounds are 
much less dangerous than similar wounds with the ealibre 45 
Among the large number of wounded are few amputations 
perhaps ten General health of command is good One 
hundred and fifty cases of fever which runs its course in four 
or five days but not serious 
An unofficial account states that the reports of the surgeons 
on the injuries inflicted during the recent fighting show that 
the small calibre bullets almost invariably proved fatal in 
cases of penetration of the abdomen their action being ex 
plosive Otherwise theywere humane enough the deaths being 
fewer than if thewounds had been inflicted by larger projectiles 
A greater proportion of the bullets lodged in the body than 
could have been expected possibly on account of the poor 
quality of the powder or through the reduction of the initial 
velocity by the surrounding thiekets 
The hospital arrangements for the American army are said 
to be steadily improving Forty ambulances are now in ser 
vice and there are many empty tents As the wounded are 
nearly all at Juragua the headquarters hospital has been 
cleared in expectation of the next assault The sick list is 
increasing rapidly and the officers are hoping for a speedy 
termination of the siege before the troops begin to suffer 
seriously from the ravages of the elimate 
The hospital ship IRelzef with a large corps of surgeons and 
nurses and ample medical stores has arrived at Playa del Este 
Mrs Porter the wife of President MIcKinleys secretary is one 
of the nurses 
THE  MUTILATION CAUJSED BY THE MAUSER RIFLES 
Admiral Sampson announced after the fight at Guantanamo 
that the bodies of the marines killed there had been  horribly 
mutilated by the enemy Naturally this statement caused 
great indignation in the United States but it was receivedl 
with reserve by Europeans who knew that Spaniards what 
ever may be their shortcomings are not savages This 
scepticism has been fully justified by the report of Surgeolk 
Van Reypen that the appearance of mutilation was due to 
the character of the bullets in the Mauser rifles used by the 
Spanish and by a subsequent report of the Admiral himself 
in which he admits that a careful investigation has been 
made and it is reported to me that apparent mutilation was 
probably due to the effect of short ranges and I withdraw the 
clharge of mutilation But in the inflammable state of the 
American mind the Admirals withdrawal will probably not 
avail to nullify the effect of the unfounded charge and we 
heartily agree with Dr Frank Donaldson the special war cor

respondent of the Philadelphia Medical Journal that the 
careful investigation referred to in Admiral Sampsons 
later message should have been made before and not after 
the original accusation 
TME X RAYS IN NAVAL SURGERY 
On board the hospital ship Relief a description of wlich 
was given in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of June i 8th p I620 
there are two X ray installations There is also a dark room 
for photographic work This department is under the charge 
of Dr William M Gray the plhotograplhic expert of the Sur 
geonGenerals Library at Washinlgton It is his intention 
to take a photograplh of the entrance and exit of tlle bullet in 
all cases of bullet injuries as well as a skiagrapli and to pre 
serve a complete series of plates for future study Dr Gray 
has also in his laboratory an electric drill and saw and small 
lamps for the illumination of cavities etc as well as micro 
scopes and other necessary instruments for the study of 
blood bacteria etc 
THE DANGER OF YELLOW FEVER IN CUBA 
SurgeonGeneral Sternberg has written as follows to tlle 
Army and Navy Journal regarding the danlger of yellow fever 
in Cuba 
In your issue of April 23rd p 642 the statement is made that General 
Sternberg  expresses confidence in the excellent sanitary provisions of the 
military service and does not fear that yellow fever will prove more 
harmful to the troops tlhan diseases wlhichl are common in the niorthern 
latitudes etc T have not expressed any such optimistic opinion and 
regret to say that it is not justified either by my studies relating to yel 
low fever or by my personal experience History teaches that when a 
considerable number of unprotected persons are exposed in a yellow 
feverinfected locality during the months when the disease is most preva 
lent May ist to November ist in the latitude of Havana an epidemic 
most infallibly results In the last week of April of last year there were 
x7 deaths and 7o new cases of yellow fever in the city of Havana Now 
suppose that we had a similar number of cases at the same season in New 
Orleans and that 20000 straiigers from the nortlh should go there to spend 
the summer what would be the result  All past expelience supports the 
belief that a majority of them would have yellow fever and that from 20 
to 40per cent of those taken sick would die This is what I anticipate 
would happen if we should send an army to occupy Havana or any other 
infected seaport on the coast of Cuba during the summer months If 
however these troops could be camped upon high land in the interior 
and circumstances were such as to enable them to coiimply with all of the 
extractions of modern sanitary science I am of opinion that our loss 
from yellow fever would not be serious But in time of war military com 
mnanders are expected to take their troops to the points occupied by the 
enemy and a picnic in the interior with frequent changes of camp etc 
is perhaps not exactly what we may expect I aiml not an alarmist but I 
believe in looking facts clearly in the face and cannot allow your state 
inent of my opinion to have currency at suchi an important moment in 
our countrys history without a protest 
MILITARY HOSPITALS OF CUBA 
At the meeting of the International Congress of Hygiene 
and Demography held in Madrid last Easter Dr A de Larra 
Cerezo read a paper on the Military Hospitals of the Island of 
Cuba and particularly of the Hospital Alphonso XIII in 
Havana during the war which has since been republished 
in book form In February I895 when the insurrection 
broke out there were only 2500 beds Hospitals have since 
been built in every province of the island and in January 
I898 there was accommodation for 45655 patients There 
are eleven hospitals containing more than iooo beds each 
The larger ones are the Royal with 5ooo beds Alfonso XIII 
with 3000 Manzanillo with 3000 Beneficienza with 2100 
Santiago with 2ooo Sancti Spiritus with 2000 Ciego with 
1700 Cienfuegos with I450 Remedios with 1400 Holguin 
with I300 Madera with IIOO All these are said to be well 
supplied with instruments and medical necessaries of every 
description and each has also a perfectly equipped laboratory 
In addition to the ordinary sanitary ambulance corps a 
service of carriages is provided for the rapid conveyance of 
the wounded to the base hospitals in Havana Santiago 
Matanzas Santa Clara Manzanillo Sagua la Grande Trinidad 
and Cienfuegos 
Three of the best steamers of the Compania Transatlantica 
Espafiola the Alicante the Montserrat and the San Ignaoio 
Loyola were especially fitted up as hospital ships and contain 
four large wards of 96 beds each four small isolation wards 
and surgical wards for operations The ships are lighted all 
over with electricity To insure a supply of fresh air the port 
holes are kept open when weather permits and there are as 
well a number of large air pumps Each vessel carries a large 
quantity of drugs baths are also provided while for the con 
valeseelnt there is a large and comfortably furnished saloon 
On the three ships accommodation is found for I500 patients 
During the first two years after the erection of the hospital of 
Alfonso XIII 8oooo patierts were admitted into its wards 
and more than a thousand operations were performed In 1897 
the third year of its existenee fewer patients were treated 
and at the same time the rate of inortality decreased This 
diminished deathrate is ascribed to increased hospital space 
for each patient whieh is secured by the early removal of 
convaleseents to the annexe and hospital ships The 
number of sick from March to December i895 was 49485 
with 3200 deaths In I896 the number of sicek was 23274 
with I06io deaths from January to June 1897 there were 
201247 with 369I deatlhs Yellow fever headed the list of 
diseases The wounded admitted to hospitals during the 
period aforesaid numbered I I912 distributed according to 
year as follows 1895 I189 I896 7270 I897 2643 The 
number of deaths was 523 The total mortality counting both 
sick and wounded from March I895 to June I897 was 22497 
The total number of deaths among medical officers in the 
hospital service of the army and navy since the beginning of 
the rebellion has been 50 of which number more than two 
thirds have been the victims of yellow fever 
LITERARY NOTES 
WE are pleased to note that Dr Beattie Croziers Civil List 
pension of 5o has been increased to ioo in order to enable 
him to complete his great work The History of Intellectual 
Development on the Lines of Modern Evolution the first volume 
of which appeared in 1897 
In the July number of the Phonographic Record Sir Wnm 
Gowers has an interesting and valuable communicationi upon 
an obscure form of chorea Dr Fletcher Beach discourses 
ably upon mentally deficient children while the troubles 
and trials of the assistant and the locum tenens have a sym 
pathetic exponent in Dr Lamming Burton 
Dr G Sims Woodheads paper entitled Experiments on 
Living Animals reprinted from the Medical Ma azine is 
written in a frank and manly spirit and is one oi7 the best 
replies to the antivivisectors that we have read He says that 
in the many experiments whieh he has seen performed he 
has met at most only two experimenters who have not 
taken every possible precaution to minimise not pain merely 
but even discomfort to the animal under experiment He 
adds that  it is deemed essential that an animal should be 
spared all unnecessary pain not from fear of the legal conse 
quences but on purely moral and ethical grounds He gives 
some striking proofs of the much lower degree of sensitiveness 
to pain possessed by animals even so high in the scale as the 
horse and dog as compared with human beings He gives 
the following remarkable illustration of the inconsistencies to 
which the antiscientifie bias may lead its victims 
One wellknowni lady who is supposed to hold strong views against 
vivisectors is said to have remarked or even written tllat the sacrifice 
of many women for the sake of gratifying and developing the genius of 
one man like Byron was more than justifiable and that women so sacri 
ficed should feel honoured Wlhatever one may think of such liysterical 
balderdash one is scarcely prepared to find the same lady argiiing that 
man has no riglht to subject animals to pain or discomfort under any cir 
cumstances whatever 
According to a writer in a recent number of Appletons 
Popular Science Monthly the eustom of trephininc was much 
practised in prehistoric times as the skulls of these remote 
periods show and is still in vogue among some peoples 
Among these are the people of the Berber stock in the Djebel 
AurPs and the Djebel Chechar of the edges of the Algerian 
plateau The method of performing tIme operation is care 
fully described by Drs H Malbot and R Verneau The 
former was shown by a native doctor a skull with more than 
a dozen circular holes two slits and a large irregular orifice 
all of which had been made when the man was alive The 
skull was kept hidden and was evidently used as an example 
by the local doctors The natives have recourse to trepanning 
for blows or wounds on the head and it does not matter how 
long before the blow may have been given if only the sick 
person can remember that he has had one The operation is 
not severe A woman tired of her husband is said to have 
called in the service of a trepanner in order to get a divorce 
from him by producing a piece of her skull and affirming 
that he had broken it in some of his cruel acts
