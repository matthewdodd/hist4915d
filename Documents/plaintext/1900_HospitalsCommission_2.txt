Other experiments referred to were those of Mr H 
Crouch upon the action of chloroform Stress was laid 
on the fact that the really serious symptom in threa 
tened death by chloroform was cardiac failure not re 
spiratory failure The great fall in blood pressure caused 
by the inhalation of chloroform was shown by plethysmo 
graphic records to be due chiefly to cardiac enfeeblement A 
further point whicn may prove of great value was that amyl 
nitrite appeared to act in some respects as an antidote to the 
cardiac action of chloroform In an animal to which amyl 
nitrite had been previously administered chloroform no longer 
gave the great fall in blood pressure 
SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS COMMISSION 
At the first meeting of the Commission held on July 24th 
after the opening statement by the Chairman Lord Justice 
Romer which was published in the British Medical Journal 
of July 28th the first evidence taken was that of the Director 
General of the Army Medical Service who gave particulars of 
the working of his department and the arrangements made 
in time of peace for future wars He said that every demand 
made for South Africa up to date had been met There had 
been ample supplies of doctors nurses beds and medical 
appliances  but he could not say whether the doctors and 
appliances sent out had been properly distributed He had 
not in his official capacity received any complaints of any 
special hospital Next came the AssistantDirector of the 
Army Medical Service who stated that the medical service 
was in respect of transport at the mercy of the Army Service 
Corps or rather of the General After some further evidence 
from departmental officials LieutenantColonel G Sterling 
Ryerson of the Canadian Army Medical Staff expressed the 
firm conviction that the best that was possible in the circum 
stances was done for the sick and wounded 
At the second sitting on July 25th the Rev W H Orford 
who was attached to a hospital in Bloemfontein said there 
was no overcrowding The nursing was all done by orderlies 
who worked splendidly He had never heard any complaint 
from the men either at the hospital where he was for two 
months or at two others in which he was With regard to 
vermin he said that if a new brick building was put up even 
upon new ground in South Africa it was immediately infested 
Sir Howard Vincent MP who visited several hospitals said 
the arrangements were beyond all praise He heard no com 
plaints even from the men of his own regiment who would 
have spoken freely to him Mr Watson Cheyne also spoke 
well of the medical arrangements He was inclined to think 
the epidemic was not typhoid or atleast that a great deal of 
camp fever had been mixed up with typhoid No neglect of 
the sick or wounded came under his notice An immenee 
amount of the energies of the medical staff was wasted in ad 
ministrative and clerical work Next came a trooper of the 
CIV who had himself been in hospital and who said that as 
far as he knew there was no want of attention either at Bloem 
fontein or at Wynberg A full report of the evidence is given 
below 
SurgeonGeneral J J Jameson DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical 
Service said that with regard to the constitution of the department in 
reference to preparing for the care of sick and wounded there was a per 
sonnel of officers and men for two army corps and a cavalry brigade In 
ease of war being threatened the AdjutantGeneral communicated with 
witness stating where the war was to be and the strength likely to be 
engaged He was then desired to submit a proposal which would after 
wards be discussed by the Army Board as to the medical requirements 
Including the percentage of beds required In unhealthy climates the 
estimate ranged from 10 per cent to 25 per cent of the total strength 
Then he prepared a memorandum showing the probable diseases likely 
to be encountered the kind of supplies and provisions to be obtained 
and everything connected with the sanitary part of the campaign He 
also furnished all the medical officers engaged with a memorandum 
showing them what diseases they would have to contend with and how to 
obviate them and the necessary sanitary precautions The memorandum 
which had been prepared for the present war dealt with temperature 
rainfall winds precautions required on account of climate and the 
following prevailing diseases Enteric fever dysentery diarrhoea 
malarial fevers parasitic diseases ophthalmia and pneumonia Imme 
diately the war broke out it was found that the medical personnel for 
two army corps and a cavalry brigade were exhausted The number 
of medical officers in South Africa on September ist 1899 was 32 
During September 19 were sent out in October 138 in November 102 
in December 38 in January 1900 44 in February 48 in March 50 
in April 10 in May 8 and in June 19 making a total of 508 This month 
20 more were being sent out The figures did not include the medical 
I officers of colonial contingents Every demand for South Africa up to 
I date had been met There had been ample supplies for the sick and 
I wounded of doctors nurses beds and medical appliances He could note 
I say whether the doctors and appliaDces sent out were rightly distributed 
I in South Africa He then read the following note on the state of the sick 
and wounded at Bloemfontein on April 27th Mr BurdettCoutts de 
scribed the condition of a field hospital at Bloemtontein which he con 
siders should have been equipped as a stationary hospital His descrip 
tion relates to April 28th On April 27th there were at Bloemfontein the fol 
lowing fully equipped hospitalsNos 8 9 and 10 General Hospitals the 
Langman the Portland the Irish and No 5 Stationaryabout 2000 beds 
in all with considerable capacity for extension There were altogether 
2291 patients in military hospitals at that date 873 being cases of enteric 
There were about six field hospitals of which all but one had to be pre 
pared for war at anytimeNone of the returns describe any want of 
satisfaction with the arrangements He had not received in his official 
capacity any complaints of any special hospital and only an unofficial1 
complaint with regard to the Woodstock Hospital 
Lieutenant Colonel Johnson Assistant Director of the AMS gave 
details as to sending out of hospitals and nurses and pointed out the 
great distinction between military hospitals and civil hospitals He 
I added that the medical service had not its own transport which was per 
haps a weak point in its organisation They were at the mercy of the 
Army Service Corps or rather of the General 
Major W G Macpherson Deputy Assistant Director AMS gave 
statistics and returDS with regard to sanitary matters and also dealt 
with the actual extent of the outbreak of enteric and other diseases in the 
army and the preventive measures adopted in the present war He said 
I it was intended to supply Berkefeld filters in the proportion of x to every 
I 100 men but that had not been completely carried out because the 
I manufacturers were unable to fulfil their contract The hospital system 
I depended on its ability to constantly remove patients from the field hos 
Eitals 
to the base hospitals and thence to the transports There had 
een no delay in emptydg the base hospitals As many as 2coo men a 
I week had been landed in this country Up to July 17th 26758 men had 
I been invalided home The deaths reported from enteric were now going 
I back to the normal point The deaths for the week ended July 14t 
I would represent 38 per cent per annum The deaths reached their maxi 
I mum on May 26th The medical officer in charge of No 9 General Hos 
pital at Bloemfontein drew attention to 1000 cases of enteric fever up to 
the date on which he wrote with a casemortality of 12 per cent 
LieutenantColonel J S Cowans DeputyAssistantQuartermaster 
General gave details as to transport and said every requisition for extra 
medical men had been complied with 
General Sir Henry Brackenbury DirectorGeneral of Ordnance 
stated that he was charged with supplying allarms and armaments neces 
sary for the conduct of war together with hospital equipment including 
tents beds bedding stretchers and waggons but not medical or surgical 
stores He was not aware of any complaint having been received From 
South Africa as to either insufficiency or quality of the hospital equip 
ment In his opinion the reserve of hospital equipment previous to the 
outbreak of the war was totally inadequate There was to his mind a 
great lesson to be learned at home as to the necessity of having in hand a 
very large reserve so as to be able to meet all demands during the first 
six months of a campaign so as to be independent of the  trades He dicD 
not think however that the slightest suffering had been caused to the 
troops by such delays as had occurred The wituess then gave particulars 
as to the hospital arrangements prevailing at home in peace time The 
army was organised into certain units and each had its stores and hos 
pital equipment at the centre of mobilisation In addition there was the 
question of reserves  and as a matter of fact just before the war broke 
out they had a reserve of only one base hospital of 520 beds and two 
1 stationary hospitals of no beds each That was on September 29th when 
the Government gave orders for preparations to be made to send out 
additional equipment There were at that time sufficient stores for field 
hospitals for three army corps but they had no reserve equipment for 
stationary hospitals or base hospitals except those already mentioned 
Colonel J Steevens CB Principal Ordnance Officerwho was next called 
said that he did not receive orders to proceed with the preparations 
until October 4th Directly the order was given he set men to work day 
and night filling beds with horsehair that had to be purchased hurriedly 
and in that way they were able to send the equipment by the transport 
on the date fixed There was one delay in sending out base hospitals 
from December 9th to January 6th That was owing to their having sent 
out all the ambulance waggons they possessed They received during 
March a message to send out 300 beds and bedding and while that order 
was being carried out the War Office ordered 2oco beds to be despatched 
to South Africa  both requests were complied with as quickly as possible 
Delay had arisen in a case in which 500 beds of a particular pattern were 
requested  and it was found necessary to import them which in his 
opinion was a mistake  
Sir Ralph Knox Permanent Undersecretary for War said the Army 
Medical Department had no executive authority but according to what 
was required in the field had to go to one of the four high military officers 
of the War Officeeither the AdjutantGeneral the Quartermaster 
General the Inspector General of Fortifications or the Director 
General of Ordnance and while speaking generally all its 
applications were granted they were usually referred to the Army 
Board The preparations of all the responsible departments were 
based on the assumption that for a war of attack or of defence 
it was necessary to send out two army corps and a ravalry division 
giving an aggregate of about 90000 men At the same time their prepara 
tions were framed in respect of a third army corps at home but they 
were on a more moderate scale Replying to a question respecting the 
delay in getting the base hospitals ready the witness said that as a matter 
of fact the Government had not in July or even in August made up its 
mind as to what would have to be done As to suggestions or complaints 
of delay or insufficiency of hospital equipment and transport for hos 
tal 
purposes the fact was that the Army Medical Department desired 
hat all medical matters in the field should be under their direct control 
and in a large measure that was so in the present campaign Of course 
the difficulties of transport had to be taken into account and the main 
transport had to be maintained even though the medical transport suft

Cered in consequence So far as he was aware the War Office had not 
received any complaints respecting the management of the hospitals 
beyond those contained in Mr BurdettCouttss letters 
LieutenantColonel G Sterling Ryerson Canadian Army Medical Staff 
Toronto stated that he was in South Africa from February 15th to July 
44th in the capacity of Red Cross Commissioner and his services ranged 
over a wide area first commencing at the Orange River and then 
including work in the hospitals at Kimberley Bloemfontein and Kroon 
stadt At the first place on February 20th he found between 500 
end 700 sick and wounded chiefly i a adjustable huts but some were 
in tents All appeared extremely comfortable as regards beds bedding 
and medical and general stores There were 47 Canadians in the 
hospital and if they had had anything to complain of they would 
have told him From Orange River he went on to Kimberley and 
remained three or four weeks visiting the hospitals daily The Modder 
Bridge had been destroyed and it was therefore difficult to get supplies 
p owing to the convoys having to traverse steep declivities which really 
resembled toboggan slides or chutes and a whole day was occupied in 
overing the forty miles from Orange River On one day 523 sick and 
wounded arrived at Kimberley With so large a number of men suddenly 
thrown upon them it was impossible to provide them with such luxury 
as was obtainable at say the Hotel Cecil  but they had all that was neces 
sary to render them as comfortable as was possible in the circumstances 
He himself furnished 90 cots from the Red Cross funds the cots being 
made by the De Beers Company There was abundant medical and nursing 
strength and the hospital stores were well supplied except in respect of 
fresh milk which was very scarce He next proceeded to Bloemfontein 
And Kroonstadt At the former place there were between 3000 and 4000 
sick and nothing could have surpassed the arrangements made in Parlia 
ment Buildings for the comfort of the men after the first week or two 
while in the Roman Catholic Convent and St Michaels Home everything 
was perfection and the nuns made splendid nurses It should be borne 
in mind that the communications had been cut and that there was only a 
single line of railway to convey supplies for about 50000 men and that 
three days and three nights were occupied in the journeys which were 
usually covered in forty hours Notwithstanding all these difficulties he 
saw nothing to complain of There were plenty of stores and the hospitals 
rere at liberty to draw upon the Red Cross without restraint The number 
of men arriving was extraordinary  one afternoon 564 arrived and the 
next morning another 354 What would the London hospitals do if 10000 
patients were suddenly thrown upon them  He was firmly convinced 
that the best that was possible in the circumstances was done for the sick 
and wounded although he had not read the letters referred to he remem 
bered seeing Mr BurdettContts in Bloemfontein but did not hear of any 
complaints being made to him 
At the second sitting of tne Commission held on July 25th the Rev 
W H Orford said he was born in South Africa and was in Bloemfontein 
from the entrance of the British troops until Lord Roberts went north 
He was mainly attached to the hospital which was established in his old 
college of St Andrews It was undoubtedly one of the worst in the 
district because it was an old building and was one of those chiefly 
criticised It was quite true that patients were lying on stretchers and 
mattresses and in some cases it was impossible to undress them for a 
fortnight There was no overcrowding There were about 60 patients 
in the hospital but there were no nurses The nursing work was all done 
toy orderlies who did their work splendidly The greatest difficulty they 
had was in getting fresh milk The food was of good quality They had 
sufficient blankets He had never heard a word of complaint from the men 
though he had constantly asked them if there was anything they wanted 
In reply to the Chairman the witness said there was only one par 
ticular in which they missed the nurses and that was that the men did 
not obey the orderlies so well as they did the nurses He was nearly two 
months in the hospital but the condition of things he had described 
lasted only about a fortnight  within that time they got everything they 
wanted He was in two other hospitals There was very little difference 
toetween these two hospitals and the one he first mentioned tie had 
never heard any complaint about these two hospitals He was not con 
nected officially with any hospital but he was acting chaplain and in 
that capacity was a person the men were likely to confide in He had 
never seen any men lying in the mud and had no reason to believe that 
oldiers refrained from complaining lest they should get into trouble 
In reply to Mr Frederick Harrison the witness said the wounded came 
crowding in from Paardeberg He did net see men lying about when they 
first came in though he heard that men were lying about for thirtysix 
fiours up the Glen but fighting was actually going on He believed the 
removal could not be managed for military reasons He had often slept 
on the ground himself without a mattress In answer to further ques 
tions the witness referred to the question of vermin and insects in South 
Africa and said that if a new brick building was put up even upon new 
round it might immediately be infested He went on to point out that 
the Bloemfontein Waterworks had never yet been completed The filter 
beds had never been finished and they did not depend upon them for 
their water supply In a very short time after the occupation the engi 
neers had bored all round the town and good water was found at a 
depth of 50 feet and taken to the hospitals 
Sir Howard Vincent MR who was the next witness stated that he 
arrived in South Africa on January 23rd and visited in the first place the 
Portland Hospital in the suburbs of Capetown on the 25th He thought 
it was admirably arranged in every way He passed on to No 3 General 
Hospital one of the large general hospitals which had accommodation 
for about 500 or 600 patients He went thoroughly through that hospital 
and saw the cooking operations and conversed with many of the 
patients In no hospital marquee were there more than x6 patients As 
to the general cleanliness order and comfort of the hospital it was 
beyond all praise and he heard absolutely of no complaints He subse 
quently made a full examination of No 1 General Hospital at Wynberg 
He saw the reception of the patients He was struck with the extraor 
dinary method Colonel Grier had established in order to trace out not 
only the medical but the private history of each man Although he 
might seem to speak in terms of exaggeration he could only say that the 
Arrangements were beyond all praise He did not hesitate to say that 
from the laymans point of view overcrowding was much less than be had 
een in any London hospital He went into the Boer hospital ward and 
there he received the only complaint made and that was 
Commandant Pretorius He also visited No 2 Hospital close by 
on the same day and again on March 5th when he was quite 
alone He said there were two men of his own regiment in the 
hospital and he conversed with them and they would no doubt 
have spoken to him if they had had complaints to make On February 
14th he had an opportunity of going round the whole of Sir Kedvers 
Bullert army and seeing the provision made for taking away the 
wounded from the fighting line Everything was done that could pos 
sibly be done and it was remarkable to see with what skill the medical 
department took up their dressing stations There was however always 
a tendency on the part of bearers to linger a little when they got tired 
As to the red cross on the waggons he did not think it was sufficient in 
dication as it was difficult to see it at a long range The Boers painted 
their ambulance trains white He was at Chieveley the best part of a 
week and he went amongst the officers and men and it would be impos 
sible on anything he heard to found any substantial complaint Then he 
visited Sir William Gatacres column at Sterkstroom There typhoid was 
very prevalent and there were three or four wards of bad enteric cases 
He did not ascertain that there was any real cause of complaint that 
could be avoided He arrived at Paardeberg on February 27th He was 
able to see the hospitals there and also the arrangements for carry 
ing the wounded from Paardeberg to Modder River and he was bound to 
say that it was to be regretted that the number of ambulances in the 
bearer company were reduced in order to obtain extra mobility The 
complement of the bearer company was ten ambulances and these were 
reduced by the exigencies of the moment to two That was a very bad 
time because a convoy had just been captured by the Boers and there 
was great pressure He visited the general hospital at Kimberley and it 
was as good as any hospital in London After leaving Kimberley he 
again visited the hospitals in Capetown and he heard no complaints 
from any of the men in his own regiment or the members of the CIV 
who all perfectly well knew that he went out to see if he could do any 
thing to improve their condition Taking all the exigencies of the case 
into consideration he could not speak too highly as to the general 
arrangements 
Mr Watson Cheynesaid that he had visited several military hospitals 
in South Africa There was no real trouble about the sick and wounded 
Of course there was overcrowding in the field hospitals and they were 
short of equipment The sick were attended to and were being sent back 
to the base hospital Being out in the open did not affect the patients a 
bit for it was a beautiful time of the year They ran rather short of 
dressings but the medical comforts were all right The only hardship 
was the long distance the men had to be sent back in ox waggons They 
could not expect a large proportion of army medical men to be good 
surgeons any more than among civilian surgeons As to the orderlies it 
was generally remarked that the St John Ambulance men were not good 
owing to their want of training but the surgeons and noncommissioned 
officers were very good The witness went on to say that at Drietfontein 
they had proof that the ambulances were insufficient in numbers 
Ambulances had been left behind partly in consequence of the exi 
gencies of the advance and partly in the hope that they would 
not be required He was at Bloemfontein till April 20th or 21st 
During the greater part of that time the enteric epidemic was at its 
worst but he believed there were more cases in May Within 
fiveldays of reaching Bloemfontein Colonel Stevenson had arranged accom 
modation for 500 or 600 sick He called in once or twice to see cases in the 
tents They were as crowded as they could be About April 20th they had 
had over 300 deaths in a 50bed hospital He went away then for a few 
weeks and when he returned there had been 400 There was a point which 
he thought the medical members of the Commission might consider and 
that was how far this epidemic was one of typhoid fever The great 
majority of cases recovered in ten days or a fortnight and there were 
other characteristics which made him think it was not typhoid As soon 
as Bloemfontein was left there were hardly any cases but at Kroonstadt it 
broke out again The great bulk of the cases occurred about ten days 
after Paardeberg but he thought a great deal of camp fever had been 
mixed up with typhoid There were two or three nights when it poured 
with rain with the result that tents were flooded The Portland Hospital 
was certainly flooded but he did not think there were any men in it at 
the time He had seen men lying on the ground but never in the mud 
He had never heard of a man who did not get the rations prescribed for 
him He had heard the story of orderlies selling the food to the patients 
but no soldier had ever complained to him of such a thing He thought 
I they would certainly have complained if they had such a grievance He 
I thought all the men knew who he was He started without a uniform but 
I he found it was very inconvenient as he was constantly being arrested for 
I going to places where it was thought he ought not to have gone The 
I soldiers out there all understood the difficulties of the situation and he 
I did not think anything was left undone He thought everyone 
I tried to do his best in fact they were very enthusiastic in 
I their endeavours to maintain the reputation which they believed 
I the Army Medical Service had acquired The orderlies did their 
I best Many of them were untrained men and if their best was 
I not good that was another matter There was a great deal of 
I sickness among the orderlies themselves No neglect of the sick and 
I wounded came under his notice in any way In answer to Dr Church the 
I witness added that in his opinion an unnecessary amount of the time of 
I the medical staff was taken up in administrative and clerical work which 
I clerks ought to be employed to do It took something like two hours 
I every day to clear off the medical reports and returns An immense 
I amount of energy was wasted in this way 
I Mr Morgan a trooper of the City Imperial Volunteer Mounted Infantry 
I lately returned from South Africa said he fell sick at S annas Post He 
I was treated with every possible kindness at Bloemfontein The medical 
I staff did the best they could for the men when they got into No 9 General 
I Hospital So far as he knew there was no want of attention During the 
I eight days he was there the doctor visited him twice a day and there were 
I nurses and orderlies He was also in hospital at Wynberg about four or 
I five days He was very much astonished at the amount of attention given 
I to them He never heard anyone complaining out there Everyone had 
I spoken well of the medical men who attended them and be had heard no 
I complaint of the want of medical comforts
