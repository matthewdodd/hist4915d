DEO 9 qg8991 PHYSICAL STANDARD FOR ADMISSION TO THE ARMY  Tv z6i 5 IKwlw 
the superintendent of the laboratory should be a professed 
pathologist and not a physician or surgeon in practice and 
that thtrefore the remuneration to be paid him should be on 
a higher scale than is usual with hospital appointments As 
pathologist and curator of the museum the holder of the office 
will receive 250 a year and since he will also be lecturer in 
pathology to the medieal school a certain sum will further 
accrue to him from the fees 
In requiring that the holder of the office should be a pro 
fessed pathologist the Governors have taken a step as yet 
taken by few of the London hospitals but it is held to be 
advisable from the poiint of view of the patients the hospital 
staff and the reputation of the hospital and school and one 
which has been shown to work admirably in the case of the 
Johns Hopkins Hospital at Baltimore to cite the most notable 
example 
Dr LazarusBarlow has been elected to fill the office thus 
created and since he has already had over seven years experi 
ence in pathology as Nmonstrator of Pathology at Cambridge 
University and Curator of the Museum and Demonstrator of 
Morbid Anatomy at St Georges Hospital his appointment 
will doubtless justify the expectations of the Governors with 
regard to the new departure that they have taken 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CAPETOWN 
November 15th 
THE BOER WOUNDED 
THEttransport Patiahz arrived from Natal yesterday with 87 
Boer prisoners of whom about twenty were wounded and 
were sent on to No I eneral Hiospital at Wynberg The rest 
went in the usual course to the prison ship Peneloge at 
Simons Town The wounded men were landed at the Cape 
town Docks and thence conveyed by train direct to Wynberg 
Station I have not as yet had an opportunity of examining 
the injured men but from what I saw of them as they were 
being landed I should say that none of the injuries are very 
severe only s were stretcher cases the rest being quite able 
to walk As in the case of the British wounded to whom I 
referred last week most of them appeared to be hit in the 
extremities Two Boer surgeons Drs Sharpe and Marais 
accompanied them 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR REMOVAL OF WOUNDED TO WYNBERG 
HOSPITAL 0 
The local centre of the St John Ambulance has got into 
working order a scheme for affording assistance en route to 
the sick conveyed from the Docks to the General Hospital 
At the Docks where the men are entrained it has a trained 
nurse with three lady assistants and at Wynberg Station 
where they are detrained for conveyance by ambulance 
waggon to the hospital a trained nurse with 5 lady assistants 
A waiting room is provided at each place with a paraffin 
stove and light refreshments such as bovril milk tea coffee 
cocoa and a8rated waters with stimulants Lounges and 
chairs are fixed up in each dep6t and they furnish not only a 
place where the men can be kept in privacy but the oppor 
tunity of a little refreshment before the journey is under 
taken At Wynberg the advantage of this provision is 
obvious as the hospital is fully a mile distant and the 
ambulance waggons can only convey about twentyfour each 
journey so that a number must always have to remain in 
waiting for a time The bearer detachment of the Association 
has not yet been made use of hut is ready wheneverrequired 
Very much more voluntary aid is available but the authori 
ties have for the present declined it 
THE GOOD HOPE SOCIETY 
The Good Hope Society which has been formed for the 
purpose of providing siek and wounded with extraregulation 
comforts is meeting with enthusiastic support Mrs 
Hanbury Williams the chatelaine of Government House 
being the moving spirit It is supplying such things as 
flowers literature fruit tobacco and cigarettes easy chairs 
lounges etc 
THE SYMPATHY OF THE  BROWN PEOPLE 
In connection with this a very touching instance of the 
quiet sympathy of the coloured people ought to be men 
tioned A largelyattended meeting of coloured men was 
held at Stellenbosch a very hot Bond centre but where the 
Brown people are enthusiastically loyal to consider the best 
way of helping the Imperial authorities and it was decided 
to forward regularly supplies of strawberries and other fruit 
to the hospital Stellenbosch is a large fruitproducing 
centre arid most of the coloured folk have their little gardens 
No white man was present at the meeting and the action 
was absolutely spontaneous 
OFFER OF A HOSPITAL AT STELLENBOSCH 
The loyal whites held a meeting at the same place and 
decided to offer theGeneral a hall fully equipped as a hospital 
with 12 beds and provided with nursing staff Dr Versfeld 
agreeing to give his services as surgeon All was to be done 
at the expense of the community Whether this kind offer 
will be accepted I do not know The village has an evil 
sanitary reputation so perhaps the SurgeonGeneral will 
hesitate 
MEDICAL ATTENDANCE ON THE JOHANNESBBURG RFUGIEES 
The problem of medical attendance on the Johannesburg 
refugees has had the attention of the local relief committees 
As we have now about 20000 of these people in our midst 
most of them practically penniless there is naturally a good 
deal of sickness amongst them mostly gastrointestinal 
diseases and bronchopncnmonia amongst the children 
Dr Jane Waterston Miss Edith Pellatt LSA and Drs 
Kitching Fuller Hazell Von Landsberg and DarleyHartley 
have volunteered their services and are dividing the duty of 
gratuitously attending the scattered refugees at the six homes 
and at their lodgings in the city Several chemists have 
kindly undertaken to do the dispensing at half ordinary 
rates 
VACCINATION 
The Relief Committee is very wisely insisting on every 
claimant for relief without distinction being vaccinated 
a very necessary measure as Johannesburg has never been 
free from smallpox for years and several cases have already 
been brought down
