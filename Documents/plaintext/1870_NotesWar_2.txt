NOTES OF THE WAR 
ADVENTURES OF AN AMBULANCESURGEON IN THE 
SORTIES FROM PARIS 
WE have been favoured with a perusal of a very interesting private 
letter from Dr Rose Cormack who is in surgical charge of an ambulance 
in Paris and have been permitted to make the following extracts 
Last week was in many respects the most eventful exciting and 
laborious week of my whole life This you will be able to understand 
at once when I tell you that I was in two great battleson Wednesday 
30th November and Friday 2nd December On both days unavoid 
able circumstancesnot likely to recurplaced me in great danger as 
I shall now explain to you I may premise that I was not the only 
member of the surgical service subjected to peril Several of the ambu 
lance service were wounded on the two days I have named 
On Tuesday 29th November I was out all day with my ambulance 
and heard the roar of the battle but was not in it On Wednesday 
from six in the morning till next day at ten oclock I was without in 
termission hard at work At the latter hour I returned with my pa 
tients to my own ward at Les Ternes I slept some hours after this 
and again joined the army I returned to Paris about midnight of 
Friday and have since been occupied with my patients Probably I go 
out to another battle expected in two or three days 
On Wednesday I was with the right wing of Ducrots army at Cre 
teil For some hours I was stationed very favourably for seeing a great 
part of the battle The day was clear I was for some time on the 
roof of a house in the midst of reserves of infantry and artillery and 
quite out of danger I had a good fieldglass Colonel Hicks acting 
as infirmier was with me About eleveni oclock we were ordered to 
the frontabout a mile from where we lhad been mere spectators 
leaving our wagons and advancing with our stretchers and  croix 
rouge flags to a place where there were heaps of dead and wounded 
I was one of a party of four doctors and about forty carriers and other 
subordinates I worked diligently staunching blood and placing those 
with broken bones so that they could be carried to the rear to our car 
riages This was going on when Hicks with glass in hand said 
Doctor you afst look at this pretty skirmishing of the Prussians 
and then we must retirethe French are giving way in front of us 
I rose from the ground to take a peep when a regiment began to pass 
our post into action They had not been ten minutes clear off and had 
only fired one or two rounds when they were driven back at first they 
retired in some order but in a few minutes they were on us in a crush 
ing crowd and the Prussian fire was getting nearer and nearer We 
had to leave our wounded Iiicks and I tried to carry one poor fellow 
who was on a brancard but after a few yards there was nothing for it 
but to leave him A ball struck the ground with a thud within a few 
inches of Hickss foot another struck a stone near me and after 
dancing hither and thither for an instant lay quietly before me I put 
it in my pocket All this happened within a briefer space of time 
than it has taken me to write it We retreated as fast as we could 
with the receding infantry Soon however the retreat moderated 
Up came three fieldguns and a mitrailleuse The i17th Regiment 
began to reform still the Prussians were getting nearer and nearer 
when the mitrailleuse taking up a position exactly in frent of that 
where we had abandoned the wounded and within a very short distance 
of the enemy sent three showers of bullets at them The fieldguns 
did not fire though ready to do so  at once the Prussians ceased their 
musketry the I 17th French renewed their attack and within an hour of 
the time when we left the wounded we were back to them and with 
the assistance of other doctors etc sent to us we completed our work 
My staffI had charge of two wagonswere however dispersed and 
it was not till next day that they all turned up The night of Wednes 
day I passed partly in a church and partly in a chateau ministering to 
the wounded I had also some hours of sound sleep in a deserted house 
of which we took possession 
On Friday evening I was waiting orders to advance when a priest 
came to our carriages He said that he had been confessing dying 
French soldiers on the brow of a hill to which he pointed where he 
said there were at least fifty lying wounded and dying from cold The 
sun had now set the moon was rising  a keen cutting wind was blow 
ing from the north For me and halfadozen brantcardiers to go alone 
so far when we had work nearer seemed absurd  but the priest was 
urgent Our wagons were a mile and a half nearer he said than any 
others I agreed to go on but told the priest to go back to a certain 
point where I knew that more than a hundred wagons were waiting 
orders to advance This he agreed to do and we set off to climb the 
hill On reaching a shattered house in the lane we heard moans and 
entered The house was full of dead and dying An army surgeon 
was in charge he said that he had got cut off from his carriages and 
assistants At his request I sent back one of my stretchers with a very 
badly wounded man I was told by a captain commanding a guard 
that it would be dangerous to advance to the spot indicated by the 
priest that it was close to the Prussian lines and that the battle was 
not quite over We might he said go to a certain point which he in 
dicated but we had on the whole better wait till general orders were 
given to the ambulances    At this time we heard plaintive cries  
the words  Franqais  blesse and  froid being distinctly recog 
nised I said to the captain that if he would allow me two or three 
men as porters I would seek out the poor fellow and do what his case 
required The captain agreed stating however that we must screen 
our lantern and go silently otherwise we would be shot at by the Prus 
sian outposts within whom we would be not more than fifty yards He 
said to his men Any three of you may accompany the doctor to 
bring in a comrade who has been moaning and crying for the last two 
hours over there After some hesitation three came forward laid 
down their arms and joined us in the search Silently we advanced 
stumbling on stones in the uncertain light of a goodfornothing moon 
aided by a lantern  the latter was screened in front but the screening 
cloak was blown aside by the wind and in a minute afterwards we 
heard three Prussian bullets whizzing about our heads We lay down 
and after ten minutes got into a quarry where we found our plaintive 
blessd cold as death and his clothes which had been soaked in Ilis warm 
blood were frozen stiff We gave him a drink of gravy and brandy 
bound his wound placed him on the stretcher and after various ad 
ventures started for Paris The poor fellow whom we took out of the 
quarry seemed as if he would die on the road I therefore resolved 
that if we got him alive to Paris he should occupy one of two beds 
which I had ordered to be ready in my diningroom Before midnight 
he and another of our cargo a man shot through the thigh were de 
posited in the room and left there for two hours whilst I took the 
rest to Les Ternes and did the needful On coming back I found the 
two poor fellows even the quarry fellowsomewhat rallied by heat 
externally and internally applied in accordance with my orders Their 
clothes were cut off them they were washed and dressed and bedded 
and are nowat the end of a weekdoing well They are as soon as 
they can be removed to occupy two of six beds which I have had in 
stalled as an auxiliary military ambulance in the flat now unlet above 
ours When I lay down on Saturday morning in my own bed after 
placing my quarry friend and his shattered thigh as well as the case 
allowed his moans rather soothed me for I felt that had I not taken 
him when I did he must have died The ambulances did not till after 
midnight go on the field an armistice of an hour then took place 
when Prussians and French gathered respectively their dead and 
wounded The carriages which we left near the heights of Champigny 
did not reach Paris till seven next morning 
In coming into Paris on that night I had an adventure which seems 
nothing to tell but which frightened me more than any incident of 
either battle When crossing the Marne on the pontoons by the moon 
light our waggon jolted and tottered as if about to fall into the water 
which was a swollen heavy stream This happened though men at 
each side steadied the carriage Though frightened at the time I had 
forgotten my fright till I read in a newspaper that some six hours after 
I passed an ambulance with six wounded soldiers had toppled into the 
stream The horse was drowned  the men were saved On Friday 
the wounded horses were killed skinned and cut up for Paris food 
The Americans brought back a whole horse for their patients For 
food we have a meat ticket which we are entitled to use every third 
day one day we get fresh beef or mutton the next time fresh horse  
the third time salt beef salt mutton or salt fish The daily allowance 
for each person is now fifty grammesthat is half a pound a day in all 
for the five persons constituting our present family in other words all 
that we get each time for three days use is a pound and a half All the 
animals in the Zoological Gardens have been eaten cats and dogs have 
also been devoured to such an extent that they are now rare animals in 
Paris Our conzcierge has killed and eaten his cat a friend called on 
us the other evening after having dined on a rat ragouit Notwithstand 
ing this queer style of living the general health seems as yet good 
Our own family is very well indeed though we long for milk butter 
eggs and other luxuries long untasted by us and not procurable The 
anxieties and privations of the siege are now such as to call for faith 
hope and courage We have them and are quite willing cheer 
fully to suffer longer still if it be thought that prolonged suffering and 
resistance will save France from humiliation My ambulance duties 
have been successful and appreciated

MEDICAL PREPARATIONS FOR SIEGE AT LYONS 
IN the prospect of siege Lyons has been divided into four parts to 
each of which is assigned a section of the ambulance organisation of 
the city Each section comprises a surgeoninchief a surgeon adjoinZ 
and a certain number of medical officers and of assistants taken from 
among the hospital internes and students one or more apothecaries 
and a certain number of squads of infirmary nurses selected from men 
who are not liable to be called on for military duty viz Frenchmen 
from 40 to 6o years of age with a large number of Swiss and Italians 
who have shown much zeal in offering their services The four chief 
surgeons are MM Petrequin Bouchacourt Rollet and Delore There 
is a large supply of necessaries and it is believed that should it be 
required more will be provided 
THE MIEDICAL SERVICE OF THE MOBILES 
THE Lyon M6dicale of the 4th instant contains the text of a circular 
issued by M Gambetta to the generals and intendants of divisions and 
the prefects of departments It is as follows At the commencement 
of the present war measures were taken to legulate as far as possible 
the medical service of the Garde Mobile and to keep in reserve suf 
ficient resources for certain eventualities These measures were de 
scribed in a circular dated September Ist by which the generals of 
division were authorised to appoint one medical officer to each bat 
talion of the Garde Mobile and to keep at their homes all men called 
on to serve who could prove the possession of a degree of doctor in 
medicine or in pharmacy or of at least twelve inscriptions In conse 
quence of the recent decree calling out all the able men aged from 21 
to 40 provision must be made for the medical service of the new forces 
The following measures are therefore decreed i The generals of 
division preserve the right of directly nominating one medical officer 
to each battalion of the National Guard in conformity with the terms 
of the circular of September ISt 2 Every corps mobilised in pursu 
ance of the decree above alluded to must before marching be provided 
with one medical officer to each battalion or force equivalent to a bat 
talion 3 The generals of division in concert with the prefects of de 
partments will issue direct commissions to the medical officers of the 
mobilised corps and will give an account to the minister of war of the 
nominations made by them As far as possible the medical officers 
should be chosen from the arrondissement furnishing the corps Pre 
ference is to be given to doctors in medicine these failing the generals 
of division may nominate ofciers de sante or medical students having 
sixteen inscriptions 4 Applications for medical employment in the 
mobilised corps must be sent to the generals of division those ad 
dressed to the minister of war will not be answered 5 The medical 
officers nominated by the generals will have the rank and grade of aide 
mtzajor of the first class if they possess the diploma of doctor in medi 
cine  and that of aidlemzajor of the second class if they are only officiers 
de sant6 and can only producesixteen inscriptions They will receive 
the pay and allowances corresponding to these ranks 6 The same 
classification will be made in the case of future nominations of medical 
officers to the Garde Mobile but no modification of grade is to have a 
retrospective effect 7 The generals of division and the prefects will 
take the necessary measures for exempting from mobilisation a all 
doctors of medicine and oficiers de sanzh b all students of medicine 
or pharmacy having at least sixteen inscriptions  c all druggists 
established in business 8 Students having less than sixteen inscrip 
tions will not be exempted from service 9 In other respects the direc 
tions given in the circular of September Ist as to the requisition of me 
dical officers for the service of bodies of troops or of military hospitals 
are not interfered with 
ALLEGED INFRACTIONS OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION BY THE 
PRUSSIANS 
THE Lyont Afidical complains bitterly of the manner in which the regu 
lations of the Geneva Convention have been set aside by the Germans 
It is said that to a remonstrance made by the staff of the first Lyons 
ambulance General Werder replied  We know the Geneva Conven 
tion but the war which we are making is a special war General 
von Treskow is also reported to have refused admission to Belfort to 
two medical men alleging that  to succour the sick or wounded in a 
besieged place was equivalent to a revictualling  The Lyon M6dical also 
publishes a letter from a member of the staff of the Vesinet ambulance 
He says that the ambulance came within the Prussian lines on Septem 
ber 2ISt and on October Ist the wounded were removed and the 
staff sent as prisoners to Versailles There they addressed a protest to 
the Crown Prince who caused them to be set at liberty and sent back 
to the ambulance which however had been in the meantime occu 
pied and the provisions seized The officers of the ambulance were 
after their return daily visited by a Prussian medical officer with a 
patrol there were still twelve patients whom it had not been possible 
to remove One morning they were visited by the Crown Prince who 
pointed out that they were very near MontValerien and in a very ex 
posed situation and offered them safe conducts to go whither they 
pleased This they declined stating that they had been appointed by 
the minister of war and could only quit their posts by his order or 
under violence On November 4th they received through a captain 
a message to hold themselves ready for starting They were informed 
that they were to go to Metz In reply to their statement that they were 
without resources they were told that they would receive money at 
Corbeil On arriving at that place however they only got billets for a 
nights lodging without food and they had to give their word of 
honour that they would not quit the road to Metz Through the kind 
ness of the inhabitants of the places through which they passed they 
were supplied with food The journey occupied five days during two 
of which it was made in carts guarded by a dozen Prussians On 
arriving at Metz they were told by the French surgeonmajor that they 
were not required and might go where they would he also gave them 
a letter to the Prussian medical officer who however would not allow 
them to depart They received billets for lodging for two days from 
the mairie and were most hospitably treated by the inhabitants After 
in vain endeavouring to obtain employment or persuade the Germans 
to allow them to depart they escaped in the disguise of townsmen 
The writer of the letter reached Luxembourg where he obtained money 
from the French Consul and was going to join the Army of the North 
THE Municipal Council of Lyons has allotted a credit of 25000 
francs oiooo to the Society for aiding the wounded 
THE order of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour has been conferred 
on account of zeal and devotion in the care of the wounded on M 
Bresson metdecin aidemtajor of the first class and MM Maury 
Robuchon and Heune pupils of the military medical school at Stras 
bourg 
SMALLPOX IN LONDON 
AT a meeting of the Epidemiological Society on Wednesday evening 
the President Dr SEATON Inspector of Vaccination to the Privy Coun 
cil called attention to the present rapidly extending epidemic of small 
pox in a highly important statement of which we are enabled to present 
a full report There were various parts of the kingdom especially unions 
in Yorkshire and Lancashire in which smallpox had been epidemic dur 
ing the present year and the inhabitants had again entered on one of those 
epidemic visitations of that disease from which the metropolis was never 
free for more than two years together Tracing the course of smallpox in 
London for the last twenty years he showed that the last epidemic period 
terminated about the middle of i868 and that from that time to the middle 
of the present year the mortality from that disease had been compara 
tively small The minimum was reached in the quarter ending Mid 
summer I869 for which quarter only 55 deaths were recorded or 
fewer than are now occurring in a single week In the Michaelmas 
quarter of I869 the deaths were but 62  in the Christmas quarter they 
were 87 in the first quarter of 1870 they were 99 in the second 
II8 in the third 157 or an average of 12 a week In the first five 
weeks of the present quarter the weekly average was 20  in the next 
three weeks 42 and in the last two weeks 6o There had in fact in 
ten weeks of the quarter been 348 deaths registered Though the epi 
demic was already diffused over a great part of London and daily be 
coming more and more diffused it was in the eastern districts that as 
on former occasions it had chiefly prevailed and the circumstances 
under which it had been so fatal in them were in every respect the same 
as those in which it had on former occasions been fatalgross and un 
lawful neglect of vaccination and in many of the adults who had suf 
fered the imperfect performance of vaccination which had not been 
remedied by a subsequent revaccination 
The President remarked that if atthetimewhen thepresent Vaccination 
Act should according to its requirements have come into full operation 
i e in July i868all had been done which should have been done 
if two precious years of comparative immunity from smallpox had not 
been to a great extent thrown away and if the metropolitan Boards 
generally had only taken from the first the course which a few of them 
really did take to administer properly the provisions of the law Lon 
don would not have been in the state of unpreparedness for the present 
epidemic in which a large proportion of it is now He said that the 
successful working of the Act depended on each local authority having 
a proper inspector to see as his regular and constant duty that the 
children whose births are registered have the certificate of successful 
vaccination in due time recorded and to see instantly on the occur 
rence of any case of smallpox that the children and others in the
