AMBULANCE CHALLENGE SHIELD 
The Council of the Volunteer Medical Association have arranged that 
the final competition for the Ambulance Challenge Shield at present 
held by the 2nd Volunteer Battalion Royal Fusiliers shall take place this 
year on Saturday June ist at Wellington Barracks Regiments intend 
ing to compete should signify the same without delay to the Honorary 
Secretary SurgeonMajor de Zouche Marshall Shortwood Teddington 
from whom all particulars can be obtained Owing to Her late Majestys 
death the volunteer medical officers annual mess will not take place 
this year 
THE DEADLOCK IN THE RAMC 
An Old Medical Officer writes that the present deadlock in the 
RAMC has something to do with the abolition of the old regimental 
system supplemented by a  
medical staff Economy is at the root of 
the present condition of thingsa scrape along on a bare peace 
establishment with no allowance for pestilence and war The break 
down in China in i860 was directly caused by the War Office superseding 
the Indian arrangements with which the war began The same kind of 
thing has happened during the Boer warthe attempt to carry on a 
great campaign with a medical establishment not even sufficient for 
peace duties The soldier should be taught to look upon the medical 
department as something to fall back upon when he is sick or wounded 
not as a starved branch of the army He recommends that competition 
should be abolished the old system of nomination with a qualifying 
examination only maintained 
THE RAMC AND THE PROPOSED COMMISSION 
SurgeonMajor Frederick W Gibbon ist Durham VRE writes  
I notice in the British Medical Journal of April 13th a letter 
from Dr Edward Thompson MP in which he suggests paragraph 8  Six months military training at Netley or Aldershota surgeon 
should know enough battalion and company drill to take charge ot the 
men of his own corps when necessary Yet it distinctly lays down that 
a combatant officer who joins the medical branch loses his previous ser 
vice in counting for promotion I know I had three and ahalf years 
 combatant and seven years rank service lost in promotion yet I have 
found that service of most use to mein connection with my volunteer 
I career I frequently come across volunteer medical officers going up 
for examinations who are at a loss to know how to get a company from 
one side of a square to another or do any simple squad movement I 
would suggest that all medical students take out commissions in the 
I volunteer force for when qualified this training would be of immense  
value to them whether they entered as a volunter or army medical 
officer and it should form part of one of the regulations for entrance 
that is not less than twelve months rank on combatant service in a 
volunteer militia or line regiment previous to joining the medical 
staff 
SUGGESTIONS ON THE REORGANISATION OF THE ARMY 
MEDICAL SERVICE 
RAMC sends us a very lengthy communication on this subject He 
writes  The establishment of a Government medical school or cadet 
school does not seem advisable  the present competition is better  butr as an alternative might not the various universities or schools at a 
fixed percentage have the power to nominate to commissions  Com 
petitors should be at once commissioned and pass to Netley for special instruction in subjects connected with the Army Medical Service This 
instruction should last for twelve months and embrace both theoretical 
and practical study in advanced medicine and surgery hygiene bacteri 
ology administration etc A number of medical officers of each rank 
should be annually sent to study particular subjects and to afterwards 
lecture on them at the stations where they may be quartered so that 
the knowledge thereof may filter through the entire service 
The Militia Medical Corps should be reconstituted and to bear the 
same relation to the militia as the RAMC does to the regulars The Volunteer Medical Corps should be similarly constituted and 
wear one uniform 
Courses for the militia and volunteers to be held at various large con 
venient centres and at Netley as a head school under a senior medical 
officer Rank in the auxiliary forces should correspond with that in 
the regular army 
The RAMC in peace should be organised in field hospitals and 
bearer companies to be allotted to fixed stations  reliefs to be effected 
by interchange of officers and men of companies Officers not required with companies should be allotted to base hospitals 
The companies should be filled up to war strength on hostilities 
In field service all orderlies should be carried in carts or ambulances  
mounted companies should have permanent transports  dismounted to 
be horsed by ASC Light twowheeled carts should be allotted to com 
panies Lighter ambulances should be provided Motor ambulances 
should be provided where the country is suitable 
Reserves should be formed of  
i Officers and men who have served in the RAMC 
2 Trained St John Ambulance men 
3 Others who may volunteer 
An increase of regimental stretcher bearers is not advisable under 
modern conditions of small arms fire 
Young medical officers should be attached to regiments for two years 
Principal medical officers should be on the staff of the general officer 
commanding 
MEDICOLEGAL AND MEDICOETHICAL 
GUYS HOSPITAL MATERNITY CHARITY 
On May gth Mr A Braxton Hicks held an inquest at Lambeth on the 
body of George Ernest Eyre aged five days the son of a printers labourer 
living at 24 Caffin Street Lambeth 
Elizabeth Lloyd 16 Caffin Street said she attended the mother of de 
ceased in her confinement a midwife being also present The baby was 
not a strong child when born 
Marian Langley a midwife attached to Guys Hospital Maternity 
Charity residing at 10 St Thomass Street SE the Institution deposed 
that she attended Mrs Eyre in her confinement The child was expected 
about that time Witness was sent for on Sunday May 5th and went 
back again The baby was born before she got there the second time 
Mrs Lloyd said it was a natural presentation Witness attended to thes 
mother and child The latter was a little discoloured but quite normal 
On the Monday afternoon at about 2 oclock witness again visited and she 
paid a further visit on Tuesday or Wednesday when the child was appar 
ently all right  she saw nothing the matter with it It was not a larges 
child One of her assistants then took over the caseone of her pupils 
She was there first and sent for witness 
The Coroner surprised  You have pupils do you  Where is it going 
to stop  Pupils will be having pupils too I suppose I am not surprised 
what the medical journals say about this midwife business Although 
you are a certificated midwife when a call is made you send a pupil who 
finds something wrong and then you go Do not you think you should 
have called the obstetric physiciana qualified practitioner  
Witness  I often have cases like this 
The Coroner  And I have often to hold inquests because a medical man 
who could give a certificate is not called and midwives take too much 
upon their own shoulders 
Witness went on to say that the nurse told her of the death at 9 oclock 
on Friday morning and she asked Dr Sime the physician to see the 
child 
The Coroner  You did not see it No sir 
The Coroner  You could not tell what was the cause of death  then why 
did you give this certificate  
GUYS HOSPITAL  
Guys Institution  
10 St Thomass Street  This is to certify Mrs Eyre of 24 Caffin Street was delivered of a 
male child April 29th that it died May 2nd from inanition with 
convulsions  Marian Langley  
Midwife 
Witness  I had seen the child 
The Coroner  The doctor could not give a certificate because he only 
saw the child after death First of all this certificate is incorrect as to 
the date of death It is on paper headed  
Guys Hospital which gives 
it an official aspect Why did you put convulsions when you never 
saw the child in one  
Witness  Dr Sime saw the child and was of that opinion 
The Coroner  If Dr Sime could not give a certificate why should you  
Have you ever had a case like this before No 
The Coroner  Then I trust you wont give another certificate I never
