IN CEREBROSPINAL 
FEVERMay

Much has been written of late upon the value of the diazo 
reaction as a test for enteric fever but it still seems that 
opinions are by no means unanimous as to the worth of the 
test in the diagnosis of this disease  and it has certainly been 
proved that the reaction occurs in maladies other than enteric 
fever of which diseases tuberculosis is the most important 
Acting on the above principles I have examined the urine in 
125 cases of all kinds and descriptions for the diazoreaction 
The cases have not been selected in any way but the process 
has been applied in the outpatient room and the result 
noted I 
Of these 125 cases in which the urine was examined 5 only 
gave a positive reaction In 120 instances no result whatever 
was obtained Amongst those patients whose urine gave a 
negative result were instances of diseases of the lung of various 
kindsphthisis heart disease gastric ulcer bronchitis etc 
The 5 cases were classified as follows  One was a case of 
acute tonsillitis another of lobular pneumonia two were 
cases of enteric fever in an early stage and one was suffering  
from acute tuberculosis The last patient was thought at 
first to have enteric fever and this from a general 
consideration of history and symptoms The occur 
rence of a positive reaction with the colour test not unnaturally 
tended to strongly strengthen this view of the nature of the 
case 
Nevertheless the event proved that the diagnosis was I 
incorrect Thus the diazoreaction broke down just at the 
very point when it would be of the greatest possible use 
The extreme difficulty even the impossibility of differenti I 
ating typhoid fever from tuberculosis is generally admitted 
and it is unfortunate that this test so promising in many 
ways should fail us in making a very important and difficult 
diagnosis 
Three other cases of enteric fever were carefully tested but 
they all gave negative results These cases were all in a 
more or less advanced stage of convalescence which does 
not however render the occurrence of the reaction in any 
degree unlikely for many cases are recorded in which the 
result was positive months after the attack of enteric fever 
had been recovered from 
I have also subsequent to the above observations made 
many examinations of the urine of patients suffering from 
typhoid fever for the purpose of finding the diazoreaction 
Speaking generally I have found that at some period of the 
fever the result was nearly always positive and this usually 
at an advanced stage of the maladythat is to say at the end 
of the second or early in the third week Positive results 
were always most freely obtained when the temperature was 
high and the symptoms severe in other words they were 
always most obvious in wellmarked and anxious cases 
The result of my observations so far as regards enteric 
fever is that the diazoreaction is of little or no use in a 
practical sense And this because it does not occur at a stage I 
of the malady at which alone difficulties can really arise 
the early stage Further the liability of a positive reaction 
to recur in cases of tuberculosis is a most serious drawback 
and one which alone would tend to render the test valueless 
As regards the 125 cases there was not once a positive 
reaction in the very numerous instances of gout and anaemia 
and the same applies to diabetes 
It has been stated that in phthisis the reaction only shows 
itself in those patients in whom the malady is far advanced 
and that therefore the fact of its occurrence should be 
regarded as a danger signal 
My experience of the diazoreaction in phthisis is not large 
but I have had the opportunity of applying the test in very 
advanced cases of the disease My results do not in any 
way agree with those which would mark the diazoreaction 
cither as of usual occurrence in the later phases of the malady 
or when it does occur as being of any special significance 
In ordinary cases of this description theresult was negative and 
when the reaction was positive there was no reason whatever 
to suppose that the case offered any special feature of gravity 
beyond that which is usual at the stage at which the affection 
had arrived 
It is worthy of note too in this connexion that the case 
referred to above of acute tuberculosis which was at first 
thought to be one of enteric fever although showing a 
wellmarked positive reaction yet some months later was 
in no worse condition the disease not having made rapid 
progress 
My experience then of the diazoreaction is that from a 
strictly practical point of view it is of very little value When 
the result is positive in enteric fever the malady is so far 
advanced that there can be no possibility of error as regards 
the diagnosis In the very early stage when alone there may 
be some little difficulty in determining the nature of the 
malady the test usually gives negative results and even if 
this is not the case the positive reaction by no means excludes 
the possibility of the case being one of tuberculosis 
In my judgement far too much importance is at the present 
time attached to laboratory tests in clinical medicine A 
reversion to the oldfashioned but sound though laborious 
manner of acquiring a knowledge of the symptoms and 
physical signs of disease is greatly to be wished for it is by 
the cultivation of the senses at the bedside and in the dead 
house and in this way only that a real and satisfactory 
knowledge of medicine can be obtained 
THREE CASES OF CEREBROSPINAL FEVER 
TREATED WITH ANTIPYRIN 
By Major E CARRICK FREEMAN RAMC 
Hospital for Prisoners of War Ports Island Bermuda 
By the kind permission of the Senior Medical Officer of Ber 
muda I am enabled to publish the following cases of infective 
meningitis in the hope that further trial may be given to the 
treatment of this very fatal disease by antipyrin 
The disease broke out under the following circumstances  
The transport Montrose left Durban for Bermuda on August 
nth 1901 having on board a detachment of 2nd Royal 
Warwickshire Regiment and Boer prisoners of war of whom 
including some embarked at Capetown there were nearly 
1000 The Mont rose is a large roomy ship with particularly 
airy troop decks the height between decks being greater 
than usual and she is furnished with large portways for cattle 
opening outward on each deck which were kept open the 
greater part of the voyage The prisoners of war embarked 
at Durban were recently captured many of them emaciated 
and debilitated from the hardships of the field  their clothes 
were dirty and scabies and pediculosis very prevalent Old 
men and young boys were included and all were suffering 
from mental depression natural under the circumstances 
The Capetown contingent having been some time at Green 
Point were in much better condition 
Measles broke out at the commencement of the voyage as 
well as pneumonia of a particularly virulent type 39 cases 
with 13 deaths  influenza also ran through the ship None 
of the troops it may be mentioned contracted pneumonia 
and only one measles 
The weather was wet and cold from Durban half way to St 
Vincent afterwards mild and occasionally hot The prison 
ers were not overcrowded having more space than would be 
assigned to troops on a transport but they stayed below as 
much as possible and being accustomed to the veld felt the 
confinement of the ship a good deal They were well fed and 
suffered little from seasickness 
The first case of infective meningitis occurred on August 
19th and was rapidly fatal the patient being brought into 
hospital in a comatose condition The next casethat of 
J de C described belowwas on August 23d The third and 
fourth cases were among the patients isolated for measles and 
both died on September ist after two and three days illness 
The fifth and sixth cases H J C and N de B were admitted 
on August 31st and their cases are given in detail No further 
cases occurred and on September ist the Montrose reached 
St Vincent between which port and Bermuda there was but 
little sickness of any kind 
The first third and fourth cases were treated on ordinary 
lines and proved rapidly fatal  the remaining three cases 
were treated from the outset with antipyrin and of these 
two as will be seen from the following notes recovered 
Case 1J de C Transvaaler aged iq was admitted to hospital on the 
ss Montrose August 23rd in a semicomatose condition continually cry 
ing out and complaining of intense pain about the nape of the neck 
Temperature 103 Antipyrin gr x was ordered at once and to be con 
tinued thrice daily By the 26th the temperature had fallen almost to

normal pain disappeared and the patient apparently convalescent Anti 
pyrin was stopped on 28th but recommenced on September 3rd the 
patient having relapsed with a temperature of 1028 and intense 
cervical pain The pain rapidly diminished under this treatment and 
the temperature pursued an irregular course with a maximum of 10440 
on September 6th and 9th On September 14th on the arrival of the 
Montrose at Bermuda the patient was transferred to the hospital for 
prisoners of war Ports Island Although every care was taken he re 
lapsed after transfer complaining of cervical pain  vomiting also super 
vened and was very troublesome The temperature becoming normal on 
September 21st antipyrin was discontinued and champagne given He 
now improved steadily vomiting ceased and appetite returned and he 
was able to sit up The bowels acted on alternate days with an occasional 
purgative On October 3rd he complained of inability to pass his urine 
and a catheter was used until the nth when the power of micturition

suddenly returned On the 12th he again complained f intense pain in 
the neck and consequent insomnia lying with his head depressed and 
turned to the left and groaning constantly  these symptoms were at once 
relieved by antipyrin and an icebag On the 16th some constipation set 
in which was with difficulty relieved by purgatives and enemata On 
September 30th he complained for the first time of general headache and 
he again had an attack of  cerebral 
 
vomiting Symptoms were not 
improved by sodium bromide but relieved by antipyrin His tempera 
ture now continued normal his appetite good he slept fairly well and 
had occasional attacks of vomiting occasional cephalalgia occasional 
exacerbations of cervical pain until his death which occurred suddenly 
without rigor or convulsion on November 21st the ninetyfirst day of his 
illness No necropsy was permitted Throughout the case there was no 
inequality of pupils Rigidity and stiffness of the cervical muscles was 
very marked also photophobia and partial ptosis of the right eyelid 
Case iiH J C Transvaaler aged 13 was admitted to hospital on 
the ss Montrose on August 31st in a semicomatose condition constantly 
crying out forwater and complaining of pain in the back of the head and 
neck The temperature was ioo reaching 1026o next day Antipyrin 
gr v ter die was ordered and continued steadily throughout the case 
The temperature pursued an irregular course ultimately falling by lysis  
the  
hydrocphalie cry was most marked  restlessness and photophobia 
in a less degree  the neck was stiff and tender He remained in a condi

tion of semistupor until after transfer to Ports Island Hospital on Sep 
tember 14th All cervical pain having disappeared antipyrin was discon 
tinued on September 21st The patient was thin weak and anaemic but 
made an uninterrupted recovery rapidly putting on flesh He was dis 
charged from the hospital on October 19th his mental faculties appearing 
in no ways impaired He liad however wellmarked strabismus The 
bowels acted regularly throughout there was no inequality of the 
pupils 
Case hiN de B Transvaaler aged 15 was also admitted on August 
31st in a semicomatose state complaining of pain in the head and neck 
His temperature was 102o reaching 105o in the evening Calomel was 
given and antipyrin gr v ter die ordered and continued throughout the 
case Patient was very restless complaining of the light and when not 
asleep constantly crying out Doctor doctor or Water water 
Cervical rigidity was well marked On September 6th the left parotid was 
swollen and tender and two days later the right was in the same condi 
tion The patient became extremely weak and from September 10th to 
13th all evacuations were involuntary On the 14th he was transferred 
to Ports Island being very restless constantly crving out Tem 
perature 1046 On September 18th two large boils on the back 
were incised On September 20th fluctuation being distinct both 
parotids were opened and a large quantity of pus evacuated and the 
abscesses drained The temperature fell to 99o On the 21st there was 
slight rise of temperature and some vomiting On the 24th the patient 
although very deaf seemed for the first time to understand what was 
said to him and from this point onward began to make steady progress 
On October 4th a large gluteal abscess was opened On October 15th he 
had a relapse his temperature rising to 104o to 05 and pain in the neck 
returning Antipyrin which had been discontinued since September 
22nd was ordered and continued until September 20th by which time he 
was again convalescent Recovery was now uninterrupted and the 
patient discharged from hospital on December 13th There was no in 
equality of pupils  there was wellmarked squint during convalescence 
but it disappeared before the patient left hospital

To sum up  Of the 6 cases of infective meningitis on the 
ss Montrose 3 were treated in the ordinary way and died  3 
were treated with antipyrin and of these 2 recovered  and 1 
lived ninety days The outbreak was not confined to one 
part of the ship  2 cases were from the upper and 2 from the 
lower troop deck and 2 from the infectious ward which was 
at near the hospital The causation of infective meningitis 
or cerebrospinal fever is still uncertain but the modern view 
that it may be due to infection of the meninges by different 
pathogenic germs receives support from the outbreak under 
consideration when measles pneumonia and influenza were 
all present and from the occurrence of parotid and other 
abscesses in the case of J de C It is also confirmed by the 
case of an orderly St John Ambulance Brigade who being 
in good health scrubbed out a ward in one of the hospital 
buildings in Bloemfontein which had been long and closely 
occupied with enteric cases and died in three or four day 
with all the symptoms of acute cerebral meningitis 
MEMORANDA 
MEDICAL SURGICAL OBSTETRICAL THERA 
PEUTICAL PATHOLOGICAL Etc 
MALIGNANT SMALLPOX FATAL WITHIN SIX 
HOURS 
On April 8th I was called about 8 am to visit a boy aged ic 
weeks and I saw the child within half an hour The case 
seemed a very peculiar one The whole face was covered 
with a subcutaneous haemorrhagic rash or purpura But 
besides this there was a rash slightly elevated on the surface 
which closely resembled that of an ordinary case of measles 
and though that disease occurred to my mind I could at once 
see from the dusky skin and extreme prostration of the child 
that the disease was not measles but something of a far more 
serious character Beneath the jaw and around the neck 
were some halfdozen wellmarked red patches giving an 
appearance as if produced by touching the surface with the 
top of the finger dipped in blood There were as well some 
six or eight similar spots on the buttocks which were also 
covered with a subcutaneous mottling similar to that on the 
face The rest of the body at that time though of an ashy 
pale colour showed no rash of any kind The temperature 
was ioi The child was partly unconscious and groaned a 
if in pain 
I concluded that the case was one of malignant smallpox 
and I informed the relatives to that effect  but on this my 
first visit I was not without some doubt I asked my partner 
Dr Hine to visit the case and though he suspected smallpox 
he could not pronounce definitely I then sent a note to 
the medical officer of health for this district to inform him of 
the case and asked him to examine the child He went 
directly and after his visit he informed me that he thought 
the case an extraordinary one and that he would not then 
wish to decide whether it was smallpox or not As it was 
the first case of suspected smallpox occurring in the district
