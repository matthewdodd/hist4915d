in surgery he should be prepared and required to answer any 
reasonable question in surgical anatomy  also that examiners 
in anatomy might aid all surgeons somewhat more than they 
did by laying special stress on such a knowledge of anatomy 
as was calculated to prove really valuable to the physician 
or surgeon and less on certain details which though inte 
resting to a professor of anatomy could be of little value in 
practice 
The surgeon could not dispense with an intimate knowledge 
of anatomy and there was as great a difference between the 
person who studied anatomy from models casts and draw 
ings and a real anatomist as there was between the art critic 
who derived his knowledge from walking picture galleries and 
the real artist who had worked with his pencil and brush from 
boyhood Anyone who would undertake to perform an im 
portant surgical operation without an accurate knowledge of 
the structures through which he was about to cut or of the 
parts he was about to expose might be likened to a mariner 
who attempted to navigate a dangerous coast without previous 
knowledge of its risks or who was provided only with a chart 
of which he had good reason to doubt the accuracy It 
was most requisite also that the surgeon should possess a 
knowledge of morbid anatomy in its strict sense Closely 
associated with anatomy was physiology or the science which 
treated of the natural functions of living organisms But 
anatomy and physiology did not occupy the leading position 
chronologically in the curriculum of the medical student 
Certain other sciences were placed in the forefront These 
were biology physics and chemistry all of which were essen 
tial as experience proved to surgery Last but by no means 
least he should refer to the science of pathology or the study 
of diseased conditions and processes which strictly speaking 
bore the same relation to morbid anatomy that physiology 
did to normal anatomy So far as the study of diseased con 
ditions in the living was concerned they were provided with 
ample material in clinical hospitals On the other hand it 
was with deep regret that he felt obliged to admit that the 
opportunities for the study of morbid anatomy and pathology 
were not all that was desirable This was in part due to the 
natural prejudice amounting almost to asuperstition that 
existed in Ireland against the performance of postmortem ex 
aminations 
In his opinion it would be much better for the whole 
community at large if that state of things were altered 
In many cases of death where the obedient coroners jury 
brought in a verdict of 
 
Death from heart disease often 
without the slightest medical evidence would a carefully 
conducted postmortem examination reveal a totally different 
cause of death He had long been fully persuaded that 
the extremely careless way in which burials were per 
mitted in Ireland previous to registration and often without 
proper certification was a practice strongly to be deprecated 
and calculated to be a direct incitement to crime and it 
was certainly time that the authorities awoke to a proper 
sense of duty in this respect There was however another 
aspect in which he wished to review this question and 
that was the condition in which that and the sister colleges had been obliged to remain with regard to the teaching of 
pathology It certainly would be an unpardonable evasion 
of duty on his part if he did not protest in the strongest 
manner at the neglect to which they had been subjected in 
that respect and it certainly did not redound to the credit of 
successive Governments that at a time when the importance 
of pathology in relation to the prevention and treatment of 
diseases had been recognised in all the civilised countries 
throughout the globe it should be left to the respective 
governing bodies of the Queens Colleges in Ireland to pro 
vide a teacher in pathology for their medical schools in order 
that they might not be behindhand The manner in which 
the subject of pathology had been permitted to remain un 
endowed in the Cork Medical School at the end of the nine 
teenth century was nothing less than a national disgrace 
Apart from its importance in relation to medical and surgical 
teaching there was the advantage to the public of having a 
skilled pathologist in a fullyequipped laboratory to whom to 
refer such questions as doubtful cases of rabies the bacterio 
logical examination of milk and water and at the present 
moment doubtful cases of the muchdreaded plague Refer 
ence was then made to surgery as an ait tne importance 
of training in the manipulative part of surgery was empha 
sised and in conclusion the means by which a knowledge of 
the science and art of surgery might best be acquired were 
described 
THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL 
We have received the following letter from Mr 0 Stonham 
Chief Surgeon and Officer Commanding Imperial Yeomanry 
Field Hospital  Senior Surgeon Westminster Hospital etc  
Barberton September 20th 
I feel sure that you and our friends and colleagues at home 
will be interested to hear something of the doings of the 
Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer Company oc 
cupying as they do a unique position as the only field hospital 
and bearer company which has ever left the country under 
civil auspices Let us hope we shall but prove to be the 
pioneers of many such should the needs of the Empire un 
fortunately require their services 
Before leaving England I heard it asserted more than once 
that although civilians would prove of inestimable benefit in 
supplying the needs of stationary and base hospitals they 
could not succeed in the more arduous and hazardous duties 
of caring for the wounded on the field nor would they them 
selves be fitted to withstand the fatigues and hardships neces 
sarily entailed by marching with an army at the front 
The career of our Field Hospital and Bearer Company has 
abundantly proved that doubts such as these are unfounded 
and I venture to express the opinion that when the final 
verdict is passed upon our work even the most captious must 
fain admit that the Field Hospital and Bearer Company have 
fully justified the most sanguine hopes of those who so patri 
otically equipped and sent them out 
The Staff 
I have the good luck to have associated with me Major G E 
Hale DSO  RAMC who is in command of the Bearer 
Company No man could be more agreeable as a companion 
and fellowworker and his expert knowledge of transport and 
camp life has been of the utmost service 
Our noncommissioned officers and men have as a whole 
worked hard and well comparing most favourably with the 
men of the regular army and as the majority of them are but 
prentice hands they are much to be commended 
In this and my succeeding letters I propose to give you a 
brief outline of the work we have done 
The Difficulties of the War 
On leaving England our great anxiety was that the war 
would be over before we could reach Capetown now our 
aspirations are in an opposite channel and our thoughts are 
turned homewards Our mental condition has undergone 
much the same change as did the ladys on her first voyage 
for the first twentyfour hours she expressed fears that the 
ship would go down during the next few days she was afraid 
it would not By the way our voyage was not propitious for 
as is well known our transport the Winkfield collided with 
and sank the Union liner Mexican seventy miles from Table 
Bay 
Had we known the country to which we were going we 
should not have had any anxiety as to the speedy termination 
of the war The British are fighting physical geography rather 
than a people and those who have been out here and have seen 
what we have seen will be the most lenient in their judgment 
of reverses and checks which are so easily condemned by some 
who have only the morning paper as a source of information 
and know only the physical characters of their own country 
The Work of the Hospital 
Since we left England we have marched from Bloemfontein 
on May 28th up to the present date 1150 miles have been 
present at eleven engagements and have afforded relief to 
1850 patients We have admitted 650 men into hospital who 
have been carried by the Bearer Companys ambulances some 
times for days and for long distances until they could be sent

by sick convoy to the nearest stationary or base hospital We 
arrived in Table Bay on April 6th and as our ship was con I 
siderably damaged in collision we were at once sent into the 
dock instead of waiting our turn to disembark I need not 
dwell upon the difficulties we experienced in Capetown in 
being sent on  at last they were overcome and we entrained 
on April 29th to proceed north although our actual destina 
tion was apparently unknown However in due course we 
arrived at Bloemfontein on May 2nd having stopped for a few 
hours at Deelfontein to see the Yeomanry Base Hospital and 
have breakfast with our numerous friends there At fever 
stricken Bloemfontein we were allotted camping ground in the 
foulest place which could be found and here we waited till 
May 28th before we could get transport animals We here 
packed our wagons and made all ready for a start as soon as 
we should get orders 
The Action at Rhenoster River 
On May 28th we marched underorders to proceed to Kroon 
stadt We were quite alone and had no escort  indeed we 
marched alone as far as Pretoriaa very different condition of 
things as we were to find later to forming part of an advancing 
army 
We arrived at Kroonstadt on June 4th drew four days 
rations and started the next morning for Johannesburg but 
we were not destined to reach there so quickly as we thought 
It is now well known from my telegrams and letters which 
we have seen in the Daily Telegraph that we were present at 
the action of June 7th when the Boers under General C de 
Wet destroyed the line at Rhenoster River cut up the 4th 
Derby Militia and destroyed our mails stores warm cloth 
ing and ammunition at Roodeval Station which they eventu 
ally blew up It was here that we first came under fire  the 
Boers mistaking us for a convoy and reinforcements firing 
on our waggons but fortunately doing no harm They how 
ever made no prisoners but gave us every facility for carry 
ing on our work and showed us many kindnesses until 
they were driven back by Lord Methuen on June nth 
after which action we admitted to the hospital 12 wounded 
Yeomen 
On June 7th we had 29 killed and 91 wounded the latter 
keeping us hard at work for two days Many of these men 
had been injured by fragments of shell the wounds in some 
cases being exceedingly severe the soft structures being 
lacerated and the bones much comminuted Our arrival on 
the scene was providential Dr Buchanan the regimental 
officer attached to the Derbys was singlehanded and had 
not the necessary equipment with him for dealing with so 
many severe cases even had it been in the power of one man 
to do so 
Our experiences at Rhenoster were most interesting and I 
think I may say unique  but as my letters already referred 
to have given a short account of them I need not dwell on 
them further It was most unfortunate that we had to move 
our camp on June 9th a step rendered imperative by the im 
pending action June 1 ith as De Wet meant to occupy the 
kopje beneath which we were Moving the patients neces 
sarily entailed considerable suffering and I regret to say 
cost some lives which would I think have otherwise been 
saved 
On June nth after the action Lord Methuen came round 
the hospital saw all the wounded men and expressed his 
satisfaction with our arrangements With the advent of such 
a large force we of course became very busy as it soon became 
known that our equipment was all that could be desired 
On June 14th we sent a sick convoy of 106 by road to 
Kroonstadt our ambulances taking them all under Major 
Hales command He returned on June 18th and on the 
following day I took a further convoy of 102 by train returning 
the next day I 
Johannesburg and Pretoria 
On June 22nd we struck camp and proceeded on the way to 
Johannesburg arriving there on the 27th and camped in the 
grounds of the Wanderers Club 
On June 29th we set out for Pretoria and reached there the 
next day when I had an interview with Lord Roberts in refer 
ence to our experiences at Rhenoster River as the result of 
which he wrote to General de Wet thanking him for his kind 
ness to us during the time we were in his hands We 
remained at Pretoria until July 7th camping at Arcadia 
when we received orders to march and join General Mahons 
brigade which was at Rietfontein near Irene Failing tocme 
up with him there we were to continue our march until 
we found him Accordingly we marched to Rietfontein but 
the brigade had left so the next day we determined to push 
on although we had no means of finding out where General 
Mahon was  but an officer commanding a detachment of Irish 
Fusiliers who were holding a position near our camp told us 
he thought Mahon was at Bapsfontein We eventually found 
the brigade whicL had joined General Hutton at Rietfontein 
No 6  but on our way we nearly marched into the Boer lines 
for we had taken a wrong road and only discovered our mis 
take when we saw and questioned our own advanced outposts 
whose line we had passed through 
On July 9th 10th and nth we sent out ambulances as 
fighting was in progress  but we had very few casualties the 
Boers being strictly on the defensive 
On July 12th the camp broke up and the force marched 
back to Pretoria We however went with 50 sick to Springs 
where we arrived late in the afternoon and were lucky enough 
to be able to send the sick to Johannesburg the same evening 
by train The following day we telegraphed to the PMO 
Pretoria for instructions and received orders to return to 
Pretoria at once We marched on July 15th and arrived on 
the 17th 
Up to this time we had been marching by ourselves  but 
we were now to become part of an advancing force particulars 
of which I shall give you in my next letter 
SPECIAL HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA

THE PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS 
Consumption and Tuberculous Milk 
A conference was held at Wakefield on October 24th between 
the Sanitary Committee of the West Riding County Council 
and a deputation representing the Urban and Rural District 
Councils of the Riding to consider the relation of the milk 
supply to public health and the treatment of consumption in 
the human being The want of unanimity amongst the 
various councils on the adoption o the 
 
model milk clauses 
suggested the desirability of an appeal to Parliament for 
general legislation on the lines of the Public Health Scot 
land Act of 1897 The education of Parliament being how 
ever a co3tly undertaking it was decided to invite the repre 
sentatives of the county boroughs to a friendly conference at 
which the whole subject of tuberculosis in milk and in human 
beings will be considered 
Sanatorium for Consumptives for Portsmouth 
The Portsmouth Board of Guardians have recently had be 
fore them the question of the freshair treatment of consump 
tion The medical officers of the infirmary having considered 
 
the matter Dr Gaston reported that with certain alterations 1 
two of the existing wards of the infirmary might be made 
suitable for the purpose Drs Knott and H W Morley 
though agreeing that the two wards selected were the best 
available in the infirmary considered that the treatment  
should be carried out in a specially constructed sanatorium 
and under a specially trained staff of nurses and medical 
officers who could carry out the necessary discipline The 
Board after consideration agreed with this view of the 
matter and unanimously passed a resolution in the following 
terms  
That in the opinion of this Board accommodation for the isolation and 
treatment of persons suffering from consumption should be provided by 
sanitary authorities and that the whole of the Boards of Guardians in the 
county be requested to join this Board in petitioning the  Hants County 
Council to provide a sanatorium to which Boards of Guardians may send 
patients at a fixed rate 
Consumptive Hospital for Perth 
The Committee of Management of the Society for the 
Treatment and Relief of Incurables and Chronic Ailments 
and Care of Convalescents in Perth and Perthshire have 
secured ground on the Barnhill Slope 300 feet above sea 
level for the erection of a sanatorium for consumptives 
The building which will accommodate from 16 to 20 patients 
will have a southern aspect and be well sheltered from the 
north and east Sir Robert and Lady Pullar have provided 
the necessary funds to build the sanatorium A bazaar sup 
ported by many persons of rank and influence is to be held 
in Perth in September 1901 to raise the remainder of the 
sum of ioooo required for endowment nearly half of which 
has already been subscribed 
The Prevention of Tuberculosis in Lancashire 
The Lancashire County Council having decidedas that of 
the West Riding of Yorkshire and other councils have already 
doneto consider the question of a systematic campaign 
against tuberculosis the Public Health Committee of that 
body requested the county medical officer to prepare informa 
tion which would place the Committee and the County 
Council in a proper position for giving this very important 
subject the thoughtful consideration it deserves Dr 
Edward Sergeant has accordingly prepared a report on the 
prevalence and prevention of tuberculous with special refer 
ence to the establishment of sanatoria He points out that 
in the administrative county of Lancashire the deaths from 
phthisis during the year 1899 numbered 2305 representing a 
total of from 6000 to 7oco persons suffering from the disease 
If the phthisis mortality of the county could be reduced by a 
quarterwhich is well within the possibilities of sanatorium 
treatmentthe saving to the county might be represented by 
75000 per annum after allowing a good sum towards the 
cost and maintenance of patients whilst under treatment 
Dr Sergeant gives examples of sanatoria in England and on 
the Continent to show what has already been done He finds 
that the usual cost of treatment in these sanatoria varies from 
jC3 to s a week with extras and is therefore prohibitive to 
the vast majority of sufferers The Grabowsee Sanatorium 
about 20 miles north of Berlin which has been in existence 
four and ahalf years and is intended for the poorer 
class shows that the average daily cost for each patient can 
be brought down to about 3s This institution which was 
described and illustrated in the British Medical Journal of 
July 29th 1899 p 283 consists of a dozen to eighteen Docker 
huts each capable of accommodating eight patients By the 
establishment of a colony of such huts the cost of a sanatorium 
need not exceed 150 to 3C0 per bed This amount will 
however necessarily vary according to the number of patients 
to be provided for and the character of the building 
Although Boards of Guardians appear to have the power to 
provide sanatoria it is a question whether similar power 
belongs to county councils Dr Sergeant however points 
out that under the Isolation Hospitals Act 1893 it is the duty 
of county councils to provide hospitals for those suffering 
from 
 
infectious diseases including certain diseases specific 
ally mentioned in the Notification Act and any other infectious 
disease by order of the Council It seems therefore per 
missible under this Act for county councils to erect sanatoria 
for consumptives 
THE DOSAGE OF DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN 
From a Correspondent 
It appears from inquiries which have recently been ad 
dressed to the British Medical Journal that the question 
of the dosage of diphtheria antitoxin is one whih still pre 
sents difficulties to some practitioners Nor is this surpris 
ing In the first place the dosage of the serum remedies is 
based upon principles very different from those which hold 
I in ordinary pharmacy  we have to deal with units instead of 
I grains or minims In the second place in some parts of the 
I country diphtheria is rare so that a practitioner resident there 
in may have had no occasion to treat a single case since the 
j 
introduction of the remedy into this country in 1894 Con 
sequently the following remarks based upon an experience of 
I a very large number of cases extending over six years may 
be found useful and are offered in the hope that they may 
prove of service to some practitioner whose experience of the 
treatment of the disease since the introduction of antitoxin has 
been limited 
I General Considerations 
In the first place it must be pointed out that it is impossible 
to give a fatal overdose of antitoxin  it is not like opium and 
strychnine and such drugs to the dose of which there is a 
I definite limit Why not therefore it may be asked give a 
I large dose straight away in every case whatever its degree of 
severity  Against this there are three reasons First the 
I volume to be injected is large with very big doses which in 
I creases the discomfort at the seat of injection and is more 
I likely than a small dose to give rise to the rash and febrile 
I disturbance which is often met with a week or so later 
I Secondly the expense of the treatment is increased especi 
I ally if to lessen the volume a concentrated serum be em 
ployed Thirdly it is quite unnecessary to inject a large 
dose in a mild case Even in the severe forms of the disease 
I there is a limit dse to exceed which is merely to waste the 
I material Out of these considerations arise the questions 
I What is a mild case of diphtheria and what are the mini 
I mum and maximum doses  
Mild Cases in Children 
I In answering the former in any given case the age of the 
j patient is of the highest importance Before the introduction 
I of the antitoxin treatment half the patients under 5 years of 
age admitted to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums 
I Board died and many of the remaining half narrowly escaped 
I death Diphtheria in children under 5 is an exceedingly 
I serious disease it is very serious up to 10 28 per cent 
mortality and is still seriou from 10 to 15 10 per cent 
mortality After that age it becomes less serious 4 to 5 per 
I cent mortality up to the age of 40 when it again rises 
I Therefore every child under 15 should certainly be treated 
I with antitoxin If the case is a mild onethat is to say if 
I the exudation or membrane is limited to a part of one or both 
I tonsils and there is no nasal discharge or evidence of laryngeal 
j implication  and further if there is little or no glandular
