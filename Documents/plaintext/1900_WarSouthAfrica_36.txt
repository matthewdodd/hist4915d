THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA 
ANTITYPHOID INOCULATION 
Dr A E Wright Professor of Pathology in the Army 
Medical School Netley sends us the following note on the 
results obtained by the antityphoid inoculations in the 
beleaguered garrison in Lady smith  
By the kind permission of SargponGeneral Jameson CB 
I am enabled to publish the following officially collected 
statistics with regard to the results obtained by the anti 
typhoid inoculations in the military garrison during the siege 
of Ladysmith

In addition t the above summary of results obtained on 
officers and men combined the figures relating to officers 
separately air also givri in the official statistics With 
regard to these last it may be pointed out that quite apart 
from the faet that these figures relate to a quite small group 
of persons 44 in number the figures considered as statistics 
are probably fallacious owing to the fact that the group of 
inoculated officers consisting as it must have done almost if 
not exclusively of young men at the most susceptible age 
is compared with a group of officers which includes all the 
older and less susceptible men and the men who have 
already suffered from typhoid The figures referred to are 
none the less subjoined with a view to conforming to the 
arrangement adopted in the official statistics

In drawing inferences from the figures in this table it is to 
be borne in mind that the erroneous inclusion or exclusion of 
single 
case or a difference in the event in the case of any 
patient included in the category of the inoculated would 
ensibly alter the present aspect of the table 
The same circumstance must be borne in mind in connec 
tion with any attempt to base a comparison of the case mor 
tality in inoculated and uninoculated upon the figures in 
Table I For it will be manifest that in no circnmstances 
oould a trustworthy estimate of casemortality be based 
on a series of only 35 cases Least of all would it be 
permissible to do this under conditions such as those of 
Ladysmith during the siege where many other factors in 
addition ttf th Severity Of the attack must have determined 
the favourable or unfavourable event of the cases It would 
however appear probable in view of the figures given in 
the table that the casemortality was not influenced by the 
inoculation On this subject further light must be awaited 
especially as it would appear from certain statements which 
have emanated from the seat of war that the disease gener 
ally runs a milder course in the inoculated 
The question of casemortality is however quite subordinate 
in interest to the question as to how far the figures presented 
in Table I enable us to estimate in quantitative terms the 
reduction in incidence and mortality which can be achieved 
by the process of antityphoid inoculation 
To answer this question it will be necessary to inquire on 
the one hand whether there were any circumstances other 
than inoculation which may have tended either to diminish 
the incidence of typhoid among the inoculated in Ladysmith 
or unduly to swell the roll of typhoid among the inoculated 
In connection with the former question the only point 
which comes up for consideration is the question as to 
whether the inoculated were more favourably circumstanced 
in the matter of the sanitation of their camps than the un 
inoculated No detailed data for the determination of this are 
at present at hand But this will be seen to be unimportant in 
view first of the fact that there was in each regiment and 
corps an uninoculated majority who must equally with the 
inoculated have benefited or suffered from the sanitary or 
insanitary condition of the various campe  and secondly of 
the fact that the inoculated who were attacked were drawn 
from twelve different corps and regiments It may therefore 
be assumed that the inoculated ana uninoculated were equally 
exposed to the risk of infection 
The question as to whether there were any circumstances 
which tended unduly to swell the roll of typhoid among the 
inoculated is one which requires to be treated at somewhat 
greater length The following points must be kept in view  
i So far as is known with hardly an exception the men 
who are set down as inotilatd were only once inoculated 
It seems probable from the fact that only two cases among 
twiceinoculated persons have as yet come to my knowledge 
that second inoculation confers a considerable additional pro 
tection 
2 It is possible that certain of the officers who are set down 
as inoculated may have been inoculated with an antityphoid 
serum and not with a vaccine consisting of a sterilised 
typhoid culture Two or three instances have been reported 
to me where this error was committed in the case of officers 
proceeding to South Africa In the case of the statistics now 
in question the date and place of inoculation are in the case 
of 5 out of the 9 officers attacked set down as unknown 
3 It is possible in the case of the men as distinguished 
from the officers that revaccination against smallpox which 
like antienteric inoculation was in many cases carried out on 
board the transports may in certain instances have been 
confused with the latter inoculation Instances of this con 
fusion have already several times come to my knowledge 
4 Lastly it is possible that owing to the exigencies of 
military service or owing to other reasons the full prescribed 
dose of typhoid vaccine may not in all cases have been in 
jected Instances of the employment of the vaccine in fourfold 
reduced doses have come to my knowledge It is conceivable 
but there is nothing either to support or rebut the suggestion 
that some reduction of the dose may have been found neces 
sary in the case of the Liverpool Regiment which was inocu 
lated presumably as in the case of other regiments only 
very partially inoculated at Ladysmith on the eve of the out 
break of hostilities At any rate it is noticeable that this 
regiment furnished 13 cases of enteric among the inoculated 
men whereas the whole rest of the garrison of Ladysmith 
furnished only an equal number of such cases 
In view of the above points regarding which there is not at 
present any information available it is at this stage impossi 
ble to determine precisely to what extent the inoculated 
were protected by inoculation But the results set forth in 
Table I would appear to be distinctly encouraging inasmuch 
 as they show that the proportion on the one hand of attacks 
and on the other hand of deaths from typhoid was seven 
times smaller in the inoculated than in the uninoculated 
and it may be borne in mind that if the number no doubt a 
I considerable one of men who had previously suffered from 
typhoid had been subtracted from the number of the unin 
I oculated as might quite legitimately have been done the 
statistics would have borne an even more favourable aspect

THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY OP TYPHOID 
FEVER 
This subject is at present attracting the anxious attention of 
the public owing to the severe epidemic which has affected the 
troops in South Africa but which is now there is reason to 
hope beginning to decline 
Incidence 
While it is a truism that prevention is better than cure 
this aspect of the subject seems to have been almost entirely 
overlooked except by Sir Walter Foster in the discussion 
which took place in the House of Commons From this point 
of view the statement of percentage mortality is of very little 
value because if there had only been a small incidence of the 
disease a heavy mortality would not have been a very serious 
matter but when we are informed that about 10 
per cent of 
the whole army of 220000 men have been affected with typhoid 
fever a deathrate of 21 per cent gives a total mortality of 
four or five regiments or over 4000 men It would seem 
therefore that the primary defect must have been in the 
sanitary administration of this large body of men While 
the difficulty of preventing soldiers in a hot climate after an 
exhausting march from drinking the polluted water of the 
Modder River may be admitted it seems clear from Mr 
Watson Cheynes letter published in the British Medical 
Journal of May 5th that the transport was so cut down that 
there were no means for boiling water while the filtering 
appliances failed to supply this deficiency 
Epidemics rarely occur when men are on the march but 
only after they have settled down in camp for a few weeks 
and it is evident that this is what occurred in South Africa 
When men are on the march they leave their dejecta the sick 
and other sources of contagion behind them  but when they 
have halted for a few weeks it has been the invariable experi 
ence of all previous campaigns that typhoid fever has made 
its appearance Our painful experience on this occasion will 
it is to be hoped impress on commanding officers the para 
mount importance of attention to the sanitary administration 
of camps in the future 
The Special Commission for which Lord Roberts has asked 
will doubtless inquire what means were adopted to prevent 
the occurrence and limit the spread of this disease  what 
means to prevent the contamination of the water supply and 
to destroy any pathogenic organisms which it contained  what 
means were taken for the disposal of the excreta  whether Mr 
Trevess plague of flies was allowed to carry typhoid bacilli 
direct from the faeces to the food supply  what means were 
adopted to disinfect the emanations from the sick 
The reply of the UnderSecretary of State for War to Sir 
Walter Foster shows that the means adopted were ineffective

Total 2087 
Of course it must be apparent to everyone that the mortality 
of these 2087 cases is not yet told so that it is impossible to 
return the deathrate Dr Conan Doyle while speaking very 
highly in our last issue of the manner in which all concerned 
met and dealt with this 
 
calamity draws a very gruesome 
picture of the epidemic itself 
It was appalling in its severity both in quantity and quality  I know of 
no instance of such an epidemic in modern warfare I have not had 
access to any official figures but I believe that in one month there were 
from 10000 to 12000 men down with this the most debilitating and 
lingering of continued fevers I know that in one month 600 men were 
laid in the Bloemfontein Cemetery A single day in this one town saw 
40 deaths 
Such an epidemic in any of our large towns would have 
created a panic 
It is practically impossible to get exact data as to the inci 
dence of typhoid fever in civil life notwithstanding the noti 
fication of infectious diseases but we can readily get th 
mortality in every 100000 inhabitants

When an army is in camp the water supply is a matter of 
the first importance but many other preventive measure 
should be adopted the majority of which can be summed up 
in the words absolute cleanliness When the disease 
broke out it would become necessary to take special precau 
tions regarding the disinfection and disposal of the excreta 
and this applies to the urine and other emanations from 
the sick as well as to the faeces The supervision of all 
food supply to the sick and healthy to ensure that it is above 
suspicion is another duty which calls for the exercise of great 
care 
Regarding the mortality all information supports Dr Conan 
Doyles statement that everything possible was done for the 
patients by the medical men nurses and orderlies with the 
means at their disposal and that the deathrate was as low as 
could be expected under the circumstances 
Results op Expectant and Symptomatic Treatment 
Still there may be an advantage even now of comparing 
deathrates under widely different systems of treatment withy 
the view of arresting medical attention and improving on the 
expectant and symptomatic treatment which has hitherto 
prevailed in this country The UnderSecretary of State fop 
War says that uthe percentage mortality in enteric cases 
during the war and more especially at Bloemfontein ha 
been 21 per cent of the admissions to hospital This no 
doubt represents the condition up to date but as there i 
likely to be still further mortality among the recent admis 
sions it is too soon to arrive at any definite conclusion on 
the subject No doubt 21 per cent compares favourably with 
many of our statistics both at home and abroad as will be 
seen from the following table As our soldiers are mostly 
young men between 20 and 30 years of age in comparing army 
with civil statistics we have taken the mortality of males at 
similar ages

30 to 35    2780  
35 to 40   790 
The above statistics are drawn from a large number of cases 
and fairly represent the results which have been attained by 
the expectant and symptomatic system of treatment in male 
at the ages specified For the purpose of comparison with the 
results of hydrotherapeutic measures we must take the 
figures for all ages and both sexes During the years 18719 
the number of cases of enteric fever treated in the hospitals 
of the Metropolitan Asylums Board was 12017 with a Per 
centage mortality of 174 
Results op Hydrotherapeutic Treatment 
No doubt there have been many large epidemics in this 
country where the type of the disease has been comparatively 
mild and the mortality low In the Maidstone epidemia 
there were 1886 cases and 141 deaths giving a 
percentage 
mortality of 76 Perhaps the only favourable statistics in

HOSPITALS mjoSSa 5 
this country over a series of years from the expectant treat 
ment were obtained at the Cork Street Fever Hospital 
Dublin where between 1871 and 1890 inclusive there were 1405 
cases at all ages with a deathrate of 86 per cent 
These exceptional statistics do not detract from the 
value of the uniformly favourable results which have attended 
the use of hydrotherapeutic measures Liebermeister showed 
that at the Basle Hospital the deathrate was reduced under 
the coldbath treatment from 273 to 82 per cent Dr Hare 
has shown that at the Brisbane Hospital during the expectant 
period out of 1828 cases 271 died giving a percentage 
mortality of 148 while during the bath period out of 1902 
cases only 143 died or 75 per cent This is very striking 
evidence in favour of the bath treatment obtained from two 
sets of cases in the same hospital under otherwise precisely 
similar conditions Of 685 cases under the care of Professor 
Osier only 8 per cent died in the Red Cross Hospital at 
Lyons the deathrate was 73 per cent at the German 
Hospital Philadelphia under the care of Dr J C Wilson 
the deathrate was 78 per cent In the Philadelphia Medical 
Journal of March 3rd Dr J C Wilson and Dr J L Salpinger 
give the result of ten years experience in the treatment of 
enteric fever by systematic cold bathing based on 1904 cases 
collected from fever hospitals in Philadelphia with a death 
rate of 75 per cent In the German army where Brands 
system is rigorously carried out the deathrate for many years 
has been less than 8 per cent In the American army from 
1888 to 1897 inclusive out of 1303 cases there were 141 deaths 
or 108 per cent In 1898 there were 1415 cases with a death 
rate slightly under 9 per cent 
It may have been quite impossible to carry out any 
systematic bath treatment in the South African hospitals but 
cold sponging and cold compresses are always available Dr 
Barr of Liverpool has been for soanae time swinging severe 
cases in hammocks in substitution for his continuous bath 
treatment Here the patients can be submitted to a con 
tinuous stream of tepid water or an occasional douche of cold 
water This method is very simple and very effective in con 
trolling the temperature Under no circumstances should 
overcrowding be permitted Personally if suffering from 
typhoid fever we would rather sleep under the canopy of 
heaven than in any close hospital or tent Febrile patients 
do not catch cold 
THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITALS 
The work done by the Committee of the Imperial Yeomanry 
Hospitals is remarkable both by its extent and its excellence 
The original Imperial Yeomanry Hospital of 500 beds which 
was established at Deelfontein was shortly followed by the 
the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer Company 
The hospital at Deelfontein has been increased until Mr 
Fripp the Senior Surgeon was able to report on June 18th 
that he had 600 beds completely equipped A branch hospital 
at Maitland Camp near Capetown has now been taken over 
and will be placed in the charge of Dr Saunders one of the 
medical officers of the Deelfontein Hospital In addition a 
branch hospital for 400 beds will be opened at Pretoria within 
the next few weeks Major Reade RAMC has been ap 
pointed commandant and the members of the medical staff 
sent out from this country are as follows  
Mr W Langdon Brown Physician MA MB and Mr Herbert Wil 
liamson Surgeon MA MB St Bartholomews Hospital Dr Sandwith 
MD FRCP M RCS KasrelAini Hospital Cairo Mr Stanley F 
Crowther 8niith Physician and Surgeon MB MRC8  Mr A R J

MBLond MRCS LRCP  Mr F L Provis Tottenham Hospital 
MRCSEngM LRC PLond  Mr A H Hayes MRCS LRCP  and 
Mr C S Frost MBLond MRCS LRCP 
The nursing staff consists of 40 lady nurses and there are in 
addition 82 ward orderlies and 8 ward maids 
The Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer Company 
have reached Pretoria after having on the way up been of 
great service at the action of Roodeval 
Mr Alfred D Fripp writes that on June 15 th the hospital at 
Deelfontein received two trains full of sick and wounded The 
first train was theearliest out of Mafeking the second train 
brought the sick and wounded from Winberg and Senekal 
and out of its 96 occupants no fewer than 50 were stretcher 
cases that is to say patients so gravely ill that they had to be 
carried from the train to their beds Of the wounded from 
Senekal he writes  
Many of the wounded from the latter neighbourhood presented a 
feature which was entirely novel to our experience in that they were 
burned more or less severely It seems that our troops had had to 
advance through veld fires A few of them were burned in running 
through others only got their burns when they fell to the ground 
wounded  but from the accounts of the survivors I fear that there must 
have been others again still less fortunate who when they fell to the 
ground were unable to move and were burnt to death 
Colonel Sloggett the military medical officer in command 
of the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital left at once with this 
train for Mafeking to bring down the remainder of the sick 
and wounded from that place Fortunately when the railway 
was blown up north of Kroonstadt the hospital trains were 
south of that place There are now three such trains a third 
having recently been improvised out of ordinary saloon 
carriages with a kitchen truck in the middle 
Mr Fripp has to report a considerable amount of sickness 
among the staff at Deelfontein He writes  
We have had to turn one of the smallest huts into a sick room for the 
sisters They are so closely packed in the ordinary sisters sleeping huts 
that it is extremely inconvenient there when one of them is ill I am 
glad to say that there are no serious cases amongst them but their work 
is very heavy now and their sick room is in perpetual request for slight 
cases Greenfield and Parker the other two doctors who I told you had 
enteric are both doing well Three others of our medical staff have had 
to be admitted the officers ward during the past week but we do not 
think that any of them have enteric Exactly a quarter of the orderlies 
we brought with us are now sick in hospital 
THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALESS CONVALESCENT 
HOME 
It is announced that the Prince and Princess of Wales have fitted up a 
very pretty farmhouse close to Sandringham for the use of officers in 
valided from the war who need convalescent help The intention is to 
offer the home in the first place to colonial officers who during their stayy will be the guests of the Prince and Princess 
Hospitals in RomaniaIn the Archives Orientales de 
Mdecine et de Chirurgie Dr Cosma de Ploiesti gives some 
statistics which appear to show that Roumania is more 
liberally supplied with hospitals than most countries of larger 
size For a total population of 5000000 there are 188 hospitals 
with an aggregate number of 7334 beds All patients are 
treated gratuitously without distinction of nationality and 
the foreigners from neighbouring countries admitted every 
year to the hospitals of Roumania are numbered by thousands 
The hospitals are kept up by the State or by the Communes 
or by the private administrative bodies called Ephorias 
which manage special funds bequeathed by charitable 
persons The hospital establishments are subdivided 
as follows   
Fiftythree departmental or district 
hospitals with 1355 beds  26 communal hospitals 
with 756 beds  33 rural hospitals with 1602 beds  10 belong 
ing to the Bucharest Ephoria with 1016 beds 11 under the 
Jassy Ephoria with 638 beds  10 maintained out of private 
funds with 591 beds  11 maintained by Jewish communities 
with 289 beds  5 lunatic asylums with 749 beds  11 homes for 
infirm people with 405 beds  1 hospital for sufferers from 
gellagra 
with 40 beds  16 homes for aged persons with 324 
eds 2 night refuges with 40 beds In addition to these 
there are 6 nursing homes with 137 beds for paying patients 
The Queens NursesThe annual report of the Queen 
Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses states that the demand 
during the past year invariably exceeded the supply although 
more nurses had been placed on the roll than in the previous 
year The expenditure for the year had amounted to  746 
of which 2500 
was paid out of the money of the Queens 
Commemoration Fund Princess Henry of Battenberg pre 
sented the badges and certificates to the nurses on July 5th 
The President of the Institute said that icco nurses had been 
enrolled of whom 533 had been trained in England and at 
least twothirds of the whole number in the United Kingdom 
The Treasurer stated that the financial resources of the insti 
tute were taxed to the utmost and that the original endow 
ment was now found to be insufficient for the work to be done 
After the distribution Sir Dyce Duckworth one of the Council 
of the Institute congratulated the nurses and said that 
though the training already given was of a high character he 
hoped that it would be improved in the future and in par 
ticular that a term of three years training in hospital would 
be required
