THE BATTLE OF MODDER RIVER tremely improbable that we should have any casualties 
ON Tuesday November 28th I899 was fought the battle of thanks to our longrange guns I obtained permission to go 
Modder River It commenced with an interchange of shots further up to the front where I knew there must be plenty of 
between our scouts and the enemys front line at 530 AM work to be done amongst the wounded Our fighting line had

We the Naval Brigade slept in the train the previous were stretehed out and more or less parallel to the river 
night with our guns in the trucks At daybreak we detrained which was lined with Boer trenches all along the south side 
and got our four 12pounder long range guns into action on the the ends of the sides of the A receding slightly from the 
left of the railway facing NE line of advance Twice the Guards on our right attempted 
to cross the river but failed On the left the Northumber 
THE NAVAL BRIGADE land Fusiliers and gth Brigade made a similar attack and

guns but each 
time to our 
great dismay

fire They were 
however event 
ually silenced 
about 4 PM 
On going over 
the enemys po 
sition on the 
other side of the 
river on the fol 
lowing day one 
could see seve 
ral of our shells 
and hundreds of 
shrapnel bullets 
in the midst of 
the enclosure 
that protected 
the Boer guns 
butunfortuately 
for reasons to be 
given later onn 
the enemy got 
away with the 
whole of their 
artillery The gunners also did excellent work shelling 
the town and the other guns so heavy was the fire that not 
a house escaped being struck and the hotel was set on fire 
To give the reader some idea of the heaviness of the fire I 
took the following notes A small stable built of mud walls 
4 inches thick and covered outside with galvanised iron the 
front wallthat is to say the one directly opposed to our fire 
20 feet long and Io feet high contained the following aper 
tures a I0 produced by unexploded shells b 3 irregular 
shaped by burst shells c 571 by bullets7 are the exits of 
Mauser bullets fired by the enemy 31 are entrances of Lee 
Metford bullets fired by our troops the remainder 533 are all 
shrapnel Most of these latter lay embedded in the mud 
wall that is to say they penetrated the iron but failed to 
penetrate the mud for more than half an inch All the Lee 
Metford pierced the wall and entered that on the other side 
but failed to pierce it The Mauser in like manner pierced 
the front wall and failed to pierce the second The reason 
that 7 Mauser bullets pierced the front wall of the house 
that is the wall facing uswas the fact that the rear wall of 
the house contained an open door and the bullets that came 
through it had only one wall to traverse The unburst shells 
passed through both walls entered another house 50 yards 
almost impreg 
nable and it 
seems a marvel 
that we were 
ever able to per 
suade the Boers 
to leave it 
Practical ly 
the whole of our 
attacking force 
was marching 
across an open 
plain in full 
view of the ene 
my while they 
were absolutely 
and completely 
hidden They 
lay behind 
trenches which 
extended along 
the near bank 
of the river for 
a distance of at 
least two miles 
Behind their 
trenches the 
ground sank to 
the level of the 
river so that 
their men 
horses and their 
largest waggons could travel along the whole of their position 
on both sides of the river with almost absolute safety from 
our fire The river was studded with boats used to ferry men 
to and fro and to convey ammunition as required On the 
other side of the river the ground gently inclined upwards 
and here in strong positions were placed their Hotchkiss 
anI other guns The enemys position was as far as I a 
noncombatant could judge an ideal one in every respect 
but not a man of us knew as far as I am aware what a verit 
able hornets nest we had got into 
CASUALTIES 
Taking everything into consideration our 420 dead and 
wounded which was the cost of our days work was miracu 
lously small Everything was against us we had to attack 
an immensely strong and entrenched position held by a vastly 
superior force while advancing ourselves across an open 
plain We had anticipated a brief and easy victory and in 
consequence the men were not rationed and a battle was 
fought and won by stomachs that had not seen food for twenty 
four hours Water was terribly scarce and every water cart 
that came near the front had to beat a hasty retreat The heat 
was terrific and last but by no means least our chief was

put out of action very early in the day by a bullet wound I 
learnt this in a curious manner On the left of our line I saw 
a horse bolting riderless it was evidently an officers charger 
as there was a sword etc attached to the saddle I sent a 
bugler to catch the horse and found it had a Mauser bullet 
wound through the near foreleg and there was blood on the 
bridle stirrup and saddle Drawing the sword one read 
 Methuen from Chapman Fears at once arose that 
the general was wounded and so alas he was though luckily 
the wound was not serious Firing ceased about an hour and 
a half after sunset Next morning at daybreak our guns 
opened fire but a few shots sufficed to prove that the enemy 
had trekked during the night and thousands must have made 
a midnight march We ascertained later from prisoners that 
the enemy greatly feared a night attack with the bayonet 
hence this hurried retreat They left all their artillerybehind 
them but shortly after midnight discovering that we had 
not crossed the river they returned and removed the guns to 
Spytfontein where they are now encamped What a chance 
we lost Why the reader may well ask did we not push home 
our attack at the close of the fight or shortly after Because 
the men were so done up by the heat of the day the fatigue 
of the long and hard days fight scarcity of water and want of 
food that they were barely able to put one leg before the 
other Thus was lost one of the best chances we have had 
this campaign of capturing the enemys guns without loss of 
life Next niorning I went up and down the enemys lines on 
both sides of the river expecting to count the Boer dead by 
hundreds After three hours careful search I was able to 
count i8 dead Boers and 75 horses so that unless they buried 
or carried away their dead their loss would appear to have 
been marvellously small It is impossible at present to form 
even an estimate of the number of their wounded 
THE BOERS AND THE RED CROSS 
There appear to be men whose aim seems to be to under 
estimate our losses and to grossly exaggerate the losses of the 
enemy men who delight to start tales that stretcherbearers 
and ambulance wagons are fired upon by the enemy etc I 
fail to understand their motives Broadminded soldiers 
must see that stretcherbearers cannot help being shot No 
Boers would purposely fire on a Red Cross party is my 
belief The Boer Hospital here was struck by shell more 
than once and all our ambulance waggons were struck by 
their missiles a pure and unavoidable accident on both sides 
I can myself give an instance in which the sickberth steward 
of my ship was dressing a wounded marine whilst the 
dressing was being put on the patient received a second bullet 
in the other leg but with bullets dropping all round one it 
would be unfair to say that the Boers aimed at either the Red 
Cross or the wounded man This particular incident occurred 
during our last battle at Graspan 
THE MAUSER AND TH3E LEEMETFORD 
The next morning we quietly marched into the town and 
occupied it The day was spent in burying the dead The 
field hospital was very crowded this morning over 400 dead 
and wounded The wounds produced by the Mauser bullets 
are all that could be desired the entrance and exit are 
practically of the same size and very minute Most of the 
patients make an uninterrupted recovery It is a more 
humane bullet than our own LeeMetford for two reasons its 
calibre is less and its velocity is considerably higher I must 
have seen some thousand bullet wounds by now including 
those I saw in the FilipinoAmerican campaign My expe 
rience includes also some experiments I made this year at 
Weihaiwei in the course of which I fired over iooo rounds 
of Remington brasscoated bullets and nickelcoated Lee 
Metford at all sorts of animate and inanimate objects includ 
ing their penetrating power upon various metals a series of 
experiments I hope to publish later on My experience has 
led me to the conclusion that those wounds which heal up 
most rapidly and give the least trouble are wounds produced 
by bullets having the same characteristics 
i A very high velocity 
2 A flat trajectory so that they hit apex first and do not keyhole 
3 A hard smooth sheath with a smooth rounded apex 
it A close range for the same reason as 2 a bullet at a long range may 
hif the objei side oni 
If I were to tabulate theLwe missiles in the order in which 
the wounds produced by them were progressively more serious 
from above downwards the table would read something 
as follows

Io Shrapnel bullets 
xI Shell or their fragments 
I have no acquaintance with explosive bullets it is said 
the Boers have used them but I think this to be exceedingly 
doubtful 
Most thoughtful men will agree that the Boers have proved 
themselves to be brave men and instances of a violation of 
the laws of civilised warfare are few and far between 
THE BATTLE OF MAGERSFONTEIN 
December 13th 1899 
YESTERDAY we attempted to oust the enemy from their posi 
tion in the Spytfontein and Magersfontein kopjes but I regret 
to say we signally failed and today we are in the same posi 
tion but with a loss of Iooo men there are about 700 dead 
and wounded and about 300 missing The Black Watch lost 
very severely2I out of 29 officers It seems that they 
advanced in the night in quarter column and at dawn were 
still in this formation and within easy range of the enemys 
rifle fire The Boer losses it is quite impossible to calculate 
as the Kaffirs that came in from their camp after yesterdays 
battle tell the most widely divergent talesfrom 6 dead and 
40 wounded to 2000 dead and wounded Judging from 
past battles I do not think their losses are a tenth part of 
our own 
Our lyddite shell from the 47 naval gun has a magnificent 
effect to the eye sending up a vertical column of earth 
and dcbris to a height of about 50 or 6o yards It is 
claimed by the inventor to kill by concussion within a radius 
of 34 yards from the site of the explosion The shell weighs 
46 lbs and is charged with the high explosive called lyddite 
chemically a picrate I should estimate that quite 20 per 
cent of the Boer shells do not explode The cause of this is 
doubtful whether due to a defect in the shell or its fuse or 
whether to a scanty supply of these projectiles cannot be 
stated In the action at Belmont when our naval guns were 
shelling the Boer artillery at 3500 yards range we watched 
shell after shell pass over our heads and strike earth about 
700 yards in our rear sending up a cloud of dust but not 
bursting gradually these shell fell shorter till one landed 
between our guns That was the last plugged shell the Boers 
fired each subsequent one was a bursting shell and we very 
quickly had several of our bluejackets hit fortunately for us 
however their artillery was soon silenced and they retired 
The second theory therefore is probably the correct one 
having found the range with the comparatively harmless 
plugged shell they then use bursting shell 
I have only witnessed the effect of the shock of the explosion 
once it was in the person of a Highlander A shell exploded 
about ten yards over his head he was untouched by any frag 
ments but the concussion must have produced some curious 
pathological change in his nervous system as he has never 
ceased now ten hours swaying his head to and fro with a 
pendulumlike motion similar to that of the china dolls with 
the nodding head so commonly seen in the London streets 
His intellectual faculties have also been considerably dis 
turbed as he is only half rational 
THEI GLORIES OF WAR 
Last night there were hundreds of our dead and dying left 
in the field in fact it has taken two days to collect them and 
much suffering has been entailed One poor fellow walked 
into our lines with a towel on the end of his rifle he was 
raving mad and had been wandering about for hours with a 
portion of his frontal lobe protruding through a Mauser exit 
wound in the fore part of his skull 
The medical men have had a terrible time of itworking in 
cessantly for thirtysix hours The field hospital presents a 


JAN l3 Io0 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRIOA Til Iat 
ead but impressive sight one mass of wounded inside rows 
and rows of dead outside it is a sight I think would cure 
once and for all those worthy individuals who talk of the 
glories of war 
THE HOSPITAL TRAINs 
The hospital trains are beautifully equipped and reflect the 
greatest credit on the Army Medical Department It is quite 
a treat to see the nursing sisters attending to their arduous 
duties amidst all this blood and thunder with the same zeal 
and care they are so well known to display in our hospitals at 
home 
THE HEALTH OF THE TROOPs 
The health of our troops is excellent beyond a few cases 
of diarrhoea sunstroke and sunburn there is no sickness 
With regard to the latter trouble the Highlanders are chiefly 
afflicted why are men sent out into this fierce sun in petti 
coats P It is all very well to talk about the uniform being the 
essence of esprit de corps but is not this carrying it too far  
Surely they might be allowed to go into action at any rate as 
other men go As it is their legs become covered with crops 
of vesicles few of the men like their dress for this kind of 
work the beauty of the kilt and sporran is masked by a 
khaki flap and when these two part company the aspect is both 
ludicrous and alarming I saw one man returning yesterday 
from his brush with the enemy in a pitiable plight in his 
own words he had had to  take  a barbed wire entanglement 
at the double and emerged a bleeding mass with his 
kilt hard a starboard his khaki flap halfleft turn and his 
sporran dangling on the wire 
WATER SUPPLY AND REFUSE DISPOSAL 
The water supply is bad being derived directly from the 
muddy river B oiling is imperative The air for a radius of 
over 2000 yards from the centre of the camp is tainted with 
the smell of halfburied horses there were about 200 dead 
horses and mules buried after the battle of Modder river 
but thanks to the vultures the ants and the humble 
microbe they are rapidly being reduced to harmless 
skeletons 
DUST SPOUTS AND LOCUST STORMS 
The latrines are of the simplest long troughs are dug in 
the ground and screened off at night they are filled up with 
earth We have had one or two very severe thunderstorms 
but the things we dread most are the dust storms or as I 
would venture to term them dust spouts for they are analo 
gous to waterspouts Vertical columns of dust extending to a 
height of about 150 yards and travelling at a speed of 6 or 7 
miles an hour pass through the camp and play havoc with 
all and everything making life miserable rifles are thrown 
out of gear food and water rendered nauseous and clothes 
spoilt 
We have had one  locust storm up here at Modder River 
for three hours the air was like a snowstorm but black One 
could not walk ten yards without colliding with hundreds of 
them every blade of grass was demolished and every crumb 
of biscuit or bread on the ground was pounced on by countless 
numbers After three hours they had all disappeared as mys 
teriously as they came The locust storm was travelling in a 
NNE direction 
Tonight at midnight we take our guns up to their position 
at the front and open fire upon the Boers at dawn 
December 14th 1899 
TOTAL LOSsES AT MAGERSFONTEIN 
Since writing the above some more dead and wounded have 
been brought in bringing our total losses in the engagement 
at Magersfontein u to iioo dead and wounded I have also 
heard that one of the army medical officers to whom permis 
sion was given by the Boers to go up to their lines anc attend 
to our own wounded has been made a prisoner of war owing 
to the fact that a revolver was found on his person The two 
Generals have communicated with each other concerning him 
but General Cronje remains firm and claims that men and 
officers wearing the Red Cross should be unarmed I know 
the officer personally and regret his capture but at the 
same time all will agree that General Cronje is within his 
right 
From our Speolal Correspondent In Capetown 
December 20th 1899 
THE BAsE HOSPITALS 
THE work at the base is now becoming very heavy indeed 
consignments from Methuens column arriving in rapid sua 
cession It is satisfactory however to report that the service 
is everywhere standing the strain As I mentioned last 
week No i is now full up and No 2 has well over 400 
patients No 3 at Rondebosch is ready for occupation Two 
days ago when I was out at No 2 seven marquees were still in 
course of erection the construction of the floors taking some 
time Probably they are now complete The accommoda 
tion has been supplemented by the kindness of the autho 
rities of the Claremont Sanatorium who have placed that in 
stitution which is the property of the Seventh Day Advent 
ists at the disposal of the authorities as a hospiLal for con 
valescent officers This offer has been accepted and is some 
what timely as there is no accommodation for officers at 
No 2 
MEDICAL CASES 
Medical cases as might be expected are beginning to 
come in somewhat more freely from Methuens column and 
the medical division of No 2 which is under Lieutenant 
Colonel OConnell is still keeping to its proper work Almost 
all the cases are either rhetmatism or dysentery The former 
come down mostly in a subacute condition with joint pains 
and slightly elevated temperature They have of course all 
undergone some treatment above For the most part they 
are doing well and no large proportion develop heart compli 
cations Civil Surgeon Hancock however showed me one 
case under his care with a very loud long systolic basic 
bruit audible most plainly to the left and quite localised 
Nearly all the rheumatic cases give a history of some days 
severe diarrhoea before the onset of the rheumatic symptoms 
Probably the connection between the two depends on the 
depressing effect of the antecedent diarrhoea more than any 
thing else The dysenteric cases are numerous and in this 
connection it may be mentioned that the affection known as 
dysentery has by no means the typical character of the 
endemic dysentery of India and other tropical climates The 
manifestations are not so severe neither is the prognosis 
either as regards death or chronicity so bad One sergeant 
major of the R AMC has however unfortunately succumbed 
to the disease in No 2 General Hospital As to treatment 
one medical officer with whom I conversed is giving pulv 
Doveri and another the magnesium sulphate treatment The 
results seem to be fairly good I saw one case of ordinary 
hemiplegia which is doubtless syphilitic and is steadily re 
covering under potassium iodide Two or three dysenteric 
cases have developed pleurisy probably rather an accidental 
concomitant than a pure complication Following the more 
recent trend of medical opinion I notice that the medical 
officers are not tapping except in the presence of some mani 
fest indication 
SURGICAL CASES 
On the surgical side the cases coming in present much of 
the routine character to which I have before alluded The 
remarkable success obtained with the perforating thoracic 
wounds is still evident The pleuritic effusion developed in 
a few cases generally becoming rapidly absorbed For this 
one has to thank the splendid physique of most of the men a 
factor largely dependent on the reserve element the excel 
lent hygienic conditions and the good and abundant food 
The record of cases of perforating abdominal wound continues 
to improve upon the experience of the speakers at the Ports 
mouth meeting of the British Medical Association Civil 
Surgeon Hanwell pointed out one case which is convalescing 
steadily with merely a symptom six cases of this class have 
so far done well Under the care of the same civil surgeon is 
another case of much interest A bullet had entered the 
buttock and emerged in the left groin perforating the lower 
and posterior aspect of the bladder going through the attach 
ment of the internal oblique ad smashing the left pubic 
ramus Of course there has been external extravasation on 
the left side but the exit for the urine has been and is free 
enough owing to extensive sloughing of the exit wound 
Now there is an aperture large enough to insert three or four 
fingers through which the shattered ramus and the opening 


102 Tim 
RILJOUNL MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR JA 13 1900 
to the bladder can be clearly seen The sloughing appears to 
be ceasing and there is some attempt at granulation but the 
wound is badly septic and the patient in a marked septicemic 
condition At first a drainage tube was inserted but this be 
came so constantly blocked with sloughing fragments that it 
was discontinued and Mr Hanwell is now irrigating through 
the bladder with boracic lotion 
The spinal cases are the mQst disheartening things one sees 
in the hospitals although they bring out the excellent nurs 
ing which is evident everywhere In one which became the 
subject of a necropsy the cord was found literally smashed 
for over an inch CivilSurgeon Hanwell did an exploratory 
laminectomy in one of his cases hit between the second and 
third dorsal but found the laminae intact and no result 
followed 
In another case I saw the tibia was splintered by a bullet 
The wound had been enlarged and a number of fragments 
removed some as large as ones thumb and a drainage tube 
inserted The wound had not remained aseptic and effusion 
into the kneejoint has followed The joint has been punc 
tured and the fluid I saw two days ago was distinctly semi 
purulent 
Major Lougheed RAMC is in charge of the Surgical 
Division of No 2 and has under him Major Macdonald 
RAMC and 8 civil surgeons 
THEE NEW SOUTH WALES MEDICAL CORPS 
I had an opportunity of inspeeting the New South Wales 
Medical Corps the other day It is a most smart and service 
able unit and splendidly trained The men wear of course 
the distinctive Australian smasher hat It is organised as a 
halfbearer company and a field hospital of 5o beds and 
7 officers with 83 noncommissioned officers and men Colonel 
Williams is in command The equipment is singularly com 
plete and what is noticeable the transport is entirely in the 
hands of the corps itself The bearer half company has 5 
waggons for sick a water cart and I waggon and 3 carts for 
equipment The hospital has 6 covered carts I Maltese cart 
and a water cart There are 53 horses in the combined 
transport The hospital tents are 4 of the tortoise pattern 
for 12 patients each There is another tortoise tent for opera 
tions The corps has come equipped with every requirement 
including its own xray apparatus 
THE STATIONARY HOSPITALS 
At present the 4 stationary hospitals are distributedi at 
De Aar another at East London and 2 in Natal I40 invalids 
left for England in the Aurania in charge of Civil Surgeon 
Cochran The Trojan hospital ship is still at East London 
The new company of the Cape Medical Staff Corps which is 
being raised under the Principal Medical Officer of the base 
is being trained as a bearer company The Capetown Station 
Hospital at Woodstock has been raised to 250 beds 
THE RED CROSS 
The combined aid societies under Colonel Youngs direc 
tion are doing excellent work and the hospitals both at 
the base and on the lines are being well supplied with 
comforts of all kinds Colonel Young has appointed 
Major Lovegrove a retired officer to the charge of the 
dep6t at Wynberg and he distributes the gifts in kind 
between Nos I and 2 The Committees on the railway lines 
are helping valiantly in the work of providing for the wounded 
en route The people in Capetowvn continue to bestow gifts 
both in money and kind most liberally and as I said before 
the patriotism of the Malays and Coloured People is most 
praiseworthy There is a little tendency for individual efforts 
in particalar lines For instance one boys school raised over 
6 to provide fans for the patients at De Aar in which dusty 
hot place they are sorely needed Without Colonel Youngs 
suave personality this generosity would have run riot but he 
has don wonders in bringing order out of chaos 
The irregular Colonial Corps are not behindhand in pro 
viding themselves with regimental ambulances Brabants 
Horse is calling for 48 men and the South African Light Horse 
has 4 ambulance men per squadron 
 The local civil surgeons engaged to attend to the posts on 
the lines of communication are receiving 6I per diem

BELEAGUERED GARRISONS 
TIME passes and still we regret to see that it has not yet 
been practicable to relieve any of the garrisons so long 
beleaguered and so gallantly held in South Africa Kuruman 
which has fallen after holding out for many weeks against 
overwhelming numbers is fortunately of no strategic import 
ance and is chiefly of interest as having been the site of one 
of Livingstones first residences and missionary stations in 
Africa For some time past disquieting reports of increasing 
sickness have been sent in from Ladysmith both typhoid 
fever and dysentery are apparently carrying off many victims 
It is difficult from the short telegrams to arrive at the 
exact mortality We are entirely in the dark as to the 
food supplies in Ladysmith and it is quite possible 
that if rations are both low and poor in quantity they 
may be largely responsible for the dysentery and 
would tend to render a man more susceptible to typhoid 
fever In addition to these two serious forms of disease 
there can be no doubt that a considerable amount 
of what is commonly known as  camp fever  one of the 
 unclassified fevers  of the tropics exists Sir George White 
has himself been reported for a short time invalided with 
fever which obviously cannot have been typhoid Fortu 
nately Ladysmith is well provided with medical men in the 
Army Medical Department and also from South African 
sources Both Dr Jameson who for many years was renowned 
in medical practice in Kimberley and Dr Davies of equally 
good repute in Johannesburg are with the garrison These 
two gentlemen have had many years South African experience 
of all forms of fever so common in upcountry South African 
towns during the summer months and whatever medical skill 
can do we are convinced will be done Mafeking from its posi 
tion will be more liable to camp fever even than Ladysmith 
and Lord Edward Cecil and other officers and men reported 
to be suffering from fever are probably for the most part 
affected with camp fever although undoubtedly in both 
towns typhoid fever has occurred 
CAMP FEVER 
Camp fever it has been said is one of those vague terms 
used to cloak the ignorance of physicians and it must be ad 
mitted that it is difficult of scientific definition and some 
times is loosely applied to anything from solar fever to the 
worst form of typhoid It is however usually confined to 
solar fever and cases of simple continued fever It is not in 
any sense of the word a malarious fever nor is it as a rule 
more than highly inconvenient From solar fever which may 
be taken to be a minor form of sunstroke and which is pro 
duced by prolonged intense heat the recovery is usually only 
a matter of a few days Simple continued fever almost in 
variably ends in recovery but is apt to be much more chronic 
in character The distinction between these and typhoid 
fever is often somewhat difficult especially as the tropical 
form of typhoid is frequently characterised by the abeence of 
such diagnostic symptoms as the typhoid spots and diarrhoea 
or haemorrhage 
SCuRVY IN KIMBERLEY 
A Reuters message from Kimberley dated January 3rd 
states that typhoid and scurvy are somewhat on the increase 
as however the same telegram states that Mr Rhodes at 
Christmas provided some fortytwo plum puddings which 
were cooked at the sanatorium for distribution among the 
various camps we sincerely hope we may take it that sup 
plies are still very far from running short in that town The 
population shut up in Kimberley is large probably close 
upon 20000 and the question of supplies is no doubt serious 
At the same time it is probable that the De Beers Company 
which it is reported provided themselves with arms have 
also liberally provided themselves with stores against the 
possibility of that siege which has since been realised Know 
ing Kimberley and its inhabitants well from having resided 
there some years I expect that the scurvy referred to exists 
principally if not entirely among the natives shut up in the 
mining compounds There are 8ooo or Ioooo of these natives

snade to send them away to their distant homes on 
two occasions but on both occasions they have been 
turned back by the besieging Boers who probably 
recognise that their presence in Kimberley will be an ad 
ditional strain on the resources of the town and embarrass 
the defenders Scurvy is by no means in my experience un 
common among the natives who go to work in the mines The 
native at his own kraal or village is a great vegetable feeder and 
is accustomed to young mealies and other forms of fresh green 
vegetables of late years these together with plenty of lime 
juice have teen supplied by the mines in their various com 
pounds so that scurvy had become a comparatively rare 
disease amongst them but I have little doubt that under the 
present arduous conditions both vegetables and lime juice 
are running low hence the scurvy At the same time I do 
not anticipate that the restriction of diet amongst the European 
inhabitants has yet become so great as to produce the disease 
to any extent in them 
RELIEF OF MAFEKING 
The relief of Mafeking is a matter of speculation at least as 
lar as the general public is concerned but there have been 
from time to time indications that a force from the north was 
on its way down the line of railway it has even been stated 
that it was in the neighbourhood of Mochudi and Gaberones 
It is sincerely to be hoped that this is so for should the force 
have to come by Maclutsi which is in the low country on the 
Crocodile still further north at this time of year a good deal 
of malarial fever among the men and horse sickness among 
horses would it is to be feared be encountered The only 
districts in which malaria may be suffered by some of our 
forces during this campaign are those along the valley of the 
Crocodile to the northwest of the Transvaal in which both 
Tuli and Maclutsi are situated 
ARRIVAL OF THE WOUNDED AT SOUTHAMPTON 
A further batch of wounded from the front arrived at 
Southampton on January 5th on the Cunard liner Aurania 
She had on board 2 officers and 141 men most of whom had 
been wounded in action Every preparation was made for 
their reception and a special train conveyed them to Netley 
Hospital The majority of the men improved greatly during 
the voyage and appeared to be quite cheerful Some of the 
cases were of a serious nature The majority of these men had 
served under Lord Methuen others had been attached to the 
Ladysmith relief column The two officers on boardLieu 
tenant Cameron of the Grenadier Guards and Lieutenant 
Carroll of the Munster Fusilierswere not seriously wounded 
LYDDITE 
With regard to the effect of lyddite as an explosive in 
warfare we are still rather in the dark We are told that a 
lyddite shell exploding will destroy life within a considerable 
area by the mere force of concussion on the other hand a 
certain Mr Preller writing to the Volkstem a South African 
Dutch newspaper says 
 
We were standing close to Long Tom which was as always attracting 
the enemys shell fire One of the British guns fired at us and the shell 
fell close to us with a tremendous noise It struck just behind our guns 
and sank 4 feet into the solid ground making a hole big enough to bury 
one horse and one man standing Everyone expected that he would be 
the first victim of this wonderful lyddites terrific power Well the fatal 
smoke cloud arose and fragments of shell snarled around us in all direc 
tions We stood and looked with bated breath The smoke cleared way 
and we found that not a man of us had been hurt So there was another 
bubble burst The lyddite smoke was proved to be nonfatal and 
its general effect altogether less terrifying than we had been led to 
believe 
THEI SIVEWRIGHT AMBULANCE 
In my last letter I referred to Sir James Sivewrights ambu 
lance As this same ambulance has been the subject of a 
good deal of criticism in various papers it is only fair to give 
Sir James Sivewrights own statement to an interviewer who 
called on him on behalf of South Africa with reference to 
this question 
Sir J Sivewright said the party was composed of eight Afrikander stu 
dents all British subjects and members of the South African Students 
Union in Edinburgh of which he is the President with Dr Gray Mrs 
Gray and Mrs Bamford nurses and Mr Alan Johnson The object for 
which they went to South Africa was to nurse and tend to the sick and 
wounded irrespective of creed colour or nationality With this object 
the War Office fully agreed and the party left with their approval On 
arrival in Cape Town after an interview with Sir Alfred Milner the party 
were forwarded by the ObngeUa to Delagoa Bay and according to a tele 
gram he had on Sunday morning received from Pretoria the Afrikanders 
and Mrs Bamford had in the latter part of last week arrived at the 
Transvaal capital There appeared to have been no hitch except in the 
case of Dr Gray who had apparently been refused permission to cross 
the border and Mrs Gray had doubtless stayed with her husband Of 
Mr Alan Johnson there was no mention and he might be among the 
party arrived in Pretoria or he might have cast in his lot with Dr and 
Mrs Gray Dr Gray was known to have carried with him a number of 
letters from friends to British officers in Pretoria and this one of the 
cablegrams suggested to Sir James Sivewright might account for his in 
ability to obtain a permit to proceed 
As to the inference continued Sir James that the male members of the 
party had gone to the Transvaal with any motives save those mentioned 
I may say that a member of a leading West End club told me the other 
day he had heard from a fellow member that not only were the party 
armed but that the names of the manufacturers who had supplied the 
arms and ammunition could be given I immediatel offered to give Srcoo 
to the Lord Mayors Fund if itcould beproved that there was the slightest 
foundation for such a statement I am still waiting to hear from that 
West End club The lads have absolutely no weapons with them except 
such as Mr Montague the wellknown surgical instrument maker of 
Bond Street supplied them with They are pledged to meno matter 
what their private feelings may beto give their services solely to the 
sick and wounded I know the young fellows and believe they will be as 
good as their word 
Such is Sir James Sivewrights explanation and I confess 
that it does not seem to me to very much alter the position 
Dr Gray was the responsible and qualified surgeon in charge 
of this ambulance and to say that there was no hitch in the 
affair except in the case of Dr Gray who had been refused 
permission etc is equivalent to the announcement that the 
play of Hamlet will be proceeded with as usual with the 
omission of the Prince of Denmark However cosmopolitan 
Sir James Sivewrights sentiments may be it is quite obvious 
that Mr Kruger is determined that the ambulance party shall 
be Boers and Boers only the Boer medical student being in 
his opinon better for the nursing and tending of the sick and 
wounded  irrespective of creed colour or nationality than 
the qualified surgeon who was also a Scotchman 
HORSES AND THE CLIMATE OF SOUITH AFRICA 
It has been more and more evident as the campaign pro 
ceeds that mounted men are essential to successful operations 
as mounted infantry scouts and cavalry The somewhat 
tardy realisation of this on the part of the authorities has led 
to the wholesale exportation of horses from England and 
Australia to the Cape 
While I have no hesitation in saying at the outset that for 
South African warfare trained South African horses if obtain 
able in sufficient numbers would undoubtedly be the most 
suitable animals and that I very much question whether the 
military authorities have not shown the same mistaken tardi 
ness in securing them as they have in enlisting the invaluable 
services of British colonists yet I believe that in the case of 
the large numbers of horses exported and still being exported 
from Australia and from England to South Africa all that will 
be necessary in a large proportion of instances will be that 
they shall have a sufficient period of time to get over the 
stiffness and loss of condition entailed by the voyage A few 
weeks should be sufficient for this and the only further risk 
which the horse would run would be the horse sickness It is 
quite probable that the imported horse is more liable to this 
disease than the native but the precautions which are neces 
sary against it I have already discussed Many instances 
have come under my notice in South Africa where imported 
English racehorses have sufficiently recovered their condition 
in the course of a few months in the country to win the best 
races It is notorious that no animal adapts himself so 
readily to a change of climate as man but nevertheless there 
is no question that in many instances English or Australian 
horses soon become thoroughly fit and well in South Africa 
THE LANGMAN HOSPITAL 
We understand that this hospital will probably be ready to 
sail for South Africa about February 3rd Dr Conan 
Doyle will accompany the hospital in the capacity of Secretary
