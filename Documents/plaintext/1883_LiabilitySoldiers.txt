continuous layer In the formation of tho central nervous system both 
Strata of the epiblast have a share though the principal portion is 
derived from the nervous layer After the central tube has become 
separated from the external skin the two layers forming it fuse to 
gether but there is little doubt that at a later period the epidermic 
layer separates itself again as the central epithelium of the nervous 
system Both the nervous and epidermic strata have a share 
in forming the general epiblast and though eventually they par 
tially form together yet the horny layer of the adult epidermis 
where such can be distinguished is probably derived from 
the epidermic layer of the embryo and the mucous layer of 
the epidermis from the embryonic mucous layer In the forma 
tion of the organs of sense the mucous layer is the most active 
the len9 of the eye and the auditory sac being entirely derived 
from it tho latter having no external opening The outer 
layer of epiblast cells becomes ciliated after the close of the seg 
mentation but the cilia gradually disappear on the formation of the 
internal gills The cilia cause a close rotatory movement of the 
embryo within the egg and probably assist in the respiration after 
it is hatched They are especially developed on the external 
gills 
After the disappearance of the segmentationcavity the mesoblast 
forms according to most authorities a continuous sheet round the 
ovum underneath the epiblast The first important differentiation 
in it takes place in the axial dorsal line along which a central end 
of mesoblast becomes separated from the two lateral sheets to form 
the notochord After the formation of the notochord the 
mesoblast may be regarded as consisting of two lateral plates con 
tinuous ventrally but separated in the middle line dorsally By the 
division of the dorsal parts of these plates into segments which 
commences in the region of the neck and then extends back 
wards the mesoblast of the trunk becomes divided into a vertebral 
portion cleft into separate somnites and a lateral unsegmented 
portion 
The hypoblast is continuous with the yolkcells laterally and in 
front The definite closing in of the mesenteron by the true hypo 
blast cells begins in front and behind and takes place last of all in 
the middle In front this change takes place with greatest 
rapidity Hie cells of the yolkfloor become continuously differen 
tiated into hypoblastcells and very soon the whole of the front end 
becomes completely lined by these hypoblastic cells while the yolk 
cells become confined to the floor of the middle part The front 
portion of the mesenteron gives rise to the oesophagus stomach 
and duodenum Close to its posterior boundary there appears a 
ventral outgrowth which is the commencement of the hepatic 
diverticulum The yolk is therefore posthepatic as in vertebrates 
generally The stomodseum is formed comparatively late by 
an epiblastic invagination At first the mesenteron communi 
cates freely with the exterior by the opening of the blasto 
pore The lips of the blastopore gradually approximate and 
form a narrow passage on the dorsal side of which the neural 
tube opens The external opening of this passage finally be 
comes obliterated and the passage itself is left as a narrow 
tract leading from the hinder end of the mesenteron into the 
neural canal It forms the postanal gut and gradually nar 
rows and finally atrophies At its front border on the ventral side 
there may be seen a very slight diverticulum of the alimentary 
tract directed downwards ventrally This becomes longer and 
meets with an invagination of the skin This invagination is the 
proctodaeum and an anal perforation ultimately appears at its upper 
end The differentiation of the hinder end of the praeanal gut 
takes place in the same way as that of the front end though some 
what later It gives rise to the cloacal and intestinal part of the 
alimentary tract From the ventral wall of the cloacal section 
there grows out the bifid allantle bladder which is probably homo 
logous with the allantis of higher vertebrates After the differen 
tiation of the ventral wall of the anterior and posterior ends of the 
alimentary tract has proceeded so far the yolk only forms a floor 
for a restricted median region of the alimentary cavity which cor 
responds to the umbilical canal in the amniota The true hypo 
blastic epithelium then grows over the outer side of the yolk which 
then constitutes a true though small and internal yolksac The 
yolkcells enclosed in this sac become gradually absorbed and the 
walls of the sac form part of the intestine

ON THE LIABILITY OF SOLDIERS TO CONTRACT 
DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 
By Deputy SurgeonGeneral D CULLEN MD 
Continued frm page 999 
The examination of the table of diseases shows two obsolete terms 
carditis and morbus cordiswhich disappeared with the intro 
duction of the new nomenclature in 1869 The former term was 
largely used in the returns from India and embraced cases of pal 
pitation from irritable heart dilatation and hypertrophy Its in 
accurate use led to criticism in the Madras Statistical Report for 
1866 when 127 cases were returned from that command and only 
10 from Bengal and 3 from Bombay The 18th Hussars gave 47 
cases attributed by the surgeon to the inordinate use of tobacco 
the men 
appearin 
 to be regularly saturated with nicotine The 
term morbus cordis had an equally wide interpretationembracing 
both functional and organic ailments thus 10 cases from the Straits 
Settlements in 1868 had 
 
excited action of the heart accompanied 
by severe dyspnoea and pain in the cardiac region sometimes fol 
lowed by syncope 
Under these now happily obsolete terms will 
be found 616 admissions 36 deaths and 97 invalided The organic 
diseases of the heart show 9634 admissions 1230 deaths and 3629 
invalided while functional diseases cause 5648 admissions 12 
deaths and 689 invalided syncope and palpitation being included 
in this section The diseases of the aorta present a total of 959 
admissions 818 deaths and 167 invalided  diseases of arteries 389 
admissions 201 deaths and 137 invalided  diseases of veins 1816 
admissions 11 deathsand 1073 invalided while unspecified dis 
eases of the heart and vessels constitute 1152 admissions 259 
deaths and 68 invalided 
In the first of these fivesections pericarditis shows no very 
marked annual variation  69 admissions 8 deaths and 5 invalided 
are the average annual results India has a predominance of ad 
missions the nome army of deaths and invalids The other diseases 
of the pericardium are unimportant Endocarditis is a term littlo 
employed in the returns 
Disease of the valves has a large significance the greatest for 
the decade in all respects of admissions deaths and invaliding 
although in the second quinquennial period palpitation gives the 
higher admissionrate The annual average admissions by this dis 
ease are 593 in one year reaching 727 the admissionrate for that 
year in the Madras Presidency being 878 or more than double the 
average of all India which is 420 per 1000 of mean strength 
For the decade the troops stationed at home in the Mediterra 
nean and British America have the smallest admissionrates vary 
ing from 268 to 288  the garrisons in China Australia Japan and 
the Straits Settlements give a ratio of 351  the West Indies of 401  
and the group consisting of Mauritius Ceylon the Capo of Good 
Hope and St Helena of 567  this being the highest annual average 
with the exception of Madras which is 5C9 The annual average 
deathrate is highest in the China group being 85  Bengal the 
Cape group and West India garrisons arc 61  Madras 58  British 
America 51 Home 34 and the Mediterranean the lowest 32 
The invaliding rate is highest in the Cape group179 and lowest 
in British America102  in the Mediterranean 161  in India and 
at home 159 but the Presidencies of India vary from 164 in 
Bengal to 138 in Bombay The high invaliding rate at home is 
due to the nnmber of recruits who break down in their first year of 
service 
In 187071 of 41763 recruits joining 442 were invalided in their 
first year of whom 101 were from diseases of the circulation being 
242 per 1000  Dr Balfour then the able head of the statistical 
branch makes the following comment on the occurrence Among 
the recently enlisted soldiers who have broken down tho third 
great cause of invaliding coming after tubercular and nervous 
chiefly epileptic diseases 
 
has been the class uf diseases of the 
circulatory system and especially valvedisease and hypertrophy of 
the heart He names4pack drill severe exercise constriction of 
the chest from tight clothing or accoutrements as tending to 
their development a tendency aggravated by habits of intemper 
ance or debanchcry This liability among recruits to break 
down was greatest in the Foot Guards next in the Artillery and 
lowest in the Cavalry and Infantry Among matured soldiers of the 
different arms of the service the liability appears greatest in the 
Artillery next in the Infantry third in the Cavalry fourth in the 
Foot Guards whilst it is lowest in the Household Cavalry The

deathrate is slightly highest in the Foot Guards  the Invaliding 
rate is highest in the cjepts of the line and Artillery where the 
older soldiers are massed and where it reaches 7 to 8 per 1000 of 
mean strength It has been shown that the highest invaliding rate 
for valvedisease was in that group of stations associated with the 
Cape In 1866 InspectorGeneral Lawson wrote regarding Jthis 
affection  The cause of the valvular disease of the heart seems 
connected with a riieumatic diathesis and in this country generally 
accompanies rheumatic fever with wellmarked affection of the 
joints Suh cases of highly developed rheumatic fever are ex 
tremely rare among the troops in South Africa but muscular rheu 
matism implicating the parietes of the chest is particularly com 
mon during 
 
the warm Weather 
 
H refers to the easily induced 
excitable action of the heartJat that season and the possibility in 
certain diatheses of the rheumatic affection inducing structural 
changes in the valves  while he combats the idea of overexertion 
or excesses in  Boer brandy or tobacco causing this relative fre 
quency of cardiac disease  
  
The effects of the 
campaign 
in Abyssinia in 186768 in inducing 
valvedisease are notable Th1 whole of the men invalided at 
Netley after the operations were 76 of whom 16 were for this affec 
tion being in respect of invaliding the most prominent of all dis 
eases It is in fact equal to the whole Of the invaliding for mias 
matic disease both being 107 per 1000 of the average annual 
strength inspectorGeneral Currie remarks en the intensely cold 
nights and hot daystheone Siberian the other tropical during 
the progress of the expedition  these climatic features being ecom  
panied by a remarkably dry condition of the atmosphere It will 
be remembered that the forces were six months employed and 
marched 800 miles to and from Magdala some of their camping 
grounds being over 10000 feet above the sealevel and the paths 
steep difficult and precipitous The long ascents and descents of 
mountain passes and formidable ravines proved excessively fatigu 
ing and demanded greater physical exertion and powers of endur 
ance than British troops have probably ever undergone Previous 
Indian service rendered the men more liable to dysentery diarrhoea 
and ague which were prevailingdiseases  rheumatism was not un 
common one admission in nineteen being due to this cause No 
native liquors were procurable and there was no intemperance 
The recent operations in the Transvaal and Zulularid afford an 
opportunity for comparing that period rof unrest with one slightly 
preceding it when the troops were settled From 1867 to 1871 the 
annual ratio of admissions for diseases f the circulatory system 
was 954 in South Africa the deathrate was 112 the stational inva 
lidingrate 316 and the final invaliding at Netley 374 Valve 
disease of the heart gave during these five years nearly half the 
admissions more than half of the deaths and twothirds of the 
final invaliding in this class In the later war period 187880 the 
annual ratio of admissions for diseases of the circulatory system 
was 2093 the deathrate 1J3 the stational invalidingrate 939 
and the final invaliding at Netley 455 There are no dtalo carry 
out the comparison farther 
Deputy SurgeonGeneral Woolfryes remarks of the Galeaka 
Gaika war that palpitation was common amongst the young soldiers  
brought on by overexertion and excessive fatigue while  muscu 
lar rheumatism so common in South Africa did not affect soldiers 
in the field to any appreciable extent The 99th Regiment which 
was relieved from active service in Zululand and proceeded to Ber 
muda carried with it this tendency to palpitation  while in the 
88th Regiment at Mauritius cases of valvular disease of the heart 
occurred attributed to  the hardships and overexertion undergone 
by that corps while on active service at the Cape of Good Hope 
Taking the year 1869 which gives the highest number of ad 
missions deaths and invaliding in the second quinquennial period 
of the decade on the table it will be found that diseases of the 
circulatory system gave a high ratio for that year at home in the 
depot battalions of the line and the depot brigade R A  valve 
disease hypertrophy and palpitation being the prevailing forms 
The comment is made   The excess in the artillery may probably 
be to some extent a result of the duties of the men and in the 
depot brigade and depot battalions it may be a consequence of tropi 
cal service of age and of the habits of the old soldier 
As a rule in India the depots give a high admissionrate for dis 
eases of the circulation  invalids convalescents and pensioners 
being tempted to indulge in the cheap spirit of the country and  
intemperance accordingly prevailing la the foregoing observa 
tions my object ris been rather to bring forward the wear aaid 
tear of a soldiers avocation than to lay stress on his vices rand  
irregularities tho effects of syphilis being better understood in 
regard to the production of aneurysm and dilatations than valve 
disease   
Hypertrophy of the heart comes second in the list in point 
of importance among the organic diseases of the heart causing

2474 admissions 151 deaths and 803 invalided In the home 
army this disability is evenly distributed throughout the ten years  
each quinquennial period giving as compared with other groups of 
stations a small admissionrate the smallest deathrate and the 
highest invalidingvrate due to the number of immature recruits dis 
charged the service under this head Among the troops abroad 
there is a remarkable diminution in the admissions and deaths with 
an increase in the invaliding in the second quinquennial period 
probably due to the mtroduction of the term palpitation in the 
nomenclature of 1869 
The phenomena of dilatation and hypertrophy vary according to 
which condition predominates and both are frequently associated 
with palpitation Dr Maclean writing in the report for 1867 of 
151 cases of heartdisease under his observation at Netley remarks 
82 were under 30 3 between 30 and 40 the youngest 16 the 
oldest 40 In only 6 was there a history of acute rheumatism  22 
had a distinct history of syphilis and 1 of gout In 72 the aortic 
valves were diseased with more or less hypertrophy of the left ven 
tricle when the disease was aortic obstruction In 54 the mitral 
valve was affected in25 there was palpitation often with dilatation of 
the right side of th heart The Cape group India and China show 
the highest admissionrates troops at sea in the West Indies the 
Cape and India the highest deathrates  and troops at home the 
highest invalidingrate In the home returns the annual average 
is 88 admissions 5 deaths and 41 invalided with no great in 
equality Its causes apart from valvelesions and obstructions from 
disease of the great channels have been ably discussed by Mr 
Myers in his Alexander Prize Essay in which he has fully shown 
the evils of the mechanical obstruction induced by the soldiers 
dress and accoutrements in exercising a special influence not at 
work among civilians Surgeon Dvy has contributed a short 
essay written in 1877 to elucidate still farther the special con 
ditions by which mechanical obstruction and excessive strain are 
induced in the recruit He discusses the effects of the artificial 
dilatation of the chest in preliminary settingup drill and the sub 
sequent trainingfour hours a day for six monthsas  
certain to 
lay the foundation of much heartdisease in the army with or with 
out the present uniform His argumentis that hypertrophy com 
mences in the drillfield th abnormally distended chest causing 
shallow respiration an excited action of the right ventricle and 
irregularity of the cardiac rhythmical movements the diminished 
expiratory acts disturbing the balance of both pulmonary and syste 
mic circulations and thereby embarrassing the right side of the 
heart which is over distended with venous blood the consequence 
being that when the recruit is made to double dyspnoea becomes 
apparent excessive strain with corresponding cardiac exhaustion 
results and in the end hypertrophy of the right ventricle with or 
without dilatation The impeded respiratory movement is the 
starting point of the sequence  the training exercises induce exces 
sive museular pressure on thevenous system and the recruit is thus 
 
the victim of the drillsergeants ignorance and superstition 
The injudicious handling of recruits at drill was attacked in 1862 
in a report by the Prof essors of the Army Medical School Atrophy 
of the heart appears as the cause of 53 admissions 15 deaths and 4 
invalided 35 of the admissions and 8 of the deathsoccurred in India  
Dilatation of the heart occasioned 35 admissions 15 deaths and

27 invalided of whom 20 admissions 7 deaths and 18 invalided are 
in the returns from India Fatty degeneration of the heart has 
given rise to 106 admissions 121 deaths many of them sudden 
without doubt and 25 invalided In the first quinquennial period 
the term in use is degeneration but I have here arranged them under 
the one heading The men most liable to this disability are those 
employed as canteen and mess waiters or in situations where tip 
pling habits may be indulged in with considerable impunity The 
effect of loss of tone from nervous exhaustion induced by malaria 
tropical service etc is seen in the higher admissionrates in India 
than at home The deathrate and invalidingrate are almost equal 
in both armies The small admission and high deathrate indicate 
a disease which is insidious in its progress and rapid in its fatal 
termination The abuse of alcoholic liquors the effects of over 
feeding in warm climates and the tendency to inactive habits en 
gendered by excessive solar heat account for the predisposition to 
weak flabby fatty hearts so often exhibited in soldiers returning 
from foreign service These points have been fully insisted on by 
a succession of able administrative medical officers in India 
Aneurysm of the heart is given as the cause of 30 admissions 8 
deaths and 1 invalided Madras is credited with half the admis 
sions and half the deaths in one year which is singular if not due 
to an error in the returns 
Rupture of the heart has occasioned 5 admissions and 13 deaths 
4 admissions and 6 deaths being from India 
Angina pectoris figures largely in the first quinquennial period 
causing 216 admissions and but 52 in the second  nearly twothirds 
are from India There are 8 deaths and 28 invalided in the 
decade To be continued 
EXPERIMENTS ON THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS ON 
THE EXCRETION OF UREA AND URIC ACID 
By EDMUND ALLEYNE COOK LRCPEd LRCSED 
Continued from page 8580 
Action of Powdered Malt on the Excretion of Urea and Uric Acid 
The commencement of this set of experiments was somewhat irre 
gular inasmuch as the excretion of uric acid was not normal in 
amount when the administration of the maltpowder was com 
menced and the experiments were somewhat marred by a meeting 
in close rooms which had its own influence on the excretion The 
experiments were commenced November 17th 1881 immediately 
after the last tomato experiments and when the uric acid excretion 
which had been sent up to 193 grains had gradually decreased to 
153 grains

On the 16th the first dose of maltpowdersifted to free it from 
large Truskswas taken in the evening The diet was as stated in 
former papers and the quantity of liquid consumed was about six 
ounces more ie fifty ounces On the 17th after each meal half a 
teaspoonful of maltpowder was taken and the diet in all other 
respects was without variation All day a semiheadache was expe 
rienced such as would ordinarily be expected with constipated 
bowels but the bowels continued regular On the 18th the same 
amount of malt in the same manner as also on the 19th but a 
meeting was attended on the evening of the 19th No change of 
diet On the 20th the regular doses of malt were taken and again 
on the 21st and then its administration was discontinued When 
the malt administration began the health was perfect The second 
day an illdefined headache and sense of bodily fulness was expe 
rienced and this continued more or less throughout the administra 
tion  the bowels were regular and the exercise and sleep as usual 
Setting aside the meeting which apparently caused the large in 
crease of uric acid in the collection of the 20th the effect of the 
maltpowder seems to have been to increase the urea excretion con 
siderably and the uric acid also There was no other assignable 
cause for the excretion continuing so much above the normal than 
the use of the malt and on the cessation of its use the amount 
excreted fell The amount of malt used would not itself produce 
uric acid or urea but the action of its diastase on the food would  
convert the cooked starchy material into maltose much more com 
pletely than would ordinary digestion and this being conveyed to 
the liver and probably stored as glycogen would increase the liver 
activity and if the urea be a product of liveraction the increase 
would be explained These experiments jure perhaps best considered 
in conjunction with the following 
Action of Pepsin on the Elimination of Urea and Uric Acid

Christmas irregularities of diet interfered with and confused the 
conclusion of these experiments 
On each day pepsinelixir of Symes and Co of Liverpool was 
taken in three separate doses of one drachm after each meal the 
digestion and bodily health being perfect On the second day after 
commencing the pepsin there existed a feeling of great depression 
and restlessness with feverishness and this continued on the 20th 
but in less degree On the 20th eight ounces more water were 
taken and also on the 21st 
These experiments with maltpowder and with pepsin are by no 
 means perfect but they point to an increase of both urea and uric 
acid caused by the administration  and since the administration 
j may be presumed to cause increased liveraction because of more 
perfect digestion and there exists nothing in either malt or pepsin 
in the doses given sufficient to produce by its presence the increased 
excretion noted the tendency of these results is to fix the production 
of both nrea and uric acid on the liver or if we cannot go so far as 
that we may say that increased liveraction is coincident with in 
creased excretion of these substances It must be noted that the 
increased liveraction was caused by increased nutrition ie an in 
crease of nutritive material must have been carried to that organ 
although the same diet was continued because the diet was better 
digested 
To throw a little more light on the subject in November 1882 
with a diet in most respects similar and of great regularity the fol 
lowing was tried

On October 31st no drug was taken On November 1st one grain 
of euonymin brown was taken on an empty stomach and in solu 
tion On the second this dose was repeated and again on the 3rd 
On the 4th and 5th no drug The life was regular and the increase 
of uric acid must be put down to the euonymin It is seen there is 
no notable increase of urea Now euonymin is reported to be a 
pure excitant of the liver and has no other action which has been 
well studied or which is prominent The elimination of uric acid 
after increasing is seen to decrease in spite of the continued ad 
ministration of the drug but it must be remembered that euonymin 
produces an increased action of the bowels and this would carry off 
water and doubtless other material which would otherwise pass by 
the kidneys This looseness began on the 3rd and continued ne 
cessitating the conclusion of the experiment 
It has been proved that when th liver is eliminated from the 
general circulation the secretion of urine is entirely suppressed 
and only recommences on injecting urea into the general circula 
tion  hence has been deduced the proposition that the liver is the 
seat of urea formation Parkes states his belief that urea is largely 
formed in the liver and that in acute disease the deficiency is in 
proportion to the amount of liver involved I have not been able 
to ascertain whether this observation has been continued to the 
elimination of uric acid though of course if the secretion of urine 
ceases when the liver is eliminated from the circulation the excre 
tion of uric acid must cease also 
The question whether urea and uric acid are converted the one 
into the other in the animal organism has been often discussed 
and as often left unproved Parkes remarks uThile the complete 
destruction of uric acid introduced into the body is quite certainr 
it is as certain that uric acid or some amount of it produced in the 
body is not so destroyed but passes off with the urine1 Why should 
we not suppose that the unknown conditions which in this case pro 
tect the uric acid may be also protective if uric acid is formed 
directly from food 1 In other words is the parallel drawn between
