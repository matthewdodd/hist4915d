thus  Zero that of ice and salt mixed 8 for freezing 24o for 
the human body and 53o for boiling He then further ex 
tended the scale by dividing each degree into four parts so if 
it is multiplied by four we have the scale now in use 32o for 
freezing 96o for the body and 212o for boiling In this way 
the thermometer seems to have been evolved Subsequently 
these degrees were still found to be too large for accurate 
measurement and so were divided into ten parts each This 
is a modern innovation for the decimal system did not come 
into vogue for many years after Fahrenheits time 
This information is gained from the Encyclopedia Britan 
nica and I apprehend that the writer of the article must have 
obtained it from authentic sourcesfrom the writings of 
Fahrenheit himself or from some of his contemporaries 
His thermometer which I always regarded as an abomina 
tion is now looked upon by me with a great and twofold 
interest Its scale being founded on the temperature of the 
body and this naturally under the duodecimal system receiv 
ing the round number 12 became the point from which every 
other number proceeded The paper does not state how the 
temperature of the body was ascertained  possibly in various 
ways which accounts for the figures being not quite accurate 
and not in accordance with the fixed figure on our modern 
instrument Newton however is careful to say the ex 
ternal 
 
heat of the body 
Another Theory of Fahrenheits Scale 
Some amount of doubt must still remain as to the explana 
tion of the scale which I have given seeing that no mention 
of its origin is to be found in scientific books and the account 
given in Brandes Dictionary of Chemistry is of a totally dif 
ferent kind althongh the author of the article hesitates in 
attributing it to Fahrenheit It is said therein  that the 
1800 between freezing and boiling was chosen by Fahrenheit 
or probably Reaumurfor some of his experiments on the 
expansion of mercury When he plunged his thermometer 
into melting snow the 11156 parts of mercury which it con 
tained expanded when placed in boiling water to 11336 being 
an increase of 180 parts This is said to be the origin of 
Fahrenheits scale the constructor carrying it still lower 
when he found he could obtain a greater degree of cold In 
this account it is not stated why he used this amount of 
mercury and therefore it can only be inferred that it was the 
quantity contained in the bulb It is difficult to understand 
how a scientific man could have adopted so arbitrary a 
method and therefore probably the description is incomplete 
It may be remarked that Newton experimented in the same 
way and his results are mentioned in the paper referred to  
he there showed the increased space which 1000 parts of oil 
occupied when raised to the temperature of the human body or that of boiling water 
Conclusion 
I should like to say that I am inclined to put full credence 
in the account I have taken from the Encyclopedia Britannica 
as to the origin of Fahrenheits thermometer and although I 
know that sentiment should have no place in a scientific 
investigation I cannot but hope that it is correct for I must 
admit that to a certain extent my wish is father to the 
thought For the future whenever I see a thermometer in 
use to mark the temperature of the body I shall be reminded 
that it was first used for this purpose in order to mark the 
starting point of the scale from which all other temperatures were to be reckoned At the same time there will be the 
pleasing remembrance that it was our great Newton who in 
all probability suggested the temperature of the body as the 
starting or determinate point in the thermometer and mark 
ing it by the round number 12

HOSPITAL REFORM 
The Medical Guild Manchester has issued the following 
report on the subject of hospital reform to the Board of every 
hospital and dispensary in Manchester  
The Medical Guild is impressed with the difficulties surrounding this 
question but is convinced that reform lies along the lines indicated by the recommendations appended 
The difficulties lie chiefly in the fitness or otherwise of the various 
applicants who present themselves at our hospitals The fitness must be 
viewed from the standpoint of professional or medical exigencies as well 
as from the point of view of charity 
The Guild considers that the present methods of investigation through 
the agency of the District Provident Society and by means of such hos 
pital officials as are employed are unsatisfactory because the investiga 
tion is not thorough and is limited to a small area and also because the  
poverty scale is not the same for all the hospitals 
The Guild is further of opinion that by far the greater number of those 
attending the outpatient department do not require any special treat 
ment and only waste the time and energy of the hospital staff 
The Guild considers that the charges exacted lrom patients are wrong 
in principle and bad in effect 
The Guild is of opinion that the treatment of home patients does not 
come within the sphere of the legitimate work of the hospitals and could 
be better carried out by other means 
The Guild regrets that a large amount of hospital abuse is due to medical 
practitioners who particularly in country districts send patients to 
hospitals who could afford to do without medical charity 
The Medical Guild recommends  
i That the investigation of the financial suitability of the applicants 
seeking relief at all medical charities should be the work of a 
Central Board and that in every case in which investigation is 
decided upon it should be done thoroughly 
2 That all trivial cases should be dismissed after the first attend 
ance and that they and all accidents which should receive 
firstaid should if not detained as inpatients and if not fit 
objects of charity receive no further treatment but be referred 
to other sources 
3 That all recommends should be discontinued each application 
being dealt with on its own merits 
4 That the exaction of any payment whatsoever from patients 
should be entirely abolished 
5 That the home visiting of patients should be discontinued and 
more suitable arrangements made

UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON 
The Medical Society 
Bias in Clinical Medicine 
The annual public night of the University College Medical 
Society was held on October 17th when an address was 
given by Dr Judson S Bury on Bias in Clinical Medicine 
who said that many errors in medicine were due to bias The 
word bias appeared to come from an old French word biais 
meaning oblique or slanting As a rule it was used to denote a 
onesided tendency of the mind It was to be observed that the 
term usually implied error as when it was said that the judgment 
was biassed When a judgment or opinion was correct it was said 
that it was good or sound very rarely that it was biassed in 
the right direction In extreme cases a man was said to look 
at things in such a biassed manner that the afflicted person 
might be deemed to possess what Oliver Wendell Holmes 
called a squinting brain The causes that fixed the mind in 
one direction often unconsciously closing it to the considera 
tion of more than one or two aspects were in part congenital 
and in part acquired In cases of congenital bias the sufferer 
appeared to be devoid of any power of observation He could 
see things but could not observe and was unable to analyse 
and form a judgment on the various impressions received by 
his senses Acquired bias might affect a mind of good average 
development  imperfect education was one of the chief 
causes Scientific subjects were better taught now than 
formerly but in Dr Burys opinion there was still a 
good deal lacking in the methods adopted for the training 
of men for medical work Passing next to the bias of 
authority the speaker said that he included in that phrase all 
the statements with regard to disease and its nomenclature to 
be found in the best medical books Medical knowledge 
already in their possession while certainly tending to the 
advancement of medical science acted in some degree also as 
a retarding agent and a new discovery in medicine might divert the mind too much in one direction and might thus 
impair the comprehensive view so necessary for real advance 
Dr Bury illustrated this point by describing in detail the 
history of peripheral neuritis and declared that the remedy 
was to strive to acquire a scientific habit of mind Students 
of medicine would best secure this by passing some time in 
original research not with the expectation of making a 
discovery but for the building up of a scientific habit of 
thought Dr Bury then proceeded to discuss the ques 
tion of the correctness of the terms curable and incur 
able disease After quoting some remarkable cases he 


14 mbjS2U INTRODUCTORY ADDRESSESOct 20 1900 
pointed out that an attack of illness however slight might 
leave behind it some weak spot which after months or even 
years might be attacked by a toxin or other irritating agent 
and become the startingpoint of some chronic progressive dis 
ease On the other hand severe organic disease was not 
always fatal for occasionally the morbid process was arrested 
and in exceptional cases even completely cured The bias of 
inclination was well exemplified in a certain writer who had 
collected a number of cases of the disease which he was in 
vestigating and found that the greater proportion of the fea 
tures presented by those cases supported a definite view to 
which the writer himself was much inclined The inclination 
was to make deductions not simply from the facts observed 
but from the facts suiting his own expectations and wishes 
Commenting on the bias of specialism he considered that the 
throat ear eye and brain specialist should remember the re 
lation of any particular organ to the other parts of the body The 
bias of physical signs came last in the list and it was not tobe 
pretended that a complete examination of any patient had 
been made till they had studied the chief influences to which 
his organism had been exposed in the past and had fully 
considered its present condition together with its capacity 
for existence and health in the future The impaired vitality 
and declining strength of a mother who has lost her only child 
were not revealed by physical signs and chemical tests and 
could not be adequately treated by drugs  but the doctor who 
had studied humanity as well as the pathology of tissues 
would recognise that the mothers mind was affecting her 
body and would know that kindness with sunlight and 
change were the remedies to help to keep life going till time 
had healed the wound Sympathy for suffering was some 
times as necessary for a correct diagnosis as for successful 
treatment In conclusion Dr Bury said that the preventive 
treatment of bias consisted of three thingsnamely care 
doubt and truth The doubt he referred to was the true 
scientific doubt involving the intention to arrive at a 
certainty 
MEATH HOSPITAL DUBLIN 
Tuberculosis in Ireland 
Dr James Craig Physician to the hospital who delivered 
the introductory address chose as his subject Pulmonary Con 
sumption in Ireland 
Dr Craig opened his address by referring to the loss which 
the hospital had suffered by the deaths of Sir William Stokes 
and Mr Glasgow Patteson surgeons to the hospital and of 
Dr Arthur Wynne Foot who had been for twentyone years 
physician to the hospital previous to his retirement in 1892 
Turning to the main topic of his address he said  
Prevalence of Pulmonary Consumption in Ireland 
Nearly 10000 people in Ireland die every year from pul 
monaryConsumption and these numbers do not include 3000 
more who succumb to other forms of tuberculosis Dublin 
itself with a population of 350000 is responsible for some 
1300 deaths per annum and Belfast with practically the 
same population is a good second with over 1100 fatal cases 
in the year On an average therefore 24 inhabitants of this 
city die every week from a disease which is now regarded as 
preventable Several facts in connection with this astounding 
mortality are worthy of notice 
x In England the deathrate from consumption has been showing a 
steady decrease for the last twenty years whereas in Ireland the reduc 
tion has been scarcely appreciable 
2 The deathrate in London from phthisis is less than onehalf of that 
which obtains in Dublin 
3 The fatalities in our city from a combination of tho principal 
zymotic or infectious diseases are fewer than those caused by consumption 
4 The victims of consumption are chiefly the men and women between 
25 and 35 years of age who are the most active workers and breadwinners 
in the community 
Dr Craig then referred to the mode in which the disease is 
acquired and spread and to the necessity for the disinfection 
of rooms which had been occupied by persons suffering from 
pulmonary consumption He then passed on to consider the 
methods which should be adopted to prevent the spread of 
the disease 
The teachers he said in the primary schools who them 
selves will instruct the young must be taught the importance 
of sunshine fresh air free ventilation and cleanliness in the 
prevention of consumption The Jubilee nurses afford one of 
the readiest means of directly carryin into the homes of the 
poor the information as to the dangerous character of tuber 
culous expectoration the necessity for ventilation fresh air 
and whatever isolation may be possible The employers of 
labour in whose places of business numbers of workpeople 
are congregated together must see to the proper heating and 
ventilation of the rooms to the banishment of dust and to 
the destruction of expectoration 
Every movement for improving the homes of the poor and 
every organisation to lessen the waste of money in the con 
sumption of drink should be encouraged 
The sanitary authorities should undertake a roomtoroom 
and housetohouse dissemination of circulars containing prac 
ticable advice to be followed by persons infected The excel 
lent principle adopted by our Medical Superintendent Officer 
of Health to encourage a voluntary notification of the disease 
and the disinfection of the clothing and homes of those who 
suffer from or have succumbed to its ravages should be ren 
dered compulsory throughout the entire country Finally 
more stringent measures are required than at present exist to 
prevent the sale of tuberculous meat and milk or their con 
tamination by attendants who are themselves consumptive 
Classification of the Consumptive Poor 
I propose to divide the consumptive poor whose circum 
stances I desire to discuss into three groups  
i Those who in an early stage of the disease offer a fair expectation 
of cure and are willing to subject themselves to isolation and treatment 
2 The consumptives who are the breadwinners of a family and are 
therefore compelled to remain in their homes and engage in their daily 
work whUe any strength remains to them 
3 Those who in the latest stages of the disease are no longer fit to work 
and for whom a hope of cure is practically impossible 
In regard to the first class there is positively no accommo 
dation provided in connection with this city to which pauper 
consumptives can look for treatment and a hope of cure I 
fully recognise the good work which is already being done by 
the Consumptive Hospital at Newcastle but it is not available 
to pauper inmates and it contains only thirtytwo beds 
The second class is a large one The individual probably 
occupies a room in a tenement house where there is no 
attempt at reasonable isolation especially by night and so 
the other members of the family are almost certain to become 
infected  
The case of the third class is the most pitiable of all and 
represents the final stages of the others The sufferers are no 
longer able to work are absolutely without means are in the 
most infective stage of the disease the general hospital is no 
place for their reception and the convalescent homes in con 
nection with the city have one and all decided to close their 
doors against them What therefore are the prospects to 
which they may look forward for the remainder of their lives  
To remain halfstarved in their miserable homes spreading 
the infection to any members of the household who have still 
escaped it  in a few instances to gain admission to the hospice 
for the dying or finally to become unwilling inmates of the 
union hospital where the conditions however excellent are 
by no means the most suitable for the amelioration of the 
symptoms of advanced consumption I do not in the fore 
going category include the Incurable Hospital for although a 
most excellent organisation prevails there still it is intended 
for a better class of patients than I am referring to and a 
considerable amount of interest is required before admission 
can be obtained 
The problem then which confronts usand it is one which 
the public health authorities in the city must conscientiously 
endeavour to solveis by what methods the circumstances of 
each of the three classes whose position I have attempted to 
define can be most effectively improved 
Sanatoria 
Sanatoria however rude should be provide where fresh 
air and shelter may be available in the treatment of adults 
and children for whom a cure would be reasonably expected 
France in addition to several sanatoria for adults has pro 
vided by private subscription two splendid institutions with 
350 beds available for consumptive boys  and over twenty 
seaside sanatoria very much like our own convalescent homes 
exist where from two to three thousand children with a con 
sumptive tendency are capable of being accommodated and 
restored to health 
Germany in 1895 had only two sanatoria and two small

houses where the poorer classes could be received for hygienic 
treatment but in the three years which followed nearly 
thirty of these institutions were established and that too 
indirectly by the poor themselves  for on account of the law 
which enforces compulsory insurance against sickness and 
old age on all whose annual income is less than 150 per 
annum the insurance companies were quick to realise that 
the readiest way to save themselves from the disbursement of 
sick pay was to expend a large share of the premiums they 
received in the provision of sanatoria for the treatment of 
consumption The result is that At the present time 
every large town and every district in Germany has its 
local sanatoria society and often already its own sana 
torium 
Russia was aroused to a sense of its duty in 1895 by a report 
from the medical practitioners of Petersburg as to the need of 
sanatoria for the treatment of the consumptive poor and an 
appeal was made to the public for funds This was followed 
by the formation of a Society under distinguished patronage 
to which the Emperor Nicholas II contributed a sum of nearly 
50000 for the erection and maintenance of a sanatorium in 
memory of the Empress Maria Alexandrovna who was herself 
a victim of consumption and in addition to this he handed 
over to the Society a large property of his own on which a famous 
sanatorium has since been placed Many more of these institu 
tions have been also provided which are supported by indi 
vidual and public generosity by local rates and by church 
collections 
In Noricay the popular present to the King in commemora 
tion of the twentyfifth anniversary of his accession to the 
throne amounting to upwards of 100000 was chiefly devoted 
by him to the establishment of sanatoria for the consumptive 
poor In that country too I may say in passing compulsory 
notification of the disease has become law and many useful 
reforms have been enacted to prevent the spread of the 
disease 
Stoitzerland AustriaHungary America the Colonies andin 
fact every civilised country on the globe is making provision 
for the proper hygienic treatment of consumption 
In Ireland what has been done although deserving of the 
highest praise is microscopic in comparison to the needs of 
the community Dublin with nearly 1300 deaths in the 
year from consumption more than half of which are among 
the strictly poor can boast of the hospital in County Wicklow 
with its 32 beds which have been provided and are main 
tained by public and individual generosity aided by the 
minimum charge of 5s per week which the inmates are called 
upon to pay  and Belfast with a mortality of 1100 per annum 
has 40 beds at its command in the hospital which was erected 
through the munificent contribution of i3ooo by the late 
Mr Forster Green There the provision for the poor in 
Ireland who might hope to be cured ends I have no desire 
to propound visionary or impossible suggestions  on the con 
trary I am prepared to admit that we must content ourselves 
with small but gradual improvements The hospital at New 
castle is capable of great extension let it be supported by 
every legitimate means known to the charitable public let 
the ratepayers of the city and county at large be taxed with a 
small additional sum for this deserving purpose and soon we 
shall find ourselves in a position to maintain not only 100 
beds at Newcastle but several further hundreds in ruder 
shelters where consumptives among the very poor may not 
be denied the curative influences of fresh air and wholesome 
food 
Housing of the Poor 
I am beset with apparently insurmountable difficulties 
when I approach the task of attempting to suggest any cer 
tain methods by which members of a family who inhabit a 
single room can be prevented from acquiring the disease 
when one of their number who has become infected is com 
pelled to continue to work The real difficulty lies in the 
necessity for isolation at night The evil would be minimised 
if due regard were observed in the matter of ventilation the 
frequent boiling of clothes and the destruction of expectora 
tion by fire  but as these precautions are almost unattainable 
it is a question whether it would not be possible for the public 
health authority either to provide a separate room in the same 
tenement house in which the infected person might sleep or 
to set apart special houses which under their own immediate 
supervision might be utilised by victims of the disease who 
fear to spread the infection to their relatives 
This matter I understand is being considered by the 
Medical Superintendent Officer of Health and a few members 
of the Public Health Committee of the city but practical 
suggestions on the subject from other sources would I am 
certain be gladly welcomed by them 
The pitiable condition of those who in the latest stages of 
the disease are past work are probably infecting others and 
have no prospect before them but the hospice for the dying 
or the union hospital is that which most directly appeals to 
myself in my daily work at hospital Homes akin to the 
hospice are an absolute necessity and the plain duty of the 
Public Health Committee is to draw the attention of the 
Corporation to the state of affairs which exists in the city 
namely that numbers of respectable halfstarved consumpn 
tives who are a menace to public health require a spot i3 
which to end their da vs and for which the union hospit 
may be considered sufficiently adequate but where they cer 
tainly are unwilling to die 
Backward State of Sanitation in Ireland 
Let me quote the hopeful words of Dr F R Walters tcr 
whose work on Sanatoria for Consumptives I am much in 
debted He says in reference to Great Britain Our 
countrys sanitary past has been great and fruitful and there 
is every reason to hope that with growing consciousness of 
the possibility of destroying this dread scourge of humanity 
by the abolition of town smoke the improvement of our dwel 
lings the better ventilation of rooms and streets the admis 
sion of sunshine into our midst the inculcation of more 
rational habits of life the destruction of sputa the erection 
of sanatoria and in many other ways she will gradually pre 
pare for herself a still more great and glorious future 
This bright picture I am sorry to say does not extend to 
Ireland for the neglect of sanitation is undoubtedly the cause 
of our great mortality from consumption  nor are the prospects 
for the future so encouraging as they might be The condition 
of the city of Kilkenny as given to the public a few days ago 
does not tend to diminish the stream of emigration from our 
shores or engender much hope for improved sanitation in the 
futureno proper water supply no system of sewerage cocases 
of diphtheria in the past year typhus and enteric fever always 
prevalent and the Urban Council ignoring for years the 
reports of their medical officers of health and of the inspectors 
of the Local Government Board as to the sanitary needs of 
the town 
I have no hesitation in saying that the action of the Govern 
ment in the administration which is again about to take office 
is responsible for the neglected condition of sanitary reform 
throughout Ireland The promoters of the Local Government 
Act of 1898 obstinately refused to put this country on an equal 
footing with England or Scotland They refused to accede to 
the representations of the Irish College of Physicians to 
render it even permissive for county councils to appoint 
medical superintendent officers of health over a county or a 
group of counties who as experts and independent of private 
practice would have in conjunction with the existing medical 
officers of health done more in one year to establish efficient 
sanitation throughout the country than can ever be effected 
by the present organisation 
Dr Craig then referred to the fact that the two clinical 
medals offered by the medical staff of the hospital had been 
won by lady students and to the prospects of ladies now enter 
ing the profession  
QUEENS COLLEGE BELFAST 
Address by Dr McKisack 
The winter session of the medical school of the College and 
various teaching hospitals has opened It is too early to be 
able to judge the probable number of entries The medical 
professors delivered their opening lectures on October 16th 
and the classes were well attended  on the same morning the 
formal opening of the session of the medical school was made 
at the Royal Victoria Hospital when Dr McKisack delivered 
the address and welcomed the students on behalf of the staff 
His opening sentences struck a note of sorrow when he feel 
ingly referred to the loss the school had so recently sustained 
in the death of Dr Strafford Smith he then expressed the

regret they must all feel at the retirement of Dr Henry 
OSeill Turning to the future Dr McKisack gave a suc 
cinct account of the new hospital whose foundation stone is 
so shortly to be laid by the Prince of Wales  but he warned 
the students that while a thoroughly equipped modern hos 
pital was of enormous advantage to them yet earnest en 
deavour on the part of both teacher and student was the 
essential factor of success  many a discovery had been made 
and much real knowledge gained with simple and very im 
perfect apparatus Scientific methods of diagnosis supple 
mented but did not supplant the education of the senses 
The student was urged to abide closely by the curriculum 
marked out for him which was the product of many years 
experience in the various arrangements for teaching to enter 
earnestly into the somewhat dull routine of methodical case 
taking to follow up their cases and lose no opportunity of 
repeated examination  the necessity of regularity and punc 
tuality was enforced and the great wisdom of economy of 
time The inestimable advantage of residence in a hospital 
was pointed out and all students advised to compete for such 
a position before entering into practice The serious advree 
was given in a light and happy style most suitable to the occa 
sion and put the audience in the best of humour Besides 
the staff and College medical professors several practitioners 
came to witness the commencement of another winters cam

UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH 
Address by Professor Wyllie 
Professor Wyllie delivered his inaugural address in the 
McEwan Hall Sir William Muir presided and was accom 
panied on the rostrum by several members of the Senatus 
Academicus He devoted his address to a history of the 
Chair of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh The great 
feature of the Edinburgh School was that its various teachers 
and professors had been from time to time men of the greatest 
eminence and influencemen whose work had advanced the 
science of medicine and whose teaching had established the 
reputation of the University as a great medical school One 
of theseWilliam Cullenwas in his own day the leading 
physician and the most eminent teacher of medicine in 
Europe he was one of the great outstanding figures in the 
history of medicine Professor Wyllie then paid a warm 
tribute to his immediate predecessor Sir Thomas Grainger 
Stewart who had left to the profession works which would be 
a monument to him and a name and a memory which would 
be worthy to be ranked with those of his distinguished pre 
decessors in the chair Of these seven in number Professor 
Wyllie in turn spoke No fewer than seventeen professors 
sprang from the remarkable family of Gregory 
Professor Chiene on Hospitals in South Africa 
Professor John Chiene gave the introductory address to the 
class of Surgery in the McEwan Hall There was a large 
audience composed of leading members of the Senatus 
Academicus the Lord Provost of Edinburgh members of the 
medical profession and Town Council former pupils and pre 
sent students 
Edinburgh Men in South Africa 
When he arrived in South Africa Professor Chiene found 
himself among old students of the Edinburgh school He 
then understood as never so fully before the power of that 
school its imperial character and the strong bond of union 
that existed between its members Even in St Helena he 
came across an Edinburgh man Dr Roe doing good work in 
charge of the Boer sick Everywhere he went he found old 
pupilssome who had gone out since the war began some 
who had settled in the country All were glad to see him and 
those who had been in charge of the Boer ambulances were 
specially glad On his arrival at Capetown he was appointed 
Consultant in the Capetown District and his principal work 
lay at Wynberg Nos i and 2 General Hospitals and at 
Rondesbosch No 3 General Hospital In all these hospitals 
he saw both British and Boer wounded and it was scarcely 
necessary to say that no difference was made in their treat 
ment by medical officers nurses and orderlies Some of the 
most serious cases were Boers He always found them most 
grateful for all that was done for them Claremont Wood 
stock Greenpoint Simons town and Stellensbosch were aso 
visited 
Bullet Wounds 
He was struck by the number of cases of arteriovenous 
aneurysm by the cases of hsBmothorax rarely ending in em 
pyema by the numerous cases of hernia demanding operation 
for radical cure and by the fact that the great majority of 
bullet wounds healed by first intention and that bullets 
passed through the cavities of the body without any apparent 
damage One case made a great impression on him A 
soldier lying on his face was struck by a Mauser bullet The 
bullet entered above the left clavicle and passed through the 
thorax and abdomen and was removed from Scarpas triangle 
on the right side No bad results followedtruly an ana 
tomical problem worthy of Sir William Turners attention 
The bullet wounds at close range were more severe than 
those at a distance Possibly the bullet might oscillate for 
400 yards and then steady down to pass right through the 
tissues soft and bony making a wound in the skin like a 
leech bite and with little distinction between the apertures 
of entrance and exit Shrapnel cases were the worst Shrap 
nel and lyddite as the Boers told him were their two fears  
they had no fear of the bullets Patients in the wards were 
divided into two classesthose who wished to get back and 
fight and those who wished to be sent home The first class 
were aseptic surgical cases the second class those who suf 
fered from surgical sepsis and from medical maladies espe 
cially dysentery 
Emergency and Temporary Hospitals 
Regarding his visit to Kimberley in May he said that every 
thing seemed to him to be done to make the patients in the 
extemporised hospitals comfortable But here it was that he 
was first brought face to face with the municipal problemto 
what extent was it advisable to crowd a town with enteric 
patients  During Mr Chienes subsequent visit to Pretoria 
Mr Esselen formerly AttorneyGeneral to the South African 
Republic and an old dresser of his who took to the law com 
plained to him of the contamination of that town When 
could these buildings be again used for their original pur 
poses P What form of fumigation and cleansing would be re 
quired to disinfect and purify them   
Hospitals said Sir 
James Simpson should be built of wood and should be 
burned every ten years He had often thought that schools 
and halls connected with churches should be burned from 
time to time The future of South Africa depended on two 
thingsirrigation of the land and destruction of the dejecta 
In passing a word of commendation was given to No 11 
General Hospital outside Kimberley in the erection of which 
the De Beers Company had given valuable assistance Mr 
Chiene then referred to the kindness he had received at the 
hands of MajorGeneral Sir Archibald Hunter of his some 
what risky journey to Mafeking after its relief in the company 
of his old Edinburgh friend Dr W H Steele who was taking 
up the aray apparatus They were warmly welcomed as the 
medical relief column from the south and were able to give 
much help Dr Cameron Dunlop who had charge of a Boer 
ambulance at Lichtenberg told him that they had few enteric 
cases there Why was this  Were the Boers when children 
or young adults attacked with the disease and then rendered 
partly immune P The Yeomanry Hospital at Deelfontein was 
doing excellent work when he saw it 
Edinburgh and East of Scotland Hospital 
Norvals Pont an important military station guarding the 
bridge over the Orange Ri verhad been used as a camping ground 
from October 1899 first by the Boers when they invaded the 
Colony and again on their retreat they made a stand at this 
place The ground had been used by many thousands of our 
troops on their way north to battle and all the sick had passed 
South through that station The camping ground round 
Norvals Pont was covered with dried enteric and dysenteric 
dejecta Dust storms drove the poison into every nook and 
cranny of tents and huts It was no wonder that they passed 
through suffering but they stuck manfully to their duty and 
he never felt prouder of Edinburgh and the Edinburgh School 
than when he found everyone at his or her post striving to 
mitigate and combat the mischief Precautions had been 
taken from the first Sir James Clark and Mr David Wal

lace refused to take the site that had been allotted to the 
hospital and chose a healthy position on the slope half a 
mile from the station When he arrived Dr Francis D 
Boyd the assistant surgeons nurses dressers and orderlies 
had their hands full and he could not speak in sufficiently 
high terms of their fortitude and endurance Not a 
drop of unboiled water was used and the source of 
the milk supply was very closely looked into 
But it was not a question of either water or milk It was dust 
and flies The dust was inhaled and swallowed the flies 
carried the poison from the latrines to the food and thus in 
fection was carried to the two great absorption areasthe lungs 
and the intestinal canal On October 16th the hospital was 
handed over to the Government and the return of the staff 
might be expected in the middle of November They had 
served their Queen and their country nobly and they had 
ever had before them that they were citizens of no mean city 
that they were there to uphold the credit of their Alma Mater 
and the Royal Infirmary as centres of light and leading The 
patients had been treated exactly as they would have been in 
the Royal Infirmary and City Hospital Thanks to the ready 
assistance of the citizens of Edinburgh and east of Scotland 
given to the Lord Provost and his Committee every comfort was 
available and everything that science and kindness could do 
was done In their initial difficulties the military staff officers at 
NorvaPs Pont and elsewhere gave every assistance Professor 
Chiene concluded this part of his address by a kindly and 
feeling reference to Nurse Boyd a sister of Dr Francis D 
Boyd and William Dick a secondclass orderly who had 
both died at their posts 
Bloemfontein and Eroonitadt 
In Bloemfontein when he saw it in July everything 
was very different from what existed when enteric 
was rife and the difficulties of transport were so great 
The same difficulties might have arisen in any large 
town in this country had such a large number of 
patients been suddenly thrust upon them Mr Chiene next 
spoke of the excellent order in which he found part of No 3 
General Hospital at Kroonstadt under Colonel Oswald Wood  
the Scottish Red Cross Hospital under Dr Clark Senior Sur 
geon of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary  the ho3pitals at 
Johannesberg and Pretoria In the lastnamed the Irish 
Hospital under Sir William Thomson was doing invaluable 
work Altogether the share the civil surgeons has taken in 
the late crisis had been a very important one and the help 
they had given to the Army Medical Department could not 
but be looked on with pride by the Empire 
The Railway Service 
The comfort of the hospital trains three of which were 
under the charge of old Edinburgh men was referred to the 
admirable hospital arrangements in Natal and tbe level 
headedness of the central medical authority there The task 
in Cape Colony was simpler since the country was loyal the 
railway service uninterrupted and the distance only 200 to 
300 miles and only 50000 men had to be fed and clothed in 
place of 150000 
The Boer Wounded 
He had seen the Boer wounded at every large centre and 
his last official duty was to visit those who were for the time 
being kept in St Helena The medical profession knew no 
nationality Everyone on whatever side he might be who 
was ill received their help and he felt fully justified in saying 
that the same consideration which was given by the medical 
men on the British side to the Boer wounded was fully re 
ciprocated by the medical men in charge of the Boer ambu 
lances Putting aside foreign ambulances more than 50 per 
cent of those who served as medical men on the Boer side 
were taught in the Edinburgh School 
Hospital Administration 
The whole question of hospital administration in the war 
was still sub judice Everyone who had the medical instinct 
sympathy for the suffering would be willing confidently to 
wait the verdict Let them be thankful that the individual 
members of the profession had done their duty and let them 
wait with equanimity knowing that only good could come 
from a thorough investigation into those charges which had 
stirred the sympathy of the nation Three things had made 
a deep impression on him  First the gratitude bravery and 
patience of the soldiers in hospital  secondly that he had 
never been privileged in the space of six months to give so 
much happiness to his fellow men  and thirdly that at the 
best war was a miserable business We had all lost friends 
We had all suffered By our suffering the Empire had been 
welded together and strengthened 
UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LIVERPOOL 
Distribution of Prizes by the Bishop 
The formal opening of the Medical Faculty of University 
College took place on Saturday October 13th when the 
Bishop of Liverpool Dr Chavasse distributed the medals 
and prizes gained during the last session and delivered the 
introductory address In the course of it he remarked that he 
was glad to show early in his residence in Liverpool his deep 
interest as a university man in the fortunes of the young and 
vigorous University College of Liverpool which he believed 
helped to supply a very real want in that great northern 
city and its neighbourhood and he was persuaded had 
before it a great and fruitful future As the descendant of 
four successive generations of medical men he felt it a 
peculiar privilege to be allowed to meet those who were 
training for a profession which he had venerated from a child 
as one of the noblest on earth He took as the subject of his 
address the life and work of the three great British doctors 
William Harvey John Hunter and Thomas Sydenhamand 
dealt with their careers and characters in a masterly and 
most interesting manner In summing up the lessons 
to be drawn from the examples of these men he said 
that their discoveries and writings had blessed and 
enriched the world and he was not sure whether 
they did not achieve more by their character and example 
They helped to mould the high character of British doctors 
which was the glory of the profession and of the country The 
keen discoverer the patient investigator men of selfsacrifice 
and devotion to duty the generous helper of the poor bore 
witness that God cared for the bodies as well as the souls of 
men Such men had lived in the past and thank God they 
were living still His best wish for the students was that 
they might unite the culture of William Harvey with the 
industry of John Hunter and crown both with the love of 
truth of God and of man which was the glory of Thomas 
Sydenham 
Biennial Dinner 
In the evening the biennial dinner of the Medical Faculty 
took place in the Exchange Station Hotel Covers were laid 
for 160 Sir William Banks President of the Faculty was in 
the chair and the guests included the Lord Bishop of the 
Diocese Dr Chavasse the Lord Mayor of Liverpool Principal 
Oliver Lodge Birmingham Mr Warr MP and Mr E K 
Muspratt It was one of the largest and most successful 
dinners that has ever been held in Liverpool 
UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS 
Owing to the death of the Marquis of Bute the address which 
Principal Donaldson was to have given at the opening of the 
University Session was not actually delivered but it has been 
printed and circulated among the students After alluding 
to the provision made and contemplated for the women 
students of the University he discussed the question of 
medical education at St Andrews For many years the only 
subjects of the medical curriculum taught at St Andrews 
were botany and zoology and the rest were taught in connec 
tion with the Infirmary at Dundee But comparatively re 
cently mainly owing to the influence of the medical graduates 
of the University who are scattered throughout England and 
Ireland and form a majority of its general council arrange 
ments have been made for providing teaching of the subjects 
usually taken during the first two years of medical study and 
these have been in force during the last four years The late 
Marquis of Bute as Lord Rector of the University not only 
made generous contributions to the building funds of the 
University in respect of its medical faculty but he also made 
the munificent offer of 20000 to found a chair of anatomy 
provided the arrangements for two complete years of medical 
study were made permanent This as has been recorded in 
the British Medical Journal has become an accomplished

fact although in the opinion of some it was unwise to have a 
second years medical course where provision for hospital 
teaching was not available The plan of teaching anatomy 
and physiology with other ancillary sciences in a university 
with the understanding that the clinical training of the medi 
cal student should be obtained elsewhere has been followed 
with not other than good results in the case of the older 
English universities and the University of St Andrews has 
doubtless done wisely in accepting the late Lord Butes offer

LITERARY NOTES 
One of the signs of the times is the increasing attention 
everywhere given to tropical medicine There is nothing 
surprising therefore in the appearance of a journal devoted 
to the subject at Havana The title of the new periodical 
which is to be published monthly is Revista de Medicina 
Tropical The editorinchief is Professor Juan Gaiteras 
whose name is well known as an authority on tropical diseases 
and among the members of the staff are Dr Charlor Fini ay 
Dr Raimundo Menocal and Dr Emilio Martinez The firat 
number July contains papers on the introduction and dis 
semination of bubonic plague preventive inoculation against 
typhoid fever and the pathogeny of icterus gravis Among 
the contents of the second number August is a preliminary 
note by Professor Guiteras on  
Anopheles in Cuba 
In the July number of Science Gossip there will be found an 
interesting article by Major B M Skinner RAMC Medical 
Officer in charge of the Staff of the Sixth Division of the 
South Africa Field Force It is upon the geology of the region 
traversed by the army in the march from Enslin to Bloem 
fontein Major Skinner who is a skilled geologist describes  
the extraordinary appearance and formation of that inhospit 
able country The article is illustrated by diagrams of 
sections 
Mr Jonathan Hutchinson in a recent issue of his Archives 
of Surgery states that in the Harleian Manuscript 383 there is a 
copy of a letter from a Mr William Neve to Sir Thomas Hol 
lande concerning the embalmment and bringing to town of 
the body of King James The writer says  
The Kings body was about the 20th of March disembowelled and his 
heart was round to be great but soft his liver freshe as a young mans one 
of his kidneys very good but the other shrunke soe little as they could 
hardly find it wherein there was two stones His Lites and Gall blacke  
judged to proceed of melancholy The se my ture of his head so stronge as 
they could hardly breake it open with a chesill and a sawe  and soe full 
of braynes as they could not upon theopeninge keepe them from spilling  
a great marke of his infynite judgement 
Dr Max von Niessen Wiesbaden has issued the first num 
ber of a periodical to be devoted to the study of syphilis It is

man title is Beitrge zur SyphilisForschung  the French title 
Articles pour VInvestigation de la Syphilis The first number
