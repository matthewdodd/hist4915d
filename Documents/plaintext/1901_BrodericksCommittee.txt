I have heard of one medical man who is said to vaccinate 
and give the certificate at the same timeinspection is a de 
tail not worth troubling about And yet it has been seriously 
proposed to make every practitioner a public vaccinator and 
pay him from the public purse  With the better class of 
general practitioner I have much sympathy His welltodo 
intelligent patients accept the offer we are in duty bound to 
make them whereas the lower class say 
 
If we get it done at 
all we shall pay a shilling and have it properly done 
I am happy to say the lymph issued by the Local Govern 
ment Board now gives uniformly successful results both in 
primary vaccination and in revaccination Of course all 
results are carefully and accurately recorded by the public 
vaccinators and registers are available for reference at any 
time The vague word successful sums up the information 
obtainable about most private cases 
Finally with regard to the muchabused Public Vaccinators 
Association I think it would be much better for all public 
vaccinators to join it and make it what it should bea repre 
sentative bodyrather than to encourage still further the 
policy so dear to the profession in most mattersdisunion

INERT LYMPH AND RE VACCINATION 
SirThere have been communications more than enough 
lately published in the British Medical Journal to afford 
prima facie evidence that i the conditions under which vac 
cination 
lymph is issued are highly unsatisfactory and 2 a 
large proportion of the lymph which is on the market is 
more or less unreliable Meanwhile the epidemic of small 
pox is progressing and in the opinion of the Metropolitan 
Asylums Board has still a long course to run 
Of writing letters there is no end and very little good and 
it is time that more definite steps were taken to remedy the 
ill It is possible that an influential deputation to the Local 
Government Board might have some effect and perhaps it 
may not be too much to ask the Council of the British Medi 
cal Association as representative of medical opinion tobe 
publicspirited enough to take the matter in hand A com 
mittee might be formed to invite reports from public vac 
cinators and others and afterwards if necessary to under 
take or invite the Local Government Board to undertake an 
investigation as to the best method of preparation the im 
purities and standardisation of lymph and the control of its 
issue by central or local authoritiesI am etc

SirIn spite of Professor Moores reassuring letter in the 
British Medical Journal of November 30th my preference 
for the lymph supplied to me 
by 
an independent establish 
ment whose name I have but did not mention for obvious 
reasons was I think fully justified by the superior results it 
yielded when compared with those following the use of the 
lymph sent from Aldershot 
Whatever the cause of the inefficiency of the latter it was 
certainly inert when it reached my hands  whereas the 
lymph obtained from the 
independent 
source was active as I clearly 
showed in the case of three children mentioned in my letter 
in the Journal of November oth So far from misleading the 
public my letter corroborated Dr VerdonRoes experience of 
the use of an inefficient lymph 
Professor Moore states that no complaints were made as to 
my failures there I wish to make a correction Not only 
were complaints made to the Vaccine Institute at Aldershot 
but also to the DirectorGeneral RAMC and to the 
Principal Medical Officer Home District on several occasions 
Copies of these letters I now have with me The only 
encouragement received by way of reply was to the effect that 
as such good results had always been obtained from the 
Aldershot Vaccine Institute I had either failed in my duties 
or was making a frivolous complaint  At the time I heard on 
good authoritythe then acting PMO Home Districtthat 
mine were not the only failures 
In addition to the causes of the inefficiency of vaccine 
lymph mentioned by Professor Moore based presumably on 
his own observations I would suggest two etherscleansing 
of the arm preparatory to vaccination with too powerful an 
antiseptic and high dilution of the lymph with glycerineI

THE REPORT OF MR BRODRICKS COMMITTEE 
SirIt was with great pleasure that all wellwishers of the 
Royal Army Medical Corps read SurgeonGeneral Hamiltons 
letter in the British Medical Journal of November 23rd 
Amongst all the anonymous criticism of the Army Medical 
reorganisation scheme that has appeared this letter with 
those of 
 
An Officer of Long Indian Experience published 
on October 12th and of Dr Edward Thompson MP stands 
conspicuous as showing a sincere impersonal and dis 
criminating zeal for the welfare of the service With the 
other letters written for the most part by officers on the 
active list who naturally fear radical changes that may affect 
their whole future prospects 
one has also the greatest 
sympathy  and it is in the hope of easing to some extent the 
minds of their writers that I venture in an independent 
capacity to take up a few of the points raised in the three 
letters which have more especially focussed the criticism of 
the scheme 
SurgeonGeneral Hamilton admitting that 
 
this new 
scheme has good and liberal points lays chief stress on four 
features which he finds objectionable  
 
 The keeping at home of all the junior officers till they 
complete 
four years service This as he justly remarks 
would be fatal to the efficiency and credit of the scheme  but 
it is nowhere laid down and indeed was not even contem 
plated The Committee intended that lieutenants on leaving 
Aldershot should at once proceed to India and should there 
after three years service undergo the first examination for 
promotion 
b Theright to retire on 1 a day after twenty years 
service is taken away This would indeed be a grave in 
justice to officers of the corps and would produce the direst 
results But it was not intended by the Committee The 
mistake arises from a chance difference in the wording of the 
conditions which have always existed by which an unsatis 
factory officer may thus be retired without drawing further 
attention to his defects A major of my acquaintance in 
South Africa was thus retired after eighteen years service at 
an early period of the present war 
But it may be noted that even in the letter apart from the 
spirit of the scheme such a punishment is never to be in 
flicted on an officer unless he twice fails after three months 
studyleave to get a bare 40 per cent of marks in a simple 
examination on administrative subjects in which proficiency 
is as essential to the service as it must be natural to an 
RAMC officer with eighteen years experience  and even 
then only with the approval of the Advisory Board by whom 
the case will be considered entirely on its merits and on the 
further recommendation of the DirectorGeneral and the 
Secretary of State for War These are so many courts of 
appeal which will surely protect an officer from unjust treat 
ment Compulsory retirement at this stage will be as 
hitherto an active rather than a passive process 
c Examinations have their value but they are not 
everything that should be considered Quite so Examina 
tions test only the candidates knowledge the only thing that 
he can by his own initiative imnrove It is hoped in this 
scheme to secure a real practical and clinical 
 
standard of 
examination to test knowledge of the right kind The 
examinations will enable men who do their best to 
keep 
abreast of the times to get some reward in return for their 
labours as hitherto they have never had and it will be 
agreed that no officer who is unable after six months special 
preparation to get an allround mark of 50 per cent is worthy 
of his commission On the other hand as SurgeonGeneral 
Hamilton puts it tact temper zeal and a host of other 
virtues are of far greater importance But as these cannot be 
tested by any exact comparative system the scheme provides 
1 for brevet promotion and 2 for chargepay in command 
of hospitals appointment to which will be made by the 
DirectorGeneral doubtless with regard to fitness apart from 
examination 
d 
 The inspection of military hospitals by the Advisory 
Board will be unworkable and most unpopular I venture to

contest both points The Board is to inspect as far as 
is practicable 
 
and presumably will do most of its home in 
spections by a few short tours  it is not unlikely that it will 
depute proxies 
to inspect abroad from time to time These 
inspections it will be noticed are of an advisory and scientific 
not of a disciplinary character  for the DirectorGeneral is 
responsible 
for all discipline Section 18 Officers in charge 
will be only too glad of an opportunity of pointing out their 
needs The Inspecting Subcommittee will be the scientific 
eyes 
and ears of the DirectorGeneral Well must Surgeon 
General Hamilton be aware of the great gulf that has hitherto 
been fixed between 18 Victoria Street and the personnel of 
threequarters of the corps 
e A further criticismthat the position of the Director 
General is underminednow falls to the ground with his new 
position as LieutenantGeneral on the Army Board By 
virtue of this position many minor points may secure atten 
tion as they arise  and by the help of the Advisory Board the 
corps will be in touch with the medical profession in general 
and will have its weighty support 
I think these are the chief objections that have been raised 
to the scheme It is admittedly only a framework on which 
the Advisory Board will start work But the Royal Warrant 
will undoubtedly be based on the spirit rather than the letter 
of the scheme  it will take into consideration the points that 
have been raised in this discussion  it will pin down the 
Indian Government to their share of the bargain  and as the 
objections have been mostly in keeping with the spirit of the 
Committeethat of justice progress and reformI feel con 
fident that there is a good prospect in store for the RAMC

December 4th FRANCIS E FremANTLE 
SirI think you have hit the nail on the head when you 
state that  
the most important function of the Army Medical 
Service not only in peace but in war is the prevention of 
disease among troops Your strictures re the constitution 
of the civilian part of the 
Advisory 
Board will  am sure be 
emphatically endorsed by the majority of civilian surgeons 
who have had the honour of serving their Queen or King 
and country in South Africa The dominating idea which 
prevailed at the beginning of the Britain v Boer war as 
regards the necessity of having a number of experts in 
abdominal surgery has been shown by experience to be based 
entirely upon theoretical grounds sound in civil life and not 
upon the actual conditions which exist after engagements 
In the vast majority of gunshot wounds that require lapar 
otomy after a battle the psychological moment for operating 
had passed before the arrival of the surgeon and the 
safety of the patient was best considered by adopting a con 
servative course 
It is to be hoped that the Advisory Board will be augmented 
by 
men who have special knowledge and strong determined 
views regarding the prevention of disease among troops I 
am one of those who believe that if Dr Canneys ideas about 
the water supply of the army could be carried out more lives 
would be saved than would be if the whole craft of lapar otomists and dermatologists were to follow in the wake of an 
advancing army 
I may perhaps be allowed to relate the experience of the 
Welsh 
Hospital 
staff as regards enteric fever The water for 
the use of the staff was boiled and filtered The orderlies did 
not take the trouble to draw water from the filters for their 
own use and five out of the seven we took up country with us 
were down with enteric within a month Not one of the 
qualified staff dressers and sisters who eschewed unboiled  
water contracted enteric during the existence of the hospital 
Seven of the nursing sisters stayed out in South Africa after 
the hospital was handed over to the authorities and it is a 
significant fact that three of them afterwards contracted 
enteric fever I am not in a 
position 
to state whether their 
drinking water was conscientiously boiled Or not after we 
left There is no doubt in my mind that if eminent sanitary 
medical officers were appointed with welldefined executive 
powers 
an immense reduction in the mortality list would be 
the immediate result Prevention much more than the 
treatment of wounds or skin disease is the most urgent 
problem in every campaign but so far one cannot but feel 
that until the civilian element of the Advisory Board is 
radically altered their opinion with regard to this im 
portant matter will not command the confidence of the medi 
cal professionI am etc

SirAs the accuracy of my statement placing the pay and 
advantages of a surgeongeneral at home as high as 
1480 a year has been questioned will you kindly permit me 
to give trie following figures as supplied to me from an 
official source  
 s d 
Daily pay     2 15 o 
Lodging allowance    o n o 
Stable      o 1 9 
Servants     o 2 o 
Fuel and light     o 2 9 
Forage      o 4 3 
Total daily   x6 9 
This multiplied by 365 equals 1400 13s g Each sur 
geongeneral is allowed two soldier grooms to whom he pays 
about 1 a month each or say 24 a year Civilian grooms 
cost at least 1 is a week each which amounts to 
104 guineas or 109 4s a year  deducting the 24 paid to the 
soldier grooms leaves a net balance of 85 4s to credit which 
added to 1400 13s g makes a total of 1485 17s g per 
annum The proposed pay of a surgeongeneral is 1500 a 
year from the whole of which income tax has to be deducted 
and this leaves the surgeongenerals 15 17s d a year to the 
bad  but as in the summer months there is a small reduction 
in thefuel and light allowance I showed the loss to be about 
ioa year for the new over the old rates 
As regards the rates of pay in India the following table 
gives the new rates of home pay converted into rupees at 1 s 4d 1 
Home India 
Lieutenant under 3 years  Rs404  Under 5 years  Rs350 
Captain over 3 years  474   10    450 
  7    500 Over 10    500 
  10    597    500 
by which it will be seen that lieutenants and captains will 
draw less pay in that country than at heme Majors and 
junior lieutenantcolonels are fairly well paid but the 50 
senior selected lieutenantcolonels of whom 17 are on the 
Indian Establishment will draw but Rs 1150 against Rs 1450 
the pay of all infantry lieutenantcolonelsI am etc

THE LONDON UNIVERSITY AND CONJOINT 
STUDENTS 
SirI beg to suggest that now is a most favourable oppor 
tunity for the London University and the Royal Colleges to 
formulate some scheme for the institution of a pass degree in 
I medicine for London students 
The situation is 
pressing 
I submit that most future 
medical students will demand at least a pass degree as a 
reward for their labours If this is not forthcoming they will 
not be induced to come to London 
Generation after generation of medical students have 
hoped that something would be done by way of relief 
Longdeferred hope is at present in a 
dying 
condition 
and approaching the end and will be buried in the near 
future  hence the falling off in the entries at the metropolitan 
schools 
I As a result London will cease to be the great medical 
teaching centre and the Royal Colleges will lose their position 
as a pass diplomagranting body within say th next 15 
years 
The plea that London has great clinical advantages will no 
longer lure the student to London as provincial universities 
with wellequipped laboratories and able staffs of teachers 
have been formed in populous manufacturing districts which 
offer clinical material to satisfy the most enthusiastic teacher 
and studentI am etc 
Wimpole St w Dec 8th Frederick W Colltngwood 
SirI am sure the great majority of London Conjoint men 
will thoroughly endorse the letter by 
 
LRCP 
 
upon the 
question of a degree for London diplomates 
One cannot too strongly emphasise the fact that should the 
conditions of obtaining the MDDurh for practitioners be 
I withdrawn our last chance will go with it if we except the
