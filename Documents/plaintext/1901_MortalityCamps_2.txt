casionally occurunder what system will they notbut to 
base our legislation upon them is proverbially bad and a 
really illused midwife would be borne up by a tide of sym 
pathy and indignation which few men would care to face 
The financial aspect is the crux of this scheme as of most 
schemes and it too has been strangely slurred over in the 
proposed legislation Who is to pay the doctor Where the 
midwife was working for any public body or charitable com 
mittee there would of course be no difficulty  nor in the case 
f the few welltodo patients who might prefer her services  
but in the case of the very poor class who now resort to her 
in manufacturing towns or agricultural villages Boards of 
Ouardians must be empowered to pay a moderate but suffi 
cient fee in cases where the medical mans services were re 
quired reserving to themselves the right subsequently to 
recover it from the husband if his means should seem suffi 
cient I believe there is precedent for some such procedure 
and Parliament could probably be induced to sanction it 
The attitude of the profession generally towards all the 
legislation which has been proposed seems to be one of pas 
sive resistance and even its own parents are not enthusiastic 
over the Bill of the Parliamentary Bills Committee Is it too 
late in this longdrawn agitation for the mass of moderate 
men to unite upon some such scheme as I have sketched and 
actively oppose anything less I am etc

SirIn all the correspondence upon this topic I have 
seen no reference to the archaic history of registration It 
may interest your readers and some of your correspondents to 
know the following which is given me by the learned and 
Venerable Archdeacon of Montgomery who besides being a 
Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries is highly gifted both in 
reading and in observation 
From Phillimores Ecclesiastical Law page 2059 it appears that down to the passing of the Medical Act in 1858 bishops 
licensed physicians surgeons and midwives This was done 
partly in the interests of the Faculty to put a stop to 
impostors and charmers and especially for spiritual good 
The oath of midwives was very strict including  
ItemYou shall not in any wise use or exercise any manner of witch 
craft charm or sorcery invocation or other prayers than may stand 
with Gods laws and the Kings 
ItemYou shall not give any counsel or minister any herb medicine or 
potion or any other thing to any woman being with child whereby she 
should destroy or cast out that she goeth withal before her time 
ItemYou shall not consent agree give or keep counsel that any 
woman be delivered secretly of that which she goeth with but in the 
presence of two or three lights ready 
With other regulations as to conduct 
The Archdeacon gives me some notes of physicians and 
surgeons in this St Asaph diocese so licensed for example  
1665 Practicers of PhysickNone licensed or resident in the diocese  but 
one 
Dr Turner Thomas administers at Llanrwst 
Dr John Mostyn administers at Wrexham  
Vaughan frequently at Denbigh 
All three Papists 
and 
1756 At Abergeley licence for Surgery granted to Edward Griffith 
Gent by Robt Wynne DD Vicargeneral and official Principal of Isaac 
 Bishop of St Asaph 
Unfortunately at the time of writing no reference could be 
found of any midwife so licensed  but the Archdeacon has 
such a note somewhere 
The Medical Act of 1858 makes no mention of repealing any 
former Act Consequently it is a fair inference that the law 
under which such licencesand accordingly registrations 
were effected is still extantI am etc

THE MORTALITY IN THE BOER CONCENTRATION 
CAMPS 
SirThe mortality of the children in the concentration 
camps in South Africa is large and appalling But I desire 
to point out that the method of estimation used in the article 
on the subject in the British Medical Journal of November 
9th 
and which is generally employed in the press is very 
inaccurate It is not correct to estimate a yearly mortality by 
imply multiplying a monthly or weekly rate unless you 
i have evidence that the population remains stationary in 
namber8r that ism1iheprsent eafce unless the loss by death 
is compensated by gain from births and new arrivalsk As we 
do not know that this is so it would be safer if we want to 
estimate the effect of a constant rate of mortality for a year 
to treat it as operating on a diminishing populationthat is 
one which decreases each month by the number of deaths in 
such period A different result then comes out Thus the 
figures which you have given for the four months June to 
September show a monthly mortality of 267 per iooo chil 
dien or 1 in 37 as stated This would tell up not to 12 times 
267 but to 2784 per 1000 in the year The statement that if 
the present conditions prevailed for three years all the Boer 
children now in the camps would be annihilated hardly needs 
refuting A population would never be wholly destroyed by 
a mortality of the highest rate imaginable unless it reached 
the integer since it operates necessarily on a constantly 
diminishing number As a fact it can easily be shown that 
if 1000 children are taken the mortalityrate in question 
would destroy not the whole 1000 but 623 of them in the 
course of three years 
I think however that considering the uncertainty of the 
numbers in the camps from one month to another and the 
influence of temporary epidemic or endemic causes it would 
be better to confine ourselves to the statement of a monthly 
rate of mortality which can be compared with the English or 
any other standard reduced from a yearly to a monthly rate 
for this purpose Where the rate is small as with us its 
multiplication or reduction to correspond with differing 
eriods 
of time is attended with little error The error is 
arge in the case of high rates such as those prevailing in the 
camps 
May I add that the deathrate of women which is in the 
camps so excessive is normally somewhat lower than that of 
men during the greater part of life but not 
 
much lower as 
stated  
I write thus in the plea for statistical accuracy not at all 
to detract from the purpose of your article which justly 
emphasises the terrible character of the loss now going on 
and the need for radical sanitary measures Probably we 
are far from the end of the troubles in this respect The 
breaking out of scurvy is to be looked for if the conditions are 
not greatly changedI am etc 
Finsbury Square EC Nov 11th R HlNGSTON Fox 
 The contributor of the article on the concentration 
camps writes  
If Dr Hingston Foxs contention that annual deathrates 
based on weekly deaths cannot be correctly estimated holds 
good the weekly returns issued by the RegistrarGeneral 
stand condemned In truth however if it be remembered 
that they indicate a deathrate based on the facts of a given 
week they are not misleading Much less likely to mislead 
are deathrates based like those in the special article on the 
mortality statistics for four months This is a much larger 
slice of a year than a week and much more likely to repre 
sent the average experience of a year For the benefit how 
ever of those holding Dr Foxs views monthly deathrates 
were given which are statistically quite free from possible 
objection Dr Foxs contention that a decreasing population 
must be assumed is contradicted by the facts for the largest 
camps and therefore Dr Foxs alternative statement of 
deathrates is erroneous Dr Fox is right in his criticism of 
the statement that an annual deathrate among children of 
1 in 3 would cause annihilation in about three years This 
does not however destroy the significance of the facts that 
1 out of 37 children died during a month that during four 
months 1 out of 9 children died and that if this deathrate be 
continued for a year 1 out of every 3 will have died It 
should further be noted that the statement of proportion be 
tween English and concentration camp deathrate s among 
children as 31 to 180 which is sufficiently appalling does 
not allow for the fact that this assumes that all the children 
in the camps are less than 5 years old Wtre the correct ages 
given the excess of mortality among the children in the 
camps would be seen to be even more excessive than I 
have shown it to be Whether the dirty and insanitary 
habits of the Boers and especially of the Boer women be 
partially responsible for this or whether it be the civil or 
military authorities there is
