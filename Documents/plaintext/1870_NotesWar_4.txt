NOTES OF THE WAR 
DR GEORGE KORN private teacher in the University of Breslau was 
killed at Metz on August 18th 
SOME of the wounded at Reichshoffen have arrived at the military 
hospital of Versailles and more are expectcd The ordinary patients 
of the hospital have been sent to Alen9on and other places 
LISTS of the wounided on both sides have hitherto been exchanged 
between the German and French Aid Committees by way of Geneva 
An arrangement however has been decided on by which the transmis 
sion will be direct 
THE 7ounzal des Conaissances Akldicales Pratiyttes says that in future 
whenever time allows the wounded will be transported on straw in 
open luggagewagons instead of as hitherto being shut up in closed compartments 
THE medical department of the Prussian Mlinistry says the Wietner 
Afedizin IVochenschrift has sent a large supply of disinfectants as well 
as of medicines to the districts around Mfetz It is intended when AMetz 
has surrendlered to send away to distant healthy places the sick and 
wounded who are shut up there after disinfection has been applied 
The Prussian medical department has also sent to the army a supply of 
medicines for diarrhcea which usually prevails at this season of the year 
The state of the health of the German troops in France continues to be very favourable 
TIIE JOIHANNIITER CORPS 
A SPECIAL correspondent of the Daily Teecgqph passes some severe 
strictures on the J ohanniter Corps which tally in every respect with reports 
which have come to us from other quarters and they are the opinions of 
the German people themselves  lhis corps is composedl of gentlemen 
many of whom have served in the army but the greater number of 
them are civilians who have undergone their three years regulation 
service In order to qualify a gentleman to become a jolhanniter he must 
be able to show fourteen quarters upon his coat of arms and an un 
blemished descent of many years he is then entitled to wear a white 
enamelled 1Maltese cross suspended by a green ribbon to his neck and 
an uniform of the same description as the Prussian infantry except that 
the buttons have a Maltese cross upon them and the white badge with 
the red cross is worn upon the left arm Under their care for the purpose of distribution are placed all the medical comfortswine pro visions and beddingthat are sent by individuals or communities for 
the use of the sick and wounded  and without a special order from them 
none of these things can be taken even by medical men Now I am not 
goig to say that all are alike but the conduct ofthese gentlemen for the 
most part is beneath contempt They live upon the fat of the land 
they never know what it is to want a meal and they take care it is a good one The medical staff are continually at logerheads with them 
because they cannot get what has been sent out for the special benefit 
of the sick and wounded soldiers They are always m the best quar 
ters and never where they are nted There are however soine noble exceptions 
THE GENEVA CONVENTION 
COMPLAINTS of infraction of the Geneva Convention are says the 
Wienter AMedizin Wovhenchkrsft made by both the belligerent armies 
The Prussians and the French accuse each other of firing on the dress 
ingstations and fieldhospitals and of treating the surgeons and their 
helpers as combatants Such complaints will be constantly heard for 
notwithstanding the best intentions of rulers and commanders in the 
field excesses of this kind are not to be restrained in the heat of battle 
The paragraphs of the Geneva Convention may be unknown to many 
officers and most subalterns of both armiesnay they may be ignornt 
of the Convention itself to say nothing of the natural savageness of a 
heated and raging soldiery In spite of all the blessings of the Con 
vention have come to light in many points in this terrible contest and 
having been so far recognised it will certainly attain its proper value 
LOAFERS UNDER THE RED CROSS 
A CORRESPONDENT at Berlin writes that communications received from 
the theatre of war complain of the great crowd following the army under 
the sign of the Geneva cross only a minority of them are able and 
willing really to help the rest coming for curiosity and using the shelter 
and food intended for the sufferers The soldiers have nicknamed such 
persons  battleloafers The Royal German Commissary for volun 
tary aid has up to this day distributed cards for more than 12000 
persons it is evident that among this number there may be many unfit 
for the purpose because in the short space of time a careful selection 
and examination of the competitors was not possible The voluntary aid 
might perhaps be still more closely connected with and subordinated to the military medical service Similar complaints couched in the warmest 
terms are made by other correspondents at the seat of war They are 
in many cases not without truth and one of our special correspondents says that several persons happily not English wearing the Geneva 
badge have been found robbing the dead and wounded 
THE WAR HOSPITALS 
THE following notes have been sent us by Dr J Ford Anderson who 
has recently returned from a tour through some of the hospitals in the 
rear of the German armies 
At AixlaChapelle I first saw the wounded There the existing 
hospitals being insufficient to accommodate the wounded a large 
wooden hospital on the pavilion system was in course of erection 
One wing was completed and its sixty beds were occupied with patients 
suffering from wounds of every part of the body There was a case of 
perforation of the windpipe and pharynx The patient declined the use of the stomachpump and he was supported by nourishing enemata 
In another case a single ball had perforated both thighs and the external 
genitals In a third case the ball entering the external ear had passed 
out through the antrum cruslhing in its course forward the temporal 
and malar bones Most of the wounds however were in the extremities 
and in many of these cases there was fracture of the bone The patients 
were all Prussians anid their wounds were caused by the chassepot 
Througlh the kindness of Dr Brandis I was enabled to see and assist 
in the treatment of these cases during my short stay The treatment of 
wounds was by irrigation with a weak solution of Condys fluid followed 
by a dressing of charpie dipped in carbolised oil and covered with imper 
meable paper This was done twice daily In cases of fracture the 
limb was enveloped in plaster of Paris The mode of application was 
as follows The limb was first bandaged with pressed cottonwool four 
laths were then laid lengthways along the limb and the whole was 
bound down with a bandage which was smeared thickly with plaster of 
Paris The apertures of entrance and exit were left exposed for the 
purpose of irrigation and for removing portions of bone which were 
loose The surgery was decidedly conservative Several cases of frac 
ture in joints were intended for resection At that time three weeks 
ago Dr Brandis had amputated in one case only 
As the hospital at AixlaChapelle was not likely to be ready for a 
fortnight and there was a sufficient number of assistants to do the work 
there I resolved to go nearer the seat of war On my way through 
Coblentz and Saarbriick I visited the larger lazarettes Everywhere I 


318 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURNAL Sept 171870 
found the same conservatism in surgery Resections of the elbow 
shoulder and knee will be numerous for some weeks to come On the 
day I visited Saarbriick three of these resections were performed in 
the tent of the Amsterdam Aid Society I did not find the irrigation 
treatment of wounds so uiual as I went on Instead of it baths of sheet 
zinc filled with water were used and in these the wounded limbs were 
immersed This treatment is less troublesome but appears to make 
the granulations soft and flabby From Saarbriick I went into France 
travelling by that slowest of conveyances a militairzug At last how 
ever I reached Kemilly and Courcelles in time to aid in the dressing 
and preparation for transport of four or five hundred of the soldiers 
wounded in the battle at Metz on August 3Ist The wounded were 
brought down to these stations and laid on straw in sheds All of them 
had been attended to in some way on the field but here their cases were 
revised Bad cases are treated in the local hospitals until they can 
bear being transported to Germany I was much struck with the de 
sire of the wounded soldiers to be considered by the doctor able to 
travel homewards The German love for the Fatherland is intense 
and I saw many a strong man stealthily dash the tears from his eyes 
when his sentence  Hier bleiben was pronounced And when it is 
possible the surgeon who has to decide whether the wounded man shall 
go or stay respects his feelings Apart from sentiment the disappoint 
ment of remaining and consequent depression must often have a retard 
ing effect on the recovery 
Much of the dressing of wounds is done by nonprofessional volun 
teer helpers of the different Aid Societies German and foreign I have 
heard of sixty of these societies and probably there are more Their 
object is to assist in every way the sick and wounded They carry them 
off the field of battle They give them stores with which they are en 
trusted They dress their lighter wounds and call a surgeon for the 
severer wounds and so on Many of them are educated men who 
leave their professions to do this work The usefulness of these assist 
ants individually cannot be overestimated But as each society acts in 
dependently it often happens that helpers are in excess in one place 
while another place is shorthanded Many of the societies live in camp 
at their own expense and provide comforts for the wounded and ask 
for nothing but information as to where their services are required but 
this they can with difficulty obtain There is a general disposition to 
blame as obstructive to their usefulness the Knights of St John 
johanniter This order is composed of men of good social posi 
tion and ample means and theoretically they are supposed to look after 
the wounded but the humbler workers complain that these gentlemen 
confine themselves to the light duties of verbal comfort and the distri 
bution of small delicacies and rather discourage than assist others in 
doing the hard work which I have indicated However it arises the 
fact remains that much labour and philanthropy is wasted and much 
suffering is unrelieved from want of a proper organising head Two 
examples occur to me A well educated member of the Hamburgh 
Krankenpflegers told me that after the battle of the 3Ist August at 
Metz the detachments of his Society went on the field to remove the 
wounded Having worked till nightfall when complete exhaustion com 
pelled them to desist from their labour they rested for a few hours 
leaving many wounded on the field who were still alive At dawn it 
was found that all of these had died during the night and who can say 
they would not have recovered with proper attention And yet hun 
dreds of able volunteerslonging for workmight have been collected 
in a few hours from towns and villages where their services were no longer 
urgently required Again from want of organisation it often happens 
that the wounded despatched homewards travel for four and five days 
without having their wounds dressed Yet imperfect as is the action of 
isolated societies they have better means of knowing where help is 
needed than individuals therefore I would recommend any surgeon 
going abroad to attach himself to some society and to go where it sends 
him anid none is better than our National Aid Society 
Of course my personal observation does not amount to much but 
I may say that I did not see or hear of a bayonetwound or a 
sabrecut 
Another correspondent writing from St Marie aux Chenes on August 
22nd provides the following notes 
Although I left London on the 15th I am still far from my destina 
tionheadquarters Travelling is indeed slow and wearisome The 
endless trains of wounded one meets with testify to the cost which 
Prussia has paid for her unexpected successes I passed through Saar 
briicken and Herny Falquemont and Remilly and everywhere the 
houses and hospitals were crowded to overflowing These of course 
represented the least severe casesmostly fleshwounds  though among 
them were many who were in a poor condition to undertake a long 
tiresome journey It was however absolutely necessary to transport 
them somewhere and the men were equally anxious to go home to their 
friends 
It was in Remilly that I first saw anything serious I chanced to have 
quarters allotted to me in the Chateau Rolland which had been fitted 
up as a lazarette and was really very comfortable but very short of sur 
gical appliances There was a poor fellow who had been shot in the 
head The ball had struck him about the juncture of the parietal and 
occipital bones behind and had made a complete furrow tearing away 
scalp and bone and brain altogether He was of course in extremis 
The Chassepot bullets make a very cleancut wound The calibre of 
the bullet is very small and being conical I suppose it cuts more 
freely and with less laceration of the surrounding soft parts especially 
near its exit The exit in many cases is as small as the entrance hole 
and it is often difficult to distinguish them The balls sometimes make 
strange circuits One patient was struck in the middle of the calf of 
the leg and the bullet passed upwards and forwards splintered the 
femur just above the kneejoint and came out on the upper and outer 
surface of the thigh 
I only stayed one night at Remilly I had to hurry on to St Marie 
auxChenes where they had been fighting very hard for two or three 
days We passed through several villages on our wayGorse St 
Privat and others It was three days after the fighting and it was 
said officially that there were upwards of 70ooo dead and wounded 
I could well imagine that to be true for they were lying even on the road 
sides every house and stable and church and barn being crammed to 
overflowing and from the fields around for two or three miles there 
arose such a stench as must be smelt in order to be appreciated In 
St Marie whence I write there is a very large number of wounded  
and it is more especially of these that I can speak as a section was 
kindly handed over to me In a barn there were twentysix men of 
these two had bullets through the lungs one in front one behind three 
had compound fracture of the femur two had bullets in the knee either 
in or near the joint one had a severe headwound and the remainder 
were cases of simple shotwounds This is a large proportion of serious 
cases and I believe I speak truly when I say that in other houses and 
places the proportion is equally great 
There were no primary amputations under treatment The medical 
staff and appliances were so utterly inadequate to the demand that for the 
first five or six days nothing was done but arrange the men and get them 
under cover On the 22nd today a few operations were performed 
amputationsthe circular method being chosen in each case The sur 
geons seem unwilling to operate much thinking it too late I expect 
that in either case the mortality will be exceedingly great as the greater 
number of the cases now remaining are of a very serious nature My 
stay here will be much too short to give any detailed account either of 
the results or of the operations which may ultimately be performed To 
make matters worse there is a great want of water The great demand 
made on the wells and thedryweathertogethersomewhat account for this 
Cold applications seemed to be the most agreeable  but water could 
not be had not even enough for drinking purposes There is a want 
of cleanliness The charpie and other dressing from the wounds now 
beginning to suppurate vigorously are simply hidden beneath the straw 
there to ferment and give rise to odours far from agreeable and such as 
will not in any way conduce to the wellbeing of the patients who can 
not get out of the way I believe that this was the cause of a rather 
severe kind of diarrhoea which troubled the poor fellows very much 
the more so as they were lying on straw and bedpans were not to be 
had Compound fractures of the leg are put up in plaster of Paris 
bandages with a window opposite the wound I am very curious to 
see the result of this treatment 
The same correspondent writing from PontaMousson on August 
26th says 
I have just returned from a visit to one of the fieldhospitals and 
thanks to the kindness of StaffSurgeon Dr D E Muller I saw a good 
deal in a short time I happerned to reach the place just in time to see 
an excision of the light anklejoint The man had been shot through 
the joint obliquely from without inwards The extremity of the fibula 
was completely broken through and a portion of the lower end of the 
tibia was also gone It was eight days after the injury had been re 
ceived An incision had been made for the escape of some pus which had 
collected and it was through this opening that the real condition of the 
joint was ascertained A counteropening was made over the inner 
ankle through which a chainsaw was introduced The lower ends of 
the tibia and fibula were removed with the upper surface of the astra 
galus The foot was then put up in plaster of Paris 
The next case was ligature of the femoral artery The man had been 
shot through the calf of the leg and the posterior tibial artery was injured 
Bleeding had come on repeatedly in spite of styptics and ligatures and 


Sept 17 1870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURNAL 319 
so the artery was tied The man was simply put back to bed without 
further application of either wool or warmth of any kind to the limb 
I next saw exarticulation of the femur for a compound comminuted 
fracture of the thigh very high up The bullet could nfot be found 
The patient had been sent from some one of the villages in the 
neighbourhood of the battlefield he had been put up in a plaster of 
Paris bandage extending well round the hip and had certainly borne 
the journey fairly well 
These were the only operations which I saw performed We then 
went round the wards in which were some interesting cases There 
was a man on whom tracheotomy had been performed five days 
previously He had been wounded in the throat the ball had not 
passed through but there was very great cedema  and respiration was 
so difficult that tracheotomy was determined on He was doing very 
well and it was proposed to take out the tube on the following day I 
also saw three cases of excision of the elbowjoint They were being 
dressed much as we do them in England Instead of resting on cushions 
they were suspended and swung about easily according as the patient 
himself moved We then came to a man who had been shot in the 
upper part of the chest The clavicle had been considerably damaged 
It was feared the splinters might injure or cut the vein or artery and 
so nearly the whole clavicle had been extirpated The patient was 
doing well Dr Muller showed me also a case of excision of the 
shoulderjoint It had been done in consequence of a complicated in 
jury involving the whole joint He had performed several amputations 
both of the thigh and leg  but it was too soon to say much about them 
I endeavoured to find out whether there was much or any difference 
in the wound produced by the Chassepot and the Prussian bullet but 
could learn nothing The Prussian bullets I think are somewhat 
larger and are eggshaped and are perhaps just a little heavier 
The hospital had been extemporised out of a large French barrack 
The wards were large and airy and the patients seemed to be very 
comfortable 
I cannot speak too highly of Dr Mullers kindness and courtesy to 
me a perfect stranger who had to introduce himself as best he could 
I leave here tomorrow for Commercy 
TENTHOSPITALS 
THE following notes on tenthospitals are from a German physician of 
London who is at present in the neighbourhood of the Rhine 
The experiments which have been made in the war of I 866 and since 
to treat the wounded and sick in tents or in wooden houses have led 
to the adoption of this plan on a larger scale in the present war A 
tenthospital containing at present two hundred and forty beds is in 
full working order at Cologne The tents beds and bedding are the 
gift of the German Association in London in aid of the sick and 
wounded in the present war Twenty of the tents are already open 
and there is a supplement of fifteen which will either be used in the 
same place or forwarded to some other locality where they are more 
urgently needed The tents were furnished by Messrs Paget Piggot 
and Edgington and the bedding by Messrs Heal and Co in London 
Each tent contains ten beds but the superficial area being only sixteen 
by thirty feet it appeared to us that the beds were too near each other 
and that eight would be quite a sufficient number for each tent It is 
worthy of notice however that even in those tents that were quite full 
of patients with suppurating wounds the air was perfectly sweet This 
is no doubt in part also due to the excellent system of disinfection 
which is carried out and of which we shall have to say a few words 
hereafter At one end of the tent a portion about four feet wide is 
separated from the rest by a curtain drawn across and opening in the 
middle behind which on one side a table with different hospital 
appliances and on the other a MiillerSchiirs closet earthcloset with 
a disinfectant powder instead of the earth are placed Gas and water 
are laid on In every tent are suspended one or two of Professor 
Esmarchs irrigatorstin cans holding about two pints of water which 
flows out through an Indiarubber tube of sufficient length to be used 
for all the beds For each patient there is a separate nozzle of hard 
rubber and this is kept during the time between the dressings in a 
glass filled with Condys fluid These irrigators are simply used for 
syringing the wounds and Condys fluid is used for this purpose 
A most extensive use is made of carbolic acid dissolved either in 
water or in oil for dressing the wounds All articles of dressing 
which are not worth washing are burnt the others are kept for 
twelve hours in a disinfecting fluid containing chlorinated soda before 
washing them The tents are pitched in a beautiful garden and a con 
servatory has been fitted up as a washhouse whilst a washhouse and 
stable have been admirably transformed into a kitchen and larder The 
administration of the whole hospital is in the hands of the indefatigable 
Mr Deichmann of London The medical service is performed by 
several practitioners of Cologne of whom Dr Servais one of the lead 
ing men at Cologne is day and night on the premises besides two 
assistants The household department and the nursing are in the 
hands of several ladies belonging to the first families of the town 
Upon the whole nothing could make a better impression than the 
order and cleanliness of this hospital The diet is very liberal Every 
patient gets meat twice a day plenty of beeftea eggs and beer in 
fact the only limit seems to be his capacity for digesting If the mili 
tary world has been astonished at the complete change which Germany 
has undergone in military matters within the last few years the medical 
world may not be the less surprised at the complete overthrow of the 
notions which not long ago were prevailing in Germany as to diet 
dressing of wounds and ventilation Open windows are now the 
order of the day or the patients are kept under tents or they are car 
ried in their beds in the open air whenever the weather allows it 
Condys fluid carbolic acid and chloride of lime are used in all hos 
pitals extensively 
Three tents at Cologne are of a somewhat different shape from the 
English ones being somewhat wider They are the regulation tents 
of the Prussian Army Medical Service and were bought at Cologne 
It will be gratifying for the English makers to learn that their tents 
stood the drenching rains prevailing lately better than those made at 
Cologne although they also let a little rain pass through especially 
over the ventilator at the top the arrangement of which might be 
sonmewhat improved 
At Bonn there are altogether fifteen lhospitals for the wounded and 
several magnificent villasamong others the house of Professor Busch 
have been fitted up for the reception of patients We saw many 
severe cases about a dozen where the arm had been amputated 
several amputations of the thigh one case of resection of the humerus 
and several of the elbowjoint Most of the patients were doing remark 
aby well all whom we saw were under the care of Dr von Mosengeil 
There were several curious cases of bullets having entered the pelvis 
and where symptoms on the part of the bladder or rectum had been 
present and in which there could hardly be a doubt of the peritoneum 
being wounded and yet the patients were doing well and no periton 
itis had set in The surgeons are under the impression that the wounds 
upon the whole heal more quickly in the French  but that the Ger 
mans bear pain better There is a good deal of dysentery among the 
wounded coming from the front 
A tenthospital similar to that at Cologne is about being established 
at Bingen The tents for two hundred and fifty to three hundred 
patients with all the furniture and bedding are also given by the 
German Association in London Dr Thudichum is at the head of 
the undertaking and Mr John Simon who is spending his holiday at 
Bingen is also taking a most active part in it and his cooperation will 
prove most valuable Eleven young English surgeons from different 
London hospitals are engaged to act as dressers and assistants We 
learn that the National Society in London bears the expenses of the 
latter and that this Society has also supplied instruments A site has 
already been found on the Rochneberg and we trust that before 
another week has passed white flags with the red cross will indicate the 
existence of this truly international hospital 
MEDICAL SYSTEM OF THE GERMAN ARMY DURING WAR 
THE following is from our Special Correspondent dated Berlihi Sep 
tember 7 1870 
In my last letter see JOURNAL Sept 3rd p 254 I gave a sketch of 
the organisation of the military medical service and I still have to com 
plete it in several points Part of the places are filled by the military 
surgeons whose number in peace is sufficient for all demands when the 
army is mobilised through the whole country the medical men as well as 
all other men of certain ages are bound to military service but in gene 
ral their number together with that of the military surgeons does not 
fully make up the full medical staff of the mobile army amounting to 
more than 3ooo The deficiency is made good as far as possible by 
medical volunteers taken partly from among the elder students Any 
vacancies that remain are in general among the troops the field 
hospitals the sanitary detachments and the hospital reserve of every 
army corps are made complete these bodies being destined for the first 
hospital treatment of the wounded On the average the proportion of 
the persoznzel among them is this one surgeon for thirtythree patients 
one Lazarethgehiilfe hospital helper for twentyfive and one nurse for 
thirteen patients In the whole army there is about one surgeon for 
each two hundred and fifty men 
The reserve hospitals are established either in garrison hospitals or in 
other buildings approved of by the provincial general surgeon Their 


320 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURAAL Sept I7 I870 
administration is under the military medical service Their medical 
staff is furnished from the surgeons of the town for one hundred 
patients there are an ordinary and two assistant surgeons Every 
patient ought to have at least I200 cubic feet of air 
A change in the military medical service first made in the war of 
i866 then worked so well that it has been renewed in the present war 
I mean the institution of consulting general surgeons They are 
nominated in case of war and are selected mostly from the professors 
of surgery they have to work in the dressing stations and in the field 
hospitals and may without having anything to do with the adminis 
fration devote themselves entirely to scientific work and advise the 
surgeons and the chiefs of the hospitals The present circumstances as 
well as the experience of i866 have proved the advantage of this insti 
tution not only to the wounded soldiers but also to the surgeons of the 
fieldhospitals which are made thus a most excellent school of surgery 
The present consulting surgeons areVon Langenbeck Wilms Barde 
leben Busch Roser Wegner Wagner Stromeyer and Esmarch As in 
all probability the present war will give occasion to epidemics Professor 
Frerichs has been made general consulting physician in order that 
there may be a scientific authority to watch and if possible to avoid 
the outbreak of contagious disease in the army The materials of 
medicine instruments and bandages in the sanitary detachments and 
the fieldhospitals are very complete In addition in case of need on 
the battlefield every soldier has according to a new regulation 
material for the first dressing sewed in his left pocket in order that it 
may be found easily namely a piece of old linen a linen bandage 
four yards long half an ounce of charpie and a piece of oiled linen 
Instead of the bandage Professor Esmarch proposes for the future 
I think not wrongly a triangular piece of linen as more fit for the 
various kinds of bandaging He thinks that by a woodcut printed on 
the cloth and representing these bandages the men might be enabled to 
bandage themselves in case of need  
To supply the fieldhospitals with stores in proportion to what has 
been used after a battle there are hospital reservedepots one of which 
belongs to every armycorps and follows it as closely as possible They 
are under the direction of the GeneralEtappenZinspection and are sup 
plied by this board from the large depots at home But however 
extensive the official arrangements may be the experience of these last 
years has taught that they always remain insufficient in a certain degree 
and for certain times particularly after great battles and that will 
happen especially in Germany where the army is a proportionally much 
larger part of the nation than anywhere else Already in i866 when 
the extension and usefulness of voluntary aid were for the first time put 
to a severe proof and where it had for the most part to be created an 
endeavour was made to centralise it in order to avoid confusion and 
waste The speedy end of the war stopped the full realisation of the 
plan but since in the reform of the military medical service every 
attention has been paid to voluntary aid The official chief royal com 
missary and military inspector of voluntary aid is nominated by the 
King at the beginning of the war in i866 Count Stolberg held the 
office in 1870 it is held by Prince Pless He is in communication with 
the various aid societies and with the waroffice by delegates chosen 
in a great part among the Knights of St John he is represented at 
different places in the country as well as in the fieldhospitals and on 
the theatre of war 
In general the special functions of the voluntary aid department are 
to collect the voluntary gifts and distribute them to the fieldhospitals 
and troops where they are wanted to establish and support reserve 
hospitals and if necessary to offer private quarters and to prepare 
male and female nurses for the hospitals and for the transport of the 
wounded Direct relief to the fighting troops is furnished as much as 
possible by the staff of the army and only exceptionally by the volun 
teers This restriction is evidently demanded by a regard to tactic 
operations which however does not prevent voluntary aid from coming 
into action after a battle and particularly after a victorious one Thus 
in the days after the great fights near Metz a great number of volunteers 
were exceedingly useful by their personal help and the materials which 
they brought with them Directions as to the places and hospitals 
where they are wanted are given to the voltunteers by the royal commis 
sary aind by his delegates Up to the 24th August 2702 persons were 
sent in this way by the royal commissary to the hospitals and battle 
fields They came from various parts of Germany and were of differ 
ent stations in life students clerks tradesmen etc most of them 
were under the guidance of medical men 
Private societies may assist hospitals by undertaking certain branclhes 
of the administration for instance the provision of food cooking 
nursing etc or by establishing newv hospitals Such hospitals are 
superintended as regards their hygiene by a military surgeon and 
they must be provided for at least twenty patients as otherwise mili 
tary control over the men would be impossible A further explanation 
of the aid societies I delay to my next letter preferring to give a short 
description of the large barrack hospital now established near Berlin on 
the field of Tempelhof Besides the other buildings there are fifty 
barracks each fitted for thirty patients the whole hospital containing 
I5oo beds One third of the expense of building it is borne by the 
military exchequer one third by the city of Berlin and one third by 
the Berlin Aid Society Each department has its own administration the 
dispensary and operating room alone being in common The barracks 
form a w or rather a A with the base from north to south Kitchens 
laundries administration and store rooms are situated between the open 
ends of the wings of the vs Each barrack is an oblong quadrangle 
with its long diameter from east to west forty paces long and ten paces 
broad At one end are four small rooms one for the bath one for the 
clothes a small kitchen and a room for the nurse at the other end 
outside the barrack but connected to it by the roof is the closet The 
ward itself has doors at the two opposite ends and ten windows on each 
side The building material in all the barracks is wood oiled on the 
inside The roofs are covered with fireproof pasteboard and have a 
ventilator the openings of which can be closed For the sake of 
experiment the various groups of barracks differ as to the height of 
their base above the ground the shape and construction of the venti 
lators the manner of preparing the floor in some the latter is covered 
with asphalte etc Some of the barracks are surrounded with galleries 
which can be closed by curtains  here the windows are not of glass 
but of wiregauze At first sight the greater obscurity of the interior 
seems to be a disadvantage Every building has gas and water the 
latter being given gratuitously by the liberality of the Berlin water 
works Rails are laid down within the barracks so as to bring the 
soldiers thither directly a telegraph communicates with the town At 
present the barrackhospitals are nearly finished and contain some 
hundred patients already It is to be hoped that the severity of the 
winiter may not put a too early end to the utilisation of this well con 
structed hospital 
THE WOUNDED IN BERLIN 
UNDER date September 4th our Special Correspondent writes as 
follows 
There are in Berlin and its suburbs at present twentyeight hospitals 
of different sizes with accommodation for 3700 sick and wounded 
soldiers a number which will be increased in a few days by goo with 
the completion of the barracks On September Ist 2503 of the beds 
were occupied by patients viz I960 Germans and 543 French A 
few days ago the number of the latter was much larger  but expecting 
a still larger number of patients the administration sent away all the 
slightly wounded who could be removed without damage Of severely 
wounded there are in Berlin at present 303 Prussians Ioo French  of 
slightly wounded 957 Prussians and 303 French Of the whole number 
of beds above named not quite half are furnished by the military ad 
ministration the rest by voluntary aid societies 
ARRANGENIENTS IN GERMANY FOR THE SICK AND WOUNDED IN WAR 
DR GEISSEk of Ems has furnished us with the following interesting in 
formation in continuation of his note published in the JOURNAL of 
September 3rd 
Voluntary AMedical DejartmentThere never has been a war in 
which the sanitary arrangements have been sufficient to meet all the 
wants of the sick and wounded Miss Nightingale has made her name 
immortal by laying the foundation to a system of private help and 
Durant taking up these ideas became the father of the Geneva Con 
vention the most noble creation of our century The white flag with 
the red cross covers the place where loving Christian hearts anid noble 
hands rivalise in selfsacrificing zeal to soothe the sufferings of sick and 
wounded whatever their name or nation may be The first condition 
of making voluntary help useful in war time consists in a thorough 
organisation anid submission to the military sainitary department The 
necessity of this was seen in i866 and it has been still more 
apparent in the present war Since i866 the Association for the 
Relief of the Sick and Wounded in War has spread all over Germany 
Both in large and in small towns societies have been formed for the 
purposes of collecting money educating nurses preparing hospital 
requisites etc All these small societies have joined the general 
association Each member pays an annual subscription of which one 
third is delivered to the central fund the remaining twothirds being used 
as each society considers best The associationi in war time acts in 
dependence on the military sanitary department The war had not 
been decl L ed many days when the central committee from Berlin sent 
their order o all the branch societies desiring them to provide what 


Sept 171870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 321 
was urgently wanted and the call was answered well and quickly 
Minute details had been given as to the kind size and form of every 
thing required in the shape of lint bandages etc Thousands of 
persons collected money blankets wine brandy preserves extract of 
meat etc Hospitals to contain from twenty to two hundred beds 
sprang up barracks were built a medical staff was prepared well 
trained nurses appeared in numbers companies of young men volun 
teered to carry the wounded from the battlefield and went out well 
equipped for their purpose under the guidance of medical men They 
were all trained and had some lessons in applying the tourniquet and 
bandaging As soon as they appeared in the field they had to place 
themselves under the command of the armysurgeons Hundreds of 
medical men went to the battlefields and into the hospitals either to 
help there or to accompany the trains with the sick and wounded to the 
different hospitals Wherever such a train was telegraphed to stop a 
short time all the medical men of the neighbourhood were ready to do 
their duty in renewing the bandages and hundreds of hands were 
stretched out to give refreshments of all kinds If our railway commu 
nication from the battlefields had been better no wounded soldier 
would have been lying on the field for so long as I am sorry to say 
they did in the beginning of the war 
VOLUNTEERS FOR THE NATIONAL AID SOCIETY FOR THE SICK 
AND WOUNDED 
WE are enabled to state that the Society does not intend at present to 
accept ary additional applications for service at all events from none 
bat those who can speak French and German fluently and who are 
prepared to give their services during the continuance of the war 
HOW SCARLATINA IS SPREAD 
THE remarks which have been recently made in the JOURNAL on the 
manner in which the infection of scarlatina is communicated from per 
son to person as a result of ignorance and neglect have had the effect 
of eliciting some valuable information We have received several im 
portant communications on the subject which are here subjoined 
One is from Dr George Johnson the Professor of Medicine in Kings 
College the second from Dr James Russell Physician to the Birming 
ham General Hospital and the third from Dr L 0 Fox of Broughton 
Dr Johnson writes as follows 
 I am rejoiced to find that you are directing the attention of your 
readers to the preventable causes of scarlet fever for I am sure that 
in doing so you will confer a great benefit upon the public I have long 
been convinced that the spread of this formidable disease is in a vast 
number of instances the result of gross culpable and even criminal 
negligence It is universally acknowledged that scarlet fever is highly 
contagious it is doubtful whether it ever results from any other cause 
although as with other contagious diseases it is not possible in every case 
to trace the source of infection Overcrowding and defective ventilation 
unquestionably favour the rapid spread of the disease through schools 
and other large establishments but there is no reason to suppose any 
special connection between scarlatina and filth bad drainage or impure 
water 
 I have known the case of several families becoming infected by scar 
latina within a few days after going into lodgings by the seaside The 
explanation of this is not difficult to find A case of scarlatina occurs 
perhaps in a London family As soon as the patient is convalescent but 
while the skin is still peeling and thus throwing off poisonous epidermis 
he goes by cab and railway to the seaside infecting the public carriages 
on his way and finally infecting the bedding and furniture of his 
lodging The proprietor of the lodging knows nothing of any infection 
therefore no disinfecting process is adopted and the next occupants of 
the lodgings take the disease 
 It is obviously the duty of persons who take a convalescent into a 
lodging while there is still risk of infection to state the facts of the case 
beforehand and to make arrangements for the subsequent disinfection 
of the bedding and furniture A lodginghouse keeper who neglects 
disinfection knowing it to be necessary not only incurs great moral 
guilt but is liable to a penalty of twenty pounds 
 In a seaside town where a few years since scarlatina was very pre 
valent this occurred as I was told by the residents on the spot A 
child died of the fever in a lodginghouse and the day after the funeral 
of that child another family ignorant of what had happened entered 
the very same apartments 
You have mentioned the case of a laundresss child taking the fever in 
consequence of infected clothes being sent without warning and there 
fore without the adoption of needful precautions I believe that this 
is a frequent source of infection The baskets used to convey the foul 
linen and the covers which are commonly made of woollen become 
infected and thus the infection may be communicated to the clean linen 
on its way home 
 The clothing and bedding of a scarlatina patient before it is sent to 
the wash should be scalded and then disinfected with carbolic acid 
 Quite recently I saw in consultation a child suffering from scarlatina 
his sister having died the day before of the same disease These were 
the children of a tailor whose workshop adjoined and opened into the 
the room occupied by the sick child This affords an illustration of the 
way in which new clothes may become infected 
A few days afterwards I saw another child sufferingfrom a malignant 
form of scarlatina and lying in a room at the back of a greengrocers 
shop The family who were in attendance upon the child were con 
tinually passing from the sick room into the shop to distribute fruit and 
vegetables to their customers 
 Some time since I was consulted about a young lady who had albumi 
nuria consequent on scarlatina A few days before this lady had sickened 
with the fever her pianoforte had been tuned by a man who was ob 
viously unwell and who it was afterwards ascertained had been 
suffering from scarlatina 
 When scarlatina is in a house casual visitors should be warned and 
excluded In the early part of the present year a young lady was ad 
mitted as a visitor at a house where several members were ill She 
afterwards learnt that the illness was scarlatina and a fortnight after 
wards she sickened with the disease A younger brother of this young 
lady some months before was seized with scarlatina five days after re 
turning to school after the holidays On inquiry it was found that the 
boy with whom he slept had suffered from scarlatina during the holidays 
 The master of a large school told me quite recently that one of his 
pupils while at home at the end of the holidays had symptoms which 
excited a suspicion of scarlatina nevertheless his parents sent him 
back to school Fortunately the disease proved not to be scarlatina 
About two years since an Oxford undergraduate sickened with scar 
latina and in obedience to orders from his parents he returned home 
travelling in a firstclass carriage with five other passengers while the 
eruption was fully out upon him 
Medical attendants especially those who practise midwifery should 
be careful to avoid conveying the disease to others washing and disin 
fecting the hands after touching a patient and driving or betterwalking 
in the open air are obvious precautions A friend of mine Dr B 
attributes the illness and death of one of his own children to his having 
taken the child with him in his brougham when he was visiting a suc 
cession of cases of scarlatina 
 It is notorious that articles of furniture or clothing if shut up without 
being cleansed and disinfected may be a source of danger for an indefinite 
period Some years ago the following illustration of this came to my 
knowledge A child on a visit to an unmarried aunt in the country 
sickened with scarlatina immediately after her arrival and it is probable 
that she took the disease with her The child died of the disease 
More than a year afterwards another niece on a visit to the same house 
took scarlatina and died On careful inquiry as to the probable source 
of infection it was found that a dressed doll which had been nursed by 
the first child during her illness and which since her death had been 
put away in a drawer had been taken out and given to the second 
child some days before she became ill What renders it the more 
probable that the dolls clothes were the source of infection is the fact 
that in the interval between the deaths of the two children some older 
children who had visited the house but who had neither seen nor 
touched the doll remained well 
Dr James Russell has addressed to us the following communica 
tion 
 It is greatly to be desired that the highly practical remarks you 
make respecting the propagation of scarlet fever may attract general 
attention I apprehend that an important feature in the poison of 
scarlet fever is the tenacity with which it attaches itself to articles of 
clothing particularly those of a woollen nature The following occur 
rences raise a collateral question How long will the contagium of 
scarlet fever retain its vitality or to speak without theory continue 
able to generate the disease I mention the first case simply as show 
ing the curious manner in which this question may present itself It 
would of course require very strong corroborative evidence to remove 
it from the category of coincidences The other two cases have a 
directly practical bearing A former physician to the General Hospital 
in this town intimately known to myself lost a sister from scarlet fever 
in early life The death occurred at a boardingschool The clothes 
were packed up in a carpetbag and sent in that state to the young
