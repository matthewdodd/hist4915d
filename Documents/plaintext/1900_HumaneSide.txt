PREVENTION AND CURE OF CAPE HORSE  
SICKNESS 
Amongst other matters brought into prominence by the 
war in South Africa is the disease of the horse known as 
 
Cape horse sickness As the nature of the operations 
renders mobility essential and the transport of men and 
material depends on the health of the horses employed 
the subject is of special interest and importance at the 
present time Though the morphology of the causal factor  
has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated and many 
points in the pathology of the disease remain for elucida 
tion it has been long known that the blood of an affected j 
animal is virulent and retains its power of inducing the 
disease for long periods outside the animal body under 
apparently adverse circumstances The disease is pro 
duced both by ingestion and subcutaneous inoculation of 
such blood and it is fully recognised that certain 
localities are especially dangerous Methods of prevention 
based on this knowledge have been adopted with varying 
success It is now most commonly believed that if horses 
are not allowed to graze on the veld in the dangerous dis 
tricts until the herbage has been dried by the sun they will 
probably escape the disease Notwithstanding all that is 
known of prophylaxis Cape horse sickness remains a 
matter of the utmost concern The exigencies of warfare 
often render adoption of the ordinary preventive measures 
impracticable Anything therefore which would render I 
the horses body an unsuitable soil for the virus would be a 
great desideratum hence the announcement in the Cape 
Times of April 24th 1900 by Mr George C Purvis MD 
BSc late Medical Assistant to the Bacteriological Institute 
Grahams Town of a method of preventing 
 
horse sickness 
 
and of effecting a cure in the majority of instances 
will be read with interest Dr Purvis alludes to the 
dangerous effects of fortified serum derived from 
immune horses and describes his single experiment on 
a horse He states that we started by injecting 
subcutaneously 20 ccm of serum  the next week the 
animal got 50 ccm the next week 75 ccm the next 
100 ccm the next week 150 ccm and about a week after 
200 ccm Fourteen days after 1 ccm virulent blood was 
given and the horse did not show any symptoms of horse 
sickness whatever 
 
The serum used was obtained from 
the blood of horses which had received a dose of virulent 
blood some five or six weeks or even longer before the 
blood is drawn for serum It is unfortunate that Dr 
Purvis has not been able to publish more than a single ex 
perience of his method This is hardly to be regarded as 
a solution of the fundamental questiondoes the iojection 
of serum confer immunity  Until this point is settled 
by a muchextended experience it is scarcely advisable to 
consider the practicability of adopting it as a prophylactic I 
measure It is to be hoped that Dr Purvis will subject 
his method to a much more convincing test than that now 
adduced and that the publication of his results will mark 
a step in the advance of useful knowledge on this subject j 
SIGNING BLANK MEDICAL CERTIFICATES 
A recent prosecution at Leeds for making and giving a 
medical certificate of the cause of death of an infant which 
was false because it had been signed in blank by one prac 
titioner while the cause of death was filled in by another 
practitioner who had never seen the infant is of some im 
portance The prosecution was instituted by order of the 
RegistrarGeneral and the following were the facts of the 
case  An infant died in Leeds fourteen days after it had 
been attended at the Leeds General Dispensary and the 
mother on application at that institution for a medical 
certificate was furnished with one by the locum tenens of 
the medical officer of the dispensary for which purpose he 
used one of several forms which the medical officer had 
signed in blank and left for use during his absence The 
local registrar on the production of this certificate elicited 
from the mother who came to register the death that the 
practitioner whose signature the certificate bore had not 
seen the child for fourteen days and therefore reported the 
case to the coroner who held an inquest thereon at which 
the circumstances of the case were fully investigated 
Subsequently the case was reported to the Registrar 
General who instructed the Superintendent for Leeds 
to prosecute for making and giving a false certifi 
cate in contravention of the provisions of Section xl 
of the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1874 At 
the adjourned hearing of the case the Leeds stipendiary 
magistrate while recognising that the defendants had no 
improper motive in making and giving this certificate 
expressed the opinion that the RegistrarGeneral deserved 
the thanks of the public for instituting the prosecution 
He decided however that the case would be met as the 
RegistrarGeneral did not press for heavy penalties by 
fining the medical officer 2 for signing the blank form of 
certificate and his locum tenens 1 for inserting the cause 
of death of the infant whom ne had never seen The 
grave objections to the practice of leaving signed blank 
forms for medical certificates for use during the absence 
of the certifying practitioner it is unnecessary to dwell 
upon and the result of this recent prosecution ought to 
be widely known 
THE HUMANE SIDE OF WARFARE 
Dr Nicholas Senn in a recent number of the Journal oj 
the American Medical Association says that the most pleas 
ing features of modern warfare are the efforts made in all 
civilised countries to make it more and more humane 
The horrors of Sebastopol Gettysburg Solferino Sedan 
and other great battles during the present century will he 
thinks have no equal in the future Governments and 
nations are beginning to realise more fully the import 
ance of providing the soldier with food and clothing con 
ducive to the preservation of his health and bringing into 
effective action sanitary rules calculated to guard against 
preventable diseases After referring to the beneficent 
work of the Red Cross and other philanthropic societies 
he says that the neutral grounds near the line of battle on 
each side are the places where thehumane side of modern as 
compared with ancient warfare is most vividly exhibited 
He describes a few instances of the kind which happened 
during the late SpanishAmerican 
war during his service 
in the field a chief of the operating staff A few days 
after the battles of El Caney and San Juan he was invited 
by Dr Goodfellow to accompany him on a trip to El Caney 
and from there to the Spanish line as instructions had 
been received from headquarters to transfer a number of 
wounded Spaniards across the American line The Spanish 
officers whom they met were welleducated and polished 
gentlemen While waiting for the ambulances cigarettes 
were freely passed around and all kinds of subjects out 
side the war were freely discussed in the shade of a 
group of palm trees About the time the ambulances 
arrived a Spanish surgeon with 30 hospital corps men 
and the necessary amount of litters made his appearance 
According to Dr Senn the Spanish compared very 
favourably with the American litters He says that there 
can be no longer any question that the Spaniards respected 
the humane side of warfare although during the war the 
American press frequently took occasion to state the con 
trary It was asserted that the Spaniards did not respect 
the Red Cross and that wounded and noncombatants 
under the protection of the Red Cross flags were frequently 
fired upon Dr Senn has reason to believe from what he 
saw during his service in Cuba and Porto Rico that these 
statements were made on altogether insufficient grounds

It is true that medical officers litter bearers and wounded 
men on stretchers who were being conveyed to the rear 
were killed and wounded but such accidents will occur 
during any battle as long as the firstaid dressing is carried 
out as it should be near the fighting line The modern 
small calibre weapon sends the deadly missile a distance 
of three miles and injuries to noncombatants within this 
range are unavoidable He adds that the small Red Cross 
flags used in the field cannot be distinguished with the 
naked eye for anything like the distance travelled by the 
modern bullet No gross violation of any of the articles of 
the Geneva Convention can he affirms be laid at the door  
of the Spaniards Perhaps one of the best proofs that the 
Spaniards conducted the war on the most humane prin 
ciples is to be found in what occurred during the first 
skirmish after the landing of the American troops in Porto 
Rico A small Spanish force occupied the summit of one 
of the foothills and opened fire The American troops 
charged and a 
young private of one of the Pennsylvania 
regiments in his enthusiasm advanced far beyond his 
line The day was extremely hot and when he came 
within a short distance of the brow of the hill he 
fell unconscious A Spanish surgeon immediately rushed 
forward to render first aid administered stimulants and 
had the soldier at once conveyed on a stretcher to the 
American line Another very pleasing evidence of the 
humane nature of recent warfare came to Dr Senns 
knowledge at Mayaguez Porto Rico After a somewhat 
lively skirmish near the suburbs of this place the enemy 
retreated and the wounded from both sides were conveyed 
to the same hospital He found the Spaniards on one side 
of the large room and the Americans on the other all of 
them being under the care of the same nursing sisters of a 
Spanish order who in their ministrations made no dis 
tinction between friend and enemy It was interesting to 
observe how the men who but a few days before did their 
utmost to kill or wound each other were now on the most 
friendly terms They exchanged little articles of comfort 
such as tobacco cigarettes fruits and relics of the war in 
a manner that did not recall the experiences of a few years 
ago It is pleasant to have such irrefragable testimony 
borne to the conduct of the Spaniards in the late war for 
it may be remembered that certain of the American news 
papers persistently held them up to the execration of man 
kind for their alleged disregard of the rules of civilised 
warfare Such charges are sure to be made in the heated 
state of national feeling generated by a war When the j 
history of the present struggle in South Africa comes to be 
written in cold blood even the Boer will doubtless be 
painted in less lurid colours than he now is by writers 
whose patriotic ardour makes them 
 see red or yellow 
PROFESSIONAL SECRECY IN THE UNITED STATES 
The Newhaven Medical Association has lately had the 
question of professional secrecy under consideration It 
appears that in a recent trial in the Superior Court of the 
State of Connecticut a medical practitioner of good 
standing was compelled to answer against his protest a 
question relating to knowledge obtained by him in a pro 
fessional communication from his patient The decision 
of the Court was based upon the common law rule at pre 
sent governing such cases in the State According to this 
law while the confidential communications of a client to 
an attorney shall be considered as privileged and shall not 
be disclosed as testimony in the Courts the confidential 
communicatios of a patient to a medical practitioner or 
of a penitent to a priest or other clergyman shall not be 
deemed privileged and must be divulged in the Courts as 
testimony The State of New York some years ago passed 
a statute overruling the commonlaw rule and this statute 
has since been adopted practically without change by 
seventeen other American States and territories The 
Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New York provides 
that  A person duly authorised to practise physic or sur 
gery shall not be allowed to disclose any information which 
he acquired in attending a patient in a professional 
capacity The Newhaven Medical Association being of 
opinion that the discrimination against medical men and 
clergymen regarding confidential disclosures under the 
commonlaw rule is against the best interests of public 
policy and of society urges that the rule of common law 
should be overruled by the enactment of a statute similar 
to that of New York State 
A REPENTANT SCHOOL BOARD 
The School Board forfLondon have appointed Robert J 
Collie MD Medical Superintendent of the Boards Am 
bulance and Home Nursing Classes The number of 
pupils who received instruction in ambulance and home 
nursing last winter was close on 10000 and the 
Board has decided that all ambulance classes shall be 
taught by medical men assisted by the Boards teachers 
Each course consists of twelve lectures given alternately 
by the medical man and the Boards teacher As we an 
nounced last week the Boardwhich for the last two years 
has offered only half a guinea for a lecture lasting one hour 
and ahalfhas now advertised its willingness to pay one 
guinea a lecture Whether this change of remuneration is 
due to the reported difficulty in obtaining registered prac 
titioners at the smaller fee or to the recent appointment 
of a medical superintendent we cannot say but it is a 
matter for congratulation that the Lomdon School Board 
has ceased to set so bad an example to other Boards It 
must at any rate be admitted that the fee of one guinea 
is by no means too much when it is remembered that the 
lecturer has no allowance for travelling expenses and pro 
bably has to spend about three hours in earning the 
remuneration offered We are informed that until recently 
the pupils were presented for examination by the St John 
Ambulance Association but that the Board have now de 
termined in future to grant their own certificate 
THE COLONIAL NURSING ASSOCIATION 
The report presented to the annual meeting of this Asso 
ciation at Stafford Home on May 23rd over which Earl 
Grey presided showed that 56 nurses sent out by the Asso 
ciation are now at work in the Colonies  39 in Government 
employment and 17 engaged in private nursing The gain 
to the Colonies more especially Crown Colonies where 
hitherto natives mostly coolies have constituted the nursing 
staff by introducing skilled British nurses is wellnigh in 
calculable Medical men in the tropics are hampered by 
the want of efficient nurses and the good already done in 
providing nurses although considerable is but infinitesimal 
when the enormous field for their services is considered 
Tropical ailments are often so sudden in reaching a crisis 
that the medical man often finds that he is tied 
to the bedside of a single patient for a day or 
two during which time be has both to treat the 
patient and to nurse him The inconvenience caused to 
other patients the detriment to the welfare of the patient 
by the same person acting as doctor and nurse and 
the tax on the strength of the doctor is a serious matter in 
a district where perhaps no other medical man is within 
call Sir George White who was present at the meeting 
strenuously advocated the provision of trained nurses for 
India and for the Colonies We would however urge the 
importance of having nurses trained even it may be par 
tially in nursing tropical ailments before leaving home 
At the Seamens Hospital London and at Liverpool a 
course of training for nurses about to proceed to the tropics 
is now given and we have no hesitation in impressing upon 
the Colonial Nursing Association the advantages of drawing 
their nurses only from amongst those who have had such 
training Of the 5000 required 2000 has already been
