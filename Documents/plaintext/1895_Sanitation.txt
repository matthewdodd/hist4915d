period of their history have adopted the ideas and practical 
methods of Western nations and who day by day are 
proving how vain it is for ignorance and barbarism to 
resist them 
Colonel Maurices question then is easily answered All 
past experience teaches that when human beings are col 
lected in masses and kept for any length of time under such 
noxious influences as he describes the Nemesis of neglect of 
simple hygiene is quick to punish those who defy her laws 
and ignore her teaching and very probably could the actual 
state of matters be known he would find that the penalty is 
already being exacted though no doubt when heat and 
moisture are added thawing the snow saturating the 
ground and fouling the water with the products of decom 
posing organic matter and diffusing the germs of disease 
ochletic and zymotic maladies will rapidly within a few 
days or at most weeks become more prevalent and destruc 
tive and his vaticination will speedily be realised in the 
Spread of fever bowel complaints and other diseases 
In his brief but graphic account of the present and pro 
spective conditions of Pekin and its environs Colonel 
Maurice gives a description of conditions which will inevi 
tably entail the direful results to which he looks forward 
and it is a duty of all who speak with authority and experi 
ence on such questions to emphasise the warning and 
endorse the recommendation he has given to all who can do 
so without neglect of duty to make their escapethe sooner 
the betterfrom the surely impending evil which in some 
form may break out at any time 
A recent issue of the Daily Graphic contains a striking 
sketch of the method adopted by the Japanese of disposing 
of the slain after a battle The bodies of the dead are 
placed in light cases and are cremated in a large fire 
kindled for the purpose It would appear from this that the 
Japanese have acquired from their European instructors in 
military organisation and tactics wise sanitary ideas as to 
the best methods of disposing of their dead It would pro 
bably be generally admitted by sanitarians that however 
religious belief or other motive may influence the disposal 
of the dead during a pestilence or after a great action th 
safest method is by cremation if it can be properly carried 
out 
In 1871 the battlefields of the FrancoPrussian war 
brought this question into prominence The French Govern 
ment was then urged to apply cremation to bodies dead on 
battlefields but it would not appear that this has been sub 
sequently adopted toany extent in recent wars Cremation 
however as a popular method of disposing of the dead 
would seem to be gaining ground slowly Gotha was the first 
European Government that authorised the practice In 
most European countries it is under certain restrictions 
tolerated rather than encouraged and whilst the conditions 
exist for burial under due sanitary precautions there is abso 
lutely no necessity from that point of view for cremation but 
for the slain after a great battle in crowded populations and 
great cities in any locality where pestilence may prevail and 
where the number of dead may be much in excess of the 
earths space that would be available for the disposal of 
disintegrating bodies there cannot be a doubt that crema 
tion properly carried out would be a most effective sanitary 
proceeding and its adoption worthy of due consideration

SATURDAY FEBRUARY 2nd 1895 
SANITATION IN WAR 
Colonel Maurice in an article in the United Service 
Magazine for February on the War between China and 
Japan points out that in reference to the sanitary conditions 
of the mass of human beings now assembling round Pekin 
 a medical question of the greatest general interest heeds 
to be answered It is within what time after the warm 
moist weather sets in ought we to expect actual illness to 
follow upon the hopeless sanitary neglect of vast disorderly 
congregations of men with many neglected animals col 
lected around that city   
It appears that in anticipation of an assault on Pekin by 
the Japanese the Chinese are collecting round that city half 
a million of men who have next to ho discipline or 
organisation and hardly any knowledge of what these 
words mean whilst everywhere they show vby their filthy 
habits that they have not the faintest idea of the most 
ordinary military or sanitary precautions He surmises 
that so long as the dry cold weather lasts no danger will 
ensue from the gathering of this host about Pekin but he 
pertinently asks what will happen when the snow which 
has been fouled by hundreds of thousands of men and ani 
mals melts in the spring P And he concludes that as soon 
as the warm moist weather sets in the consequence must 
be a frightful outbreak of pestilence of a malignant type 
The geographical position of Pekin situated in a sandy 
alluvial plain in 40 N latitude places it as it were on the 
boundary line of subtropical disease The extremes of 
climate are great 0 F to 104 F the mean annual tempera 
ture is 52 F  the mean winter range is 12 below freezing 
The rainfall which occurs chiefly in July and August is less 
than 16 inches These physical and climatic conditions so 
far warrant the anticipation that disease both of the tropical 
and temperate zone characters may be expected  and con 
sidering the ignorance of and disbelief in the efficacy of 
sanitary precautions intensified by naturally filthy habits 
impure drinking water and squalor of living the demoralisa 
tion of defeat the crowding of vast numbers of men in in 
sanitary dwellings and the absence of discipline and moral 
control it may well happen that diseases such as fevers 
dysentery diarrhoea cholera may at any time rapidly 
assume a virulent and epidemic type destructive to life and 
fatal to the prospect of successfully resisting the attack of 
the gifted nation which within so comparatively recent a

the Japanese social and military systems of the present 
day that they should have adopted this procedure and so 
far as we may judge it seems to be done decently and with 
due respect to the dead 
Much might be said no doubt from the sentimental 
aspect of the question But it must be remembered 
however the process is brought about that the body has 
to be resolved into its original elements and obviously if 
the number of dead be excessive it is desirable that this 
process should be effected with the least danger to the 
living Dr Parkes pointed out that neither affection nor 
religion can be outraged by any method of disposal of the 
dead which is done with the proper solemnity and respect to 
the bodythe earthly dwelling place of the departed The 
question is one to be considered entirely from a sanitary 
point of view 
With respect to the common methods of disposing of the 
dead after battlesburying them in trenches often but 
too shallow so tainting the air soil and subsoil water 
it is to be remembered that the results of this method 
might continue for years to be a source of disease Whilst 
it is quite admitted that a body placed at a certain depth 
below the soil in proper and suitable earth is gradually 
disintegrated and resolved into its constituents this is not 
the case where numbers are crowded together in insufficient 
space in soil perhaps not suited to the purpose 
The only doubt with reference to the cremation of the 
dead on the battlefield would be whence the necessary 
amount of fuel would be forthcoming  but of course given 
a sufficiency of that so as to ensure complete cremation no 
better sanitary method of disposing of the dead could be 
found 
Whatever sentiment may say upon the subject the result 
is the same ultimately whether it take place in a few hours 
under the influence of heat or whether it take place in a 
few years under the influence of natural processesthe 
resolution of the body into its constituent elements We 
are therefore inclined to commend the proceedings of the 
Japanese always assuming that the process is completely 
and thoroughly effected and to express a conviction that 
other nations would do well to follow their example in 
times of war or pestilence whatever may be their custom of 
disposing of the dead under ordinary conditions 
GENERAL PARALYSIS 
The old proverbIt is the pace that killsfinds nowhere a 
more striking illustration than in this disease which under 
the hurry anxiety and excitement of modern life is be 
coming more and more common For some unexplained 
reason the affection is more common in this country than in 
many others and is comparatively speaking infrequent in 
Scotland This has been explained by Northern patriots as 
another illustration of the harmlessness of whisky as com 
pared with beer a fallacious argument for the onset of 
general paralysis may have been preceded by no excesses 
and given other factors may occur in total abstainers But 
while much with regard to the etiology remains obscure one 
factor is almost always to be traced namely hard work 
under conditions of excitement and responsibility 
Among the educated classes it is men and occasion 
ally women in the prime of life whose careers are arrested 
at the point when success is almost in their grasp Among 
skilled artisans too it is often the industrious earnest man 
who is singled outthe man who is always anxious about 
the quality of his work and will work all night if allowed 
to finish his task And there are many though not so large a 
number as is usually imagined in whom previous excess 
appears to have caused the onset of symptoms  but in many 
cases this conclusion is due to a confusion between cause 
and effect since in most cases of general paralysis a certain 
amount of moral perversion is symptomatic of the early 
stage of the disease The disease is practically confined 
to the first half of adult life and those who have stood the 
strain until they are 50 need have little fear of being 
attacked by this terrible complaint 
The name of the disease gives little guidance to the sym 
ptoms met with and many different clinical groups are 
classed under the same head One feature unhappily is 
common to them allthe progressive character of the 
paralysis and the absence of any hope of recovery medicine 
being powerless at present to do more than delay the inevi 
table result In all forms also when the disease is once 
established there is gradual steady failure of the physical 
and mental powers of the patient until finally the paralysis 
becomes complete and death closes the scene 
There is probably no disease of such gravity in which the 
onset is more insidious On looking back when the physical 
weakness etc have become marked and the disease has 
declared itself symptoms are remembered lasting for years 
past which by themselves seem trivial and are looked on 
as mere accentuation of personal peculiarities but which 
taken together have the gravest significance Restless 
unwonted activity mental and physical is of frequent occur 
rence a feeling of superabundant energy for which there 
appears no adequate relief  often undue irritability which 
will not brook control or contradiction an unreasonable 
demand upon the time and indulgence of others  wayward 
ness fickleness or outbursts of furious passion upon trivial 
pretexts in those who had previeusly been more selfcon 
trolled and amiable  a growing change in the disposition 
and character usually signalised by perversion of some one 
or more of the moral sentiments a fact of primary import 
from the medicolegal point of view Such is the descrip 
tion of the symptoms found grouped in most early cases 
given some years ago by one of the greatest living 
authorities1 The occurrence of some of these symptoms 
separately is common in healthy persons but when 
several of them occur together and persist a close watch 
should be kept for any more definite signs These 
usually occur from the physical side There is no longer 
the power of executing finely coordinated movements 
the right hand has lost its cunning tremulousness of the 
facial muscles of expression becomes prominent and a 
similar tremulousness affects the muscles of articulation so 
that the speech can scarcely be distinguished from the thick 
slurring speech of intoxication for which it is frequently 
mistaken The subsequent course of the disease varies 
remarkably in different cases In many there is mental 
excitement with the development of delusions of grandeur 
followed ultimately by dementia and the description of this 
classical form is too well known to require further comment 
But in a considerable number of cases met with in practice
