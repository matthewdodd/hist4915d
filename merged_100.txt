KING IM S is a book of over i6o pages defining and explaining the duties of a plague inspector in India It was written be cause something of the kind was asked for over and over again by plague supervisors to guide them in their work Dr King has accomplished the task he has set himself in a most satisfactory manner The book is free from technical medical r hraseology and is written in a style that can be readily fol lowed by laymen It is divided into two parts Part I begins with a short account of plague a description of the plague microbe with the favourable and unfavourable conditions for its vitality thp animals that suffer from plague the incu bation period of plague the products of the plague microbe mode of entry of the microbe into the system and the mode of exit of the microbe from the body Then follow the symptomtntology of the disease its mode of transmission and the organisation for prevention of spread the regulation of passenger traffic by sea and the regulation of importation of articles from infeeted areas or country The duties of the sanitary inspector with reference to plague are carefully and minutely gone into and includes arrangements for home segregation removal to hospital house to house inspection formation of health camps and disinfection Part II refers more to the general duties of a sanitary inspector and deals more especially with conservancy and sewage dispos al We hope the labour which LieutenantColonel King has expended on this manual will bear fruit and that full advantage will be taken of the knowledge he has placed within the reach of those engaged in sanitary work in Indlia A Manual of Pharmaceutical Testing by BARNARD S PROCTOR FIC gives such directions for testing as will show the

an arch support for flat feet It consists as seen in the illustration of a thin plate of steel in two planes one of which is deeply dentated and forms a lateral support for the arch of the foot it fits in between the os calcis and the ends of the metatarsal bones The plate is covered with leather when in use It is claimed that the springs indi vidually yield to pressure and thus accommodate themselves to the undersurface of the arch but collectively offer suffi cient resistance to prevent the stretching ef the ligaments The flat part of the steel plate being under the outer part of the foot is fixed and acts as a fulcrum from which the springs play This sprtLng plate is an endeavour to combine the advantages of the elastic rubber pad with the firm sup port given by a Whitmans brae and as such it will probably be of service in cases of early flat foot with islight bony dis placement A Modified Displaysg Nasal SpeculumDr G SANDIsoN BRaoOK Rome writes In the

thoroughly and when in use is apt to be in the way during an operation Thus in the removal of certain varieties of polypi after the speculum has been used to facilitate the fixing of the snare it would be an undoubted advantage if during the actual operation it could be removed from the nose To overcome these disadvantages 1 have had the instrument modified by the addition of a couple of screws so that it can be readily separated into halves and when operating freed from the snare at the will of the user After a fair experience I am certain that the modi fication is an improvement

Medical Journal of November 25th published SurgeonGeneral G M Sternbergs Medical Report of the United States Army for the Financial Year i8989 It deals with the fiscal year ending June 30th 1899 and consists of two parts the first financial the second dealing with the health of the trooPs As it embraces the active period of the Spanish war it is of special interest to us in its bearing on our South African cam paign FINANCIAL STATEMENT This statement at once shows how widely the constitution of the medical service of the United States army differs from our own in possessing a complete financial autonomy em bracing the procuring and distribution of hospital supplies and even inclading what is properly looked upon as largely a medical dutyrecruiting and mustering out of invalids It is therefore only in certain directions that the two services can be fairly compared APPROPRIATION AND EXPENDITURE The money voted for the medical service during the year in review was 3750000 about 765000 of which there was expended 2750000 about Z564000 The large item in these accounts is medical supplies This we take to embrace hospital dietary which in a country like the United States is sure to be on a very liberal scale Other considerable items are for medical attendance and medicines pay of  nurses  and other  employees  hos pital washing etc MEDICAL OFFICERS The number of medical officers in the regular army was i92 which was barely sufficient for the needs of the service in time of peace with a strength of 25000 men and of course utterly insufficient for the war or to meet an increase in the establishment of regulars independent of volunteer estab lishments It was therefore necessary to employ about 940  contraet surgeons during the year of whom 385 were still serving on July ist I899 Sometbing of the same kind is now going on in our own undermanned medical establishments FEMALE NURSES The female contract nurses reached a maximum of I200 in September I898 and 202 were still employed on July ist 1899 HOSPITAL SHIPS The Belief and the Missouri which were Government ships did excellent service between Cuba and the Philippines and the home country but the Aid formerly the Bay State and the Terry proved unsuited for hospital purposes for reasons which are not given RECRUITING During the calendar year 1898 66237 white and 5013 coloured recruits were examined for the regular army of that a little over 20 per cent only were rejected This is much below the primary rejections among our own recruits and apparently admits of a double explanation First men in America are enlisted up to a later age and are therefore more developed secondly the medical examination is evi dently less exacting Nevertheless the chief cause of rejec tion there as here is defective physique while defective vision seems more common than with us and diseases of the  circulatory system which we presume can only mean varix and varicocele and cardiac affections among recruits are also more common Irish and Germans formerly constituted a fifth of the United States regular army or 200 in every iooo but they have recently steadily decreased until in 1895 they were but go per IooO  the native born have risen correepondingly Notwithstanding the smallness of the army and the large ness of the recruiting field and the consequent opportunity for strict selection a considerable  delinquent  and  unde sirable element has constantly to be weeded out of the United States forces of which some figures are given i688 In B THE SPANISHAMERICAN WAR DEo i6 1899 HEALTH OF THE ARMY It is noted with regret that even in the regulars and still more among the volunteers failure to keep and furnish accurate and complete recordsespecially in Cuba during July and Augustmakes the returns incomplete and the ratios less than they undoubtedly actually were this how ever with the scratch medical establishment employed is scarcely to be wondered at REGULAR ARMY With a mean strengtlh for the war year of 46635 the admissions were at the rate of 2136 per iooo or over two entries per man and double the entries during peace The excess was due to various camp diseases of which the chief were malarial affections and typhoid fever The deathrate was 2755 per ioCo against a decennial average of 699 or nearly four times the normal amount The number of days sick for each man was likewise double the average Of the different corps the infantry suffered most but the deathrate was very high among hospital attendants chiefly from typhoid fever contracted in their ministrations on the sick The admissions were especially swollen by malarial dis eases but there were no fewer than 4130 admissions from typhoid and 604 from yellow fever there were only I547 from gunshot wounds The deathrate of 2755 per iooo was made up thus Typhoid fever 974 gunshot wounds 394 malarial fevers 324 diarrhcea and dysentely 214 yellow fever I5o injuries other than gunshot i6i all other causes 538 Although the troops were exposed to dangerous infection in the islands from smallpox there were only 19 cases and 7 deathssuch was the efficiency of revaccination The highest admissionrate was in Porto Rico and Cuba that in the Philippines was the same as in the United States itself The total deaths between May ist 1898 and June 30th I899 among regulars and volanteers was 66I9 or an annual rate of 3303 per iooo of strength altocated as follows Cuba 4514 Porto Rico 38I5 Manila 1720 United Stattes Regulars 1743 volunteers 2667 Typhoid fever aocounted for more than half the deaths from disease and was worst in Porto Rico yellow fever was worst in Cuba SANITARY CONDITION The sanitary condition of the permanent camps before the war was excellent but the new camps formed on the out break of the war and filled with undisciplined volunteers speedily became hotbeds of disease especially of typhoid fever from which they suffered severely in July and August Much good sanitary work has been done in Cuba since its occuDation in December last so that the amount of sickness in the camps and garrison has been much less than was expected scattered cases of yellow fever have occurred but its absence in epidemic form has afforded great satisfaction The sanitary measures brought to bear on Santiago hitherto one of the most unhiealthy spots in Cuba have proved remark ably successful In Porto Rico also effective sanitation has been equally successful in controlling disease and especially has an important attempt been made to suppress its worst diseasesmallpox by wholesale vaccination of the popula tion For that purpose a vaccine farm was formed at Coamo Springs Sanitary measures at Manila and elsewhere in the Philip pines have been carried out with great labour but with much success so that the sickness and mortality have been not only relatively but absolutely low WATER SUPPLIES Much attention has been bestowed on this point so that the supply to the various camps has uniformly been excellent In no case was the rapid spread of typhoid conceded to be due to water pollution Various methods of sterilising drinking water have been tried but simple boiling was found at once the readiest and most effectual although it makes the water insipid and un popular The best filtering agents were found to be an asbestos strainer with a cylinder of compact infusorial earth The whole question of sterilising and aerating water was re ferred to a Board who recommended the use of the apparatus known as the WaterhouseForbes water steriliser CONSERVANCY The disposal of exereta in pits in camps of any long stand ing was found to be fraught with danger unless most vigilantly looked after and constantly disinfected After various experiments the most promising method was that known as the  trough system with removal of the contents by pneumatic pressure This has been successfully esta blished in several camps FOOD SUPPLIES The subsistence or as we call it the supply departments worked exceedingly well and were constantly efficient Many reports were received that the ordinary home ration was un suited for the tropics in containing too much of the fatty and too little of the starchy elements The 6o per cent allowance for subsistence in hospitals proved more than ample and enabled the medical officers to provide freely every delicacy for the sick indeed a 40 per cent allowance is declared to be sufficient CLOTHING The blue uniform used in the States was found too heavy for Cuba and the Philippines and the woollen undershirts caused much irritation from prickly heat Canvas suits until washed soft were found to be too stiff and heavy and caused chafing and a similar complaint was made of one of the khaki issues The British Indian helmet was found the best headgear although after the rains set in the campaign hat  was found to have certain advantages over the helmet The clothing finally recommended in the tropics is a light weight woollen undershirt cotton drawers white duck for garrison and khaki for field service CONCLUSIONS From all of the foregoing it will be seen the experiences of our American friends in tropical warfare have been singularly like our own and confirm what has long been well known to our army medical officers We look less for new facts than for the application of new methods which their great inventive skill is likely to evolve SurgeonGeneral Sternberg concludes his report with cer tain recommendations concerning his army medical service which are equally applicable to our own and which we have long and often urged on our War Office He points out the entire inadequacy of the regular army medical service and urges its increase as soon as practicable He says  Physicians and surgeons from civil life however well qualified professionally as a rule are not prepared to assume the responsibilities of medical officers charged with administrative duties and sanitary supervision of camps The proper performance of such duties cannot be expected from  physician without military training or experience no matter how distinguished a position he may have held in civil life He urges the organisation of  a corps of trained medical officers larger than is absolutely necessary for the army on a peace basis He has thus found the danger and difficulty of a scratch medical organisation in time of war a lesson which indeed may yet be brought home to ourselves As the war with Spain evolved the weak points of the American army system so our own deficiencies are certain to be found out in the Boer war It must be the immediate business of the nation to remedy them IDIOCY IN THE BALEARIC ISLANDSE J5ajarnes y Tur in a recent number of the Revista Balear de Scienc Med compares the number of idiots in the Balearic Islands with that in Spain He finds that both in the islands and in the town of Palma de Mallorca just as in Spain and France idiocy more commonly affected the male than the female sex and that the number of cases of acquired idiocy was greater than that of congenital idiocy The proportion of idiots in Spain was 054 per Icoo in the Balearic Islands it was o43 per Icoo and in the town of Palma it was o63 per iooo The high percent age in Palma is ascribed specially to sociological conditions Modern Surgery In WarSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 1955 Jun 18 1898

it has been found possible to bring home some of the woundedin Egypt without changing the aseptic dressings applied when tthewoundsjwere first treated will have been heard with great satisfaction It is in fact a triumph for good surgery and good organisation and proves that military surgery has shared to the full in the remarkable advance in surgical ideals and methods which the present generation has witnessed The ideals which surgeons have had before them in regard to the healing of wounds at various epochs form indeed a very interesting part of the history of surgery and especially of military surgery Very great changes have taen place in the standards set up even in our own times and nothing has ever done more to diminish the sufferings of the wounded than the introduction of aseptic methods which render it not only unnecessary but undesirable to resort to the fre quent dressing of wounds which used to be obligatory Many surgeons who have hardly yet reached middle life can remember the anxiety with which some Nestor of his youth looked out for a free discharge of what he would call laudable pus  from all but the simplest wounds To this exudation he looked to carry off especially in lacerated wounds all the bruised and torn tissue whose vitality was destroyed by the violence inflicted His ideal was only realised when dressings were rapidly soaked with discharges so that they needed to be frequently changed and he encouraged this state of things by poultices and fomepa1aions in great variety Later on in the earlier days of the antiseptic perind the hope of surgeons appeared to lie in the destruction by chemical antiseptics of all the forms of low vegetable life which under ordinary conditions gained access to most wounds and in the carrying off by means of numerous drainage tubes all blood and exuded serum which might have formed a favourable soil for these organisms But the drawbacks of this treatment soon became apparent In the laudable efforts to destroy the germs which were correctly recognised as the cause of dangerous inflammation conditions were produced which were actually hostile to the healing of wounded tissues The chemicals employed not only destroyed the microbes but also many of the tissue elements And not only had the latter to be shed off before healing could take place but in the process of elimination and under the stimulus of the germicides increased exudation took place which required elaborate provision for the escape of fluid from wounds and the reception and disinfection of the latter in special dress ings which called for frequent change lest they in their tum should become the soil for organic life This though tending in the right direction and affording a necessary transition from the older methods was based upon a false ideal The chemicals irritated the wounds the secretion was consequently greater This called for frequent inter ference with the injured part and consequent risk of fresh infection from without at each exposure But not only this but one of the greatest factors in healing namely physiolo gical rest was not maintained and the debilitated patient was put to much physical pain as well as psychical distress both serious depressants of vitality in themselves Our present ideal is different The highest aim of wound treatment is now to see that Nature is left as much as pos sible to herself To this end we exclude ferments from wounds by every known means applied to the surrounding air the dressing utensils instruments and hands brought in contact with the injured part We do as little as possible to the actual wound whether with antiseptics or by manipu lation and so secure a maximum of rest and a minimum of pain and fright to the patient and if by these means the wound is left clean and at rest Nature will do the remainder The case of an excision of a joint well illustrates this change which has come about In our fathers days if such an operation was attempted at all which on account of its greatmortality was rare free suppuration was provided for as a matter of course for weeks and months and the patient suffered untold misery all through this long after treatment on account of the constant dressing of the wound and the physical and mental unrest thereby entailed Then came the blessings of the antiseptic period with the elimination of infection but with the drain tubes and the still frequent dressing and interference with the damaged part We have now arrived at a point where by the aseptic treatment wounds are left in a state of rest untouched until healed under one dressing in nine out of ten cases It is indeed becoming a very common experience to see these large and complicated wounds of joints as well as of cther parts left absolutely undisturbed under the dressing put on at the operation until the tenth day The dressing is only then removed because the woand has been perfectly healed Indeed inconsiderate patients are often dissatisfied because so little has been done for their wound They think it ought to have been looked at at least once every day or so And when the surgeon who has put forth all his powers based upon his knowledge of pathological and physiological processes as well as the experience of countless cases points triumphantly on the tenth day to an absolute union without a spot of pus and without drainage the patient often quietly says Yes I have excellent healing flesh and ignores his part altogether ignorant of the fact that only the surgeons conecintious and patient carrying out of countless details in principle and manipulation have saved him from all the disasters of sepsis In some cases even he is reproached with having done so little and consequently receives but scant gratitude In no branch of surgery has this rapid evolution of ideals been more strikingly illustrated than in the treatment of bullet wounds The poultice or frequently changed water I6o6 TMITNl 1 FAITHHEALING IN ANCIENT GREECE JIUNE 18 189 dressing with all its foulness and risk gave way at first to the cumbrous ritual of the antiseptic period with its greatly reduced risks of septic infection but with its constant change of dressings and frequent irrigation with chemicals Then with the more perfect knowledge of the nature of infection and of its sources came the knowledge that these could be eliminated by attention to the perfect cleansing of the media which must almost necessarily come into contact with wounds sooner or later An ideal has thus been reached which for simplicity and the excellence of its results would excite our fathers could they see it almost to incredulity The modern soldier now carries in his knapsack simple simple antiseptic dressings to be applied at once by himself or his comrade to his wound The aim of this dressing is less to act as a germdestroying covering for the wound itself that to protect the latter from the access of microbes from without and with such a dressing the wound can be left untouched for days and frequently to complete cicatrisation with perfect impunity Indeed one of its greatest advantages is that with it exposure of the wound with all its risks of infection is rendered unnecessary In short the ideal which the civil surgeon places before himself in dealing with the terrible wounds of modern operations is realised in the far simpler wounds made by the modern smallbore projectile with its high velocity and cleancut hole Those soldiers are indeed fortunnte who when wounded fall into the hands of military surgeons who fully grasp the prin ciples of asepsis They conscientiously carry out its details and their confidence in the precautions for warding off sepsis is such that they positively forbid the removal of a dressing once applied to a bullet wound with due regard to asepsis so long as pulse temperature and general condition indicate that Nature is left undisturbed in her healing powers These surgeons will then order their patients to be removed at once from the seat of war with a permanent antiseptic dressing and so will prevent that overcrowding of field or base hospitals which in former days not only hampered the commanders in their military movements but also led to those outbursts of wound infections which swept away countless valuable lives Some of us who have seen the horrors of war under the old r4gime must feel deeply thankful that we now possess in our soldiersurgeons men fully impressed with the newer teaching and with the courage and confidence to give effect to it in their own noble work The Greek Asklepieia had a twofold character for they were sanatoria as well as shrines It is difficult to say which of these characters predominated in the earlier days pro bably both existed in varying degree at different times and in different places according to the mental constitution of those who had the direction of affairs As Dr Caton points out sometimes the Hierophant was a physician and in such a case it may reasonably be conjectured that hygiene and medical treatment had a prominent place in the  cure But for the most part the priestly element was preponderant in the staff of the Asklepieia and the treatment was thus largely of a spiritual nature Hence gradually the shrine overshadowed the sanatorium till the temples of Asklepios became simply places to which superstitious or despairing invalids resorted in the hope of a cure by miraculous agency As the first dawn of rational medicine brightened more and more into day the thaumaturgic powers of the shrines became dis credited and their glory finally departed when the old gods were driven from Olympus by the triumph of Christianity It has been said that the Asklepieia were to some extent sanatoria and accordingly great care seems to have been takens in the selection of their sites That of Epidaurue was situated in a pleasant valley and well sheltered by woods That of Athens was built on a height commanding an ex tensive view across the plain to the Gulf of Phaleron 2Egina and the mountains of Argolis It had a southern aspect and was protected from cold winds by the rocky eminence of the Acropolis The hygienic treatment consisted largely in baths and other hydrotherapeutic measures walking bare foot was also prescribed so that Asklepios may be said to have been a precursor of Father Kneipp Simplicity of diet was enjoined and bodily exercise in the form not only of gymnastics but of riding and hunting was also insisted upon in suitable cases while music and the drama were largely employed as adjuvants Nor was purely medicinal treatment neglected as is clear from the tablet to which Dr Caton refers on which the case of Marcus Julius Apellas is recorded This grateful patient whose statement is interesting as showing that valetudinarians in antiquity were curiously like unto those of the present day testifies that he was suffering from many afflictions not the least being indigestion Asklepios began his course of treatment by advising the patient not to be so nervous about himself At Epidaurus Apellas was ordered a regime of bread and curdled milk and a salad of parsley with lettuce he was to drink lemonade and also honey mixed with milk he was further ordered to take exercise and to rub himself in the bath but was nevertheless to pay the attendant his fee He was directed to use anise and oil for his headache and to gargle with cold water for a swelling in the glands When his cure was accomplished he was told that he must pay his fee and further must draw up an account of his cure Hence we have this record which reads amusingly like one of the testimonials to the marvellous virtues of the remedies offered to a confiding world by the vendors of modern nostrums But in the Asklepieia hygiene diet and medical treatment were always supplemented even when not altogether replaced by faithhealing The patients mind was prepared beforehand for miraculous effects by means excellently adapted to the production of the highest degree of  suggesti bility which the profane describe as gullibility writ FAITHHEALING IN ANCIENT GREECE DR CATONS lectures on the Temples and Ritual of Asklepios at Epidaurus and Athens are interesting in themselves as embodying a skilful reconstruction of one of the most pathetic ruins of antiquity and also as affording a proof that even in these days of crowded scientific life there are still among us some worthy successors of the old race of scholarly physicians who found leisure for other studies in the spacious times when the art of medicine was neither so long nor so absorbing as it is at the present day Dr Caton has clothed the dry bones of archaeology with flesh and has enabled us not only to see in the minds eye the buildings and material en vironment but to understand the inner life and as it were to breathe the spiritual atmosphere of the most celebrated temple of Asklepios the god of healing Medical War NewsSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 1956 Jun 25 1898 pp 1663166420255060 1618 JU1NE 25

busybodies upon it The present Secretary of State for the Colonies has however shown a statesmanlike comprehension of the mani fold factors which make the prosperity of the Empire and this encourages the expectation that he will look favourably upon a scheme likely to be so directly useful in the work of colonisation MEDICAL WAR NEWS RETURN OF THE  SOLACE  FROM KEY WEST THE United States Hospital ship Solace returned to New York on June 5th from Key West bringing 54 men belonging to the various warships who have been invalided either on aecount of illness or from wounds received in the bombard ments in which the vessels have recently been engaged Four of the men were sufferiDg from tuberculosis Four surgeons eight trained nurses and three apothecaries looked after the welfare of the sick and wounded during the trip Ambulances from the Naval Hospital were awaiting the arrival of the vessel to transfer the patients The men have improved very rapidly since leaving the enervating climate of Key West SANITARY DiPWICULTIES OF A CUBAN INVASION A meeting of American and Cuban physicians who have enlisted in the Red Cross Service was recently held to discuss the sanitary problems presented by an invasion of Caba Dr E Nufiez at one time Director of the Hospital of our Mother in Havana presided Dr Juan de Sollossa formerly a surgeon in the Spanish army acted as Spanish Becretary and Dr F B Carpenter was the English Secretary From statements made by Drs Francis Rivera F Marill Julius Carbonnell and C R Gill it appeared that in the Caban war 75 per cent of the Spanish army suffered from endemic disease so per cent from yellow fever about equally divided between mild and serious cases and 25 per cent from malarial fever Dr Sollossa said that before the war 30 per cent of all foreigners suffered from these diseases and the mortality was about io per cent During the war the percent age of deaths in the army from disease alone was more than 25 per cent With improved hygienic measures this death rate could be considerably reduced During the first three months of the year there was little yellow fever in April May June and July more cases occurred though they were not numerous and from the end of August to the middle of November the disease was most prevalent and severe By taking proper precautions those who had good health during the early months could usually escape an attack during the unhealthy months Malarial fever was most prevalent during the rainy season Dr A M Lesser SurgeoninChief of the American Red Cross Society said that diseases were most prevalent near the coast and in large cities Six to twelve miles from the coast at an alti tude of IxoOo feet all persons were comparatively immune The mountains were easy of access and could be used for hospitals as far as the conditions of war permitted In the quartering of soldiers it was especially advisable to avoid the cities and if they were encamped in tents it was essential that the tents should be impervious to the heavy dews It was to be remembered that any person suffering from yellow fever or severe malarial fever would be unfit for duty for at least six or seven weeks so that unless the most careful sani tary precautions were taken only a portion of the army could be counted on for regular duty the rest being under hospital treatment As regards the relative healthfulness of Cuba and Tampa and Key West all the physicians present agreed that the climate of Florida was worse than that of the higher por tions of Cuba and that it would be better to keep the ill and wounded on high ground in Cuba than to remove them to Florida thus subjecting them to the dangers of seasickness in addition to less salubrious conditions on their arrival THE FIELD EQUIPMENT OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT The SurgeonGeneral has issued a Field Supply Table approved by the Secretary for War May gth I898to meet existing army conditions It provides for the use of regi mental surgeons two medicine chests marked No I and No 2 containing a varied selection of drugs many in the form of compressed tablets instruments dressings and books of reference such as Notter and Firths Hygiene Oslers Practice of Medicine Zuckerkandls Operative Surgery Stephen sons Wounds in War and Hares Therapeutics Each private of the hospital corps is provided with a pouch containing aromatic spirit of ammonia firstaid packets with pins scissors jackknife wire gauze for splints bandages and plaster while each man on duty as orderly to a medical officer carries some additional articles such as a pocket case rubber bandage ligatures chloroform and a hypodermic syringe The medical officer is provided with a field case field desk lanterns litters etc The field desk is furnished with stationery blank forms and copies of the army regula tions and Smarts Handbook for the Hospital Corps It is stated that renewals of supplies can be obtained by regi mental surgeons from the surgeons in charge of a brigade or division hospital on a special requisition approved by the chief surgeon and that no receipt is to be given for articles that may be expended On the supply list the names of expendable articles are printed in Roman type those of unexpendable articles in italic The table gives also the provision made for a brigade or division hospital including medicines antiseptics and disinfectants hospital stores stationery surgical instru ments appliances and dressings furniture bedding and clothing and miscellaneous articles with surgical chests Nos I and 2 a case containing an Arnolds steriliser and a Berkefeld filter a field operating case a mess chest a food chest a commode chest and a set of iolding field furniture MEDICAL AID IN A MODERN NAVAL BATTLE In the Medical News of June iith Dr Raymond Spear assistantsurgeon USN of the New York gives an interest ing account of medical aid during an action at sea in the present war When  general quarters  is sounded the sick bay is immediately converted into an operating room an operating table is placed in the centre the ordinary instru ments for amputating limbs are arranged in trays and im mediately disinfected by steam aseptic dressings are laid out and antiseptic solutions prepared for immediate use In former times during an action the doctors remained in the sick bay and the wounded were brought to them but con ditions have changed and now on a ship like the New York where there is practically no protected place during an action this is impossible The greatest loss of life in battle is from loss of blood Some authorities estimate the loss of life from haemorrhage alone as 75 per cent of the total The following is Dr Spears description of the method to be adopted The crew of each gun receives linstruction in first aid to the wounded by the medical officers Each gun has its own outfit of rubber tubing and packages of aseptic dressings The men are instructed how to apply the rubber tubing to the limbs in order to arrest hemorrhage how to apply aseptic dressings being especially cautioned against touching wounds and finally how to support limbs when broken and how to carry the wounded and where to place them Each deck of the New York is divided up into several compartments separated by watertight bulkheads During an action these bulkheads are closed Under these conditions the medical officers cannot reach all of the wounded if they are in different compartments therefore if a man be injured sufficiently to be disabled he is attended to by some of his companions If an extremity be badly injured a piece of rubber tubing is applied so as to arrest hssmorrhage an aseptic dressing is applied the leg is bound to the other one for support or the arm is bound to the body if tractured the man is placed in a hammock and dragged to the best protected place near by where he will not be in the way and here he waits for the surgeon The wounded are placed athwart ships if possible thus offering the smallest possible target for the shells that comethrough the ships sie The doctors take their stations in the most protected parts of the ship namely behind the turrets and here establish dressing stations and attend to all the wounded in the immediate vicinity The surgeons have received orders to expose themselves as little as possible during action as their real work begins when the light is over Each surgeon earries a haversack in which are pieces of rubber tubing for controlling hnmor rhaesfromtheextremitieshsemostaticsapocketcasehypodermi syringe and solutions of strychnine and morphine readyfor hypodermic use and some firstaid packages Stationed with each doctor is a nurse who carries in a knapsack surgical dressings antiseptic solutions whisky etc When the action is over the surgeons will take a hasty survey ot the 1664  JT zn7 I AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOOITION JUNE 25 1W wounded and give such attention as is absolutely necessary to each When the wounded have been attended to those cases needing imme diate operation will be looked after three operating tables being estab lished if necessary The wounded will not be disturbed but will await the arrivial of the hospital ship Solace and will then be transferred to her where they will receive medical attention during their transporta tion to the hospitals in Key West THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE fortyninth annual meeting of the American Medical Association was held at Denver Colorado on June 7th 8th 9th ioth There was a large attendance more than IIOO delegates having registered their names on the morning of the first day In the absence of the President SurgeonGeneral Sternberg owing to  imperative official duties the chair was taken at the first general session by First VicePresident Dr JOSEPH M MATHEWS of Louisville Kentucky FIRST GENERAL SESSION Pre8idet8 AddressThe Presidents address was read by Colonel A A WOODHULL of the United States army In it the view was expressed that the day was perhaps not far distant when no reputable physician would be willing to con fess that he did not belong to the American Medical Associa tion anid when no progressive physician could afford to do without the Journal of that body The President went on to say that the medical profession in the United States had suffered more from the ignorance of some of its members who held diplomas from regular schools of medicine than from the attacks of those whom they called irregulars or quacks To maintain their standing in the estimation of the educated classes they must not rely upon their diplomas or upon their membership in medical societies but must show themselves superior in knowledge and in professional resources to the ignorant pretenders and to the graduates of a medical school which was bound in its teachings by an untenable creed There were those who still spoke of  old school physicians  ignorant apparently of the fact that scientific medicine was to a great extent of very recent origin and that all great dis coveries in relation to the etiology prevention and specific treatment of infectious diseases and nearly all the Improved methods and instrumental appliances for clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment had their origin within the ranks of the regular profession If they were to be characterised by any distinctive name the only one applicable would be  the new school of scientific medicine Not that science was complete for they had still many things to learn and many problems which had thus far resisted all efforts at their solution But they had learned how to attack these pro blems and no one any longer expected that they could be solved by the exercise of the reasoning powers and the facile use of the pen The old saying that  the pen is mightier than the sword  was no doubt true in politics but in science the pen was a feeble instrument compared with the test tube the microscope the chemical balance etc Nevertheless he advised wellinformed physicians to make greater use of the pen not for the elucidation of those problems which remained to be solved but for the purpose of calling the attention of the nonmedical portion of the com munity to the recent achievements of scientific medicine Having referred to the injurious consequences of premature and unfounded opinions especially when given by men of prominence  in the profession the President proceeded to call attention to the best method of counteracting such mischief This was undoubtedly by united action on the prt of the more enlightened members of the profession in behalf of truth and progress This assistance they had had in combating the Antivivisection Bill introduced into the United States Senate and vigorously pressed by the members of the Washington Humane Society and their misguided friends throughout the country The result showed that when exercised in a humane cause the influence of the medical profession was a factor which would not be ignored even by the Senate of the United States Dr Sternberg then passed in rapid review the principal discoveries in the etiology of disease in therapeutics and in preventive medi eane made in recent years and concluded by insisting that there was no room for creeds and  pathies  in medicine any maore than in astronomy geology or botany No restriction was placed upon any physician who graduated from the regular schools as to the mode of treatment he should pursue in any given case If he saw fit to prescribe a bread pill or a hundredth trituration of carbo vegetabilis there was no pro fessional rule of ethics to prevent him from doing so But if his patient died from diphtheria because of his failure to administer a proper remedy or if he recklessly infected a wound with dirty fingers or instruments or transferred pathogenic streptococci from a case of phlegmonous ery sipelas to the interior of the uterus of a puerperal woman it would appear that the courts should have something to say as to his fitness to practise medicine REPORT OF THE RUSH MONUMENT COMMITTEE Dr A L GIHON chairman of the Rush Monument Com mittee reported that in spite of the fact that at the last meeting of the Association held in Philadelphia it had been decided that iooooo should be raised for the erection of a fitting monument to Americas great patriot physician he had so far received only 162 or onesixth of i per cent of the amount pledged This sum together with the interest accruing on what was already on hand had made the tota increment 312 and the total amount of the fund 4424 44 cents Colorado and New York then contributed 2ooo each to the fund Pennsylvania signified its willingness to con tribute 2ooo when the contract for the monument had been made Maine added ioo Ohio 336 California Iio and 1ooo more at the time of commencing the actual work of the monument and Indiana reported about 5oo already col lected but desired to do still better before reporting finally These additions counting those given both conditionally and unconditionally brought the total sum to 12460 44 cents FINANCIAL REPORT The report of the Treasurer was read by Dr HENRY P NEw MAN of Chicago who congratulated the Association upon its constantly increasing growth and prosperity The year which closed on January ist I898 added I5oo new members and during the same time the Association had erased from its books the names of only 75 members for nonpayment of sub scriptions The receipts during the time for which he had the honour of being its treasurer had increased from 12685 58 about 2537 in 1894 to 32200 644o in 1897 The balance in hand on January ist I898 was 1409285 about 28I2 with a

Washington authorities that yellow fever lhas broken out in the American force besieging Santiago The correspondent of the Times telegraphing on July I3th says that while there are I4 admitted cases of yellow fever the whole number open to suspicion is nearly IoO Sur geons and experts eonsidered competent have been on the spotl since the army landed but no decisive measures were adopted till General Miles landed Isolated hospitals have now been established and all the prescribed steps have been taken to prevent the spread of the disease but grave anxiety is con fessed General Shafter telegraphs that the refugees from Santiago are starving at El Caney The number given is i8ooo who depend on such rations as can be spared from the none too ample army stores Some are dead and others dying and the condition of the whole is precarious in the extreme Yet these starving wretehes from a feverstricken city were for days allowed to mingle with the American troops and wander about the camps Yellow fever was alleged to exist in Santiago before they left Now a cordon is drawn about El Caney after the misehief is done Immediately on landing in Cuba General Miles ordered Siboney to be burnt for sanitary reasons It is stated that yellow fever stations will be established on some of the quays off Florida to which a special vessel will convey fever patients direct from Santiago THE SICK AND WOUNDED AT SANTIAGO Telegraphing to the American Secretary for War on July 8th General Shafter said  The men are in good spirits and are making themselves more secure every hour The wounds are much less dangerous than similar wounds with the ealibre 45 Among the large number of wounded are few amputations perhaps ten General health of command is good One hundred and fifty cases of fever which runs its course in four or five days but not serious An unofficial account states that the reports of the surgeons on the injuries inflicted during the recent fighting show that the small calibre bullets almost invariably proved fatal in cases of penetration of the abdomen their action being ex plosive Otherwise theywere humane enough the deaths being fewer than if thewounds had been inflicted by larger projectiles A greater proportion of the bullets lodged in the body than could have been expected possibly on account of the poor quality of the powder or through the reduction of the initial velocity by the surrounding thiekets The hospital arrangements for the American army are said to be steadily improving Forty ambulances are now in ser vice and there are many empty tents As the wounded are nearly all at Juragua the headquarters hospital has been cleared in expectation of the next assault The sick list is increasing rapidly and the officers are hoping for a speedy termination of the siege before the troops begin to suffer seriously from the ravages of the elimate The hospital ship IRelzef with a large corps of surgeons and nurses and ample medical stores has arrived at Playa del Este Mrs Porter the wife of President MIcKinleys secretary is one of the nurses THE  MUTILATION CAUJSED BY THE MAUSER RIFLES Admiral Sampson announced after the fight at Guantanamo that the bodies of the marines killed there had been  horribly mutilated by the enemy Naturally this statement caused great indignation in the United States but it was receivedl with reserve by Europeans who knew that Spaniards what ever may be their shortcomings are not savages This scepticism has been fully justified by the report of Surgeolk Van Reypen that the appearance of mutilation was due to the character of the bullets in the Mauser rifles used by the Spanish and by a subsequent report of the Admiral himself in which he admits that a careful investigation has been made and it is reported to me that apparent mutilation was probably due to the effect of short ranges and I withdraw the clharge of mutilation But in the inflammable state of the American mind the Admirals withdrawal will probably not avail to nullify the effect of the unfounded charge and we heartily agree with Dr Frank Donaldson the special war cor I 83 MEDICAL JOUAL LITERARY NOTES JULY J6 898 respondent of the Philadelphia Medical Journal that the careful investigation referred to in Admiral Sampsons later message should have been made before and not after the original accusation TME X RAYS IN NAVAL SURGERY On board the hospital ship Relief a description of wlich was given in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of June i 8th p I620 there are two X ray installations There is also a dark room for photographic work This department is under the charge of Dr William M Gray the plhotograplhic expert of the Sur geonGenerals Library at Washinlgton It is his intention to take a photograplh of the entrance and exit of tlle bullet in all cases of bullet injuries as well as a skiagrapli and to pre serve a complete series of plates for future study Dr Gray has also in his laboratory an electric drill and saw and small lamps for the illumination of cavities etc as well as micro scopes and other necessary instruments for the study of blood bacteria etc THE DANGER OF YELLOW FEVER IN CUBA SurgeonGeneral Sternberg has written as follows to tlle Army and Navy Journal regarding the danlger of yellow fever in Cuba In your issue of April 23rd p 642 the statement is made that General Sternberg  expresses confidence in the excellent sanitary provisions of the military service and does not fear that yellow fever will prove more harmful to the troops tlhan diseases wlhichl are common in the niorthern latitudes etc T have not expressed any such optimistic opinion and regret to say that it is not justified either by my studies relating to yel low fever or by my personal experience History teaches that when a considerable number of unprotected persons are exposed in a yellow feverinfected locality during the months when the disease is most preva lent May ist to November ist in the latitude of Havana an epidemic most infallibly results In the last week of April of last year there were x7 deaths and 7o new cases of yellow fever in the city of Havana Now suppose that we had a similar number of cases at the same season in New Orleans and that 20000 straiigers from the nortlh should go there to spend the summer what would be the result  All past expelience supports the belief that a majority of them would have yellow fever and that from 20 to 40per cent of those taken sick would die This is what I anticipate would happen if we should send an army to occupy Havana or any other infected seaport on the coast of Cuba during the summer months If however these troops could be camped upon high land in the interior and circumstances were such as to enable them to coiimply with all of the extractions of modern sanitary science I am of opinion that our loss from yellow fever would not be serious But in time of war military com mnanders are expected to take their troops to the points occupied by the enemy and a picnic in the interior with frequent changes of camp etc is perhaps not exactly what we may expect I aiml not an alarmist but I believe in looking facts clearly in the face and cannot allow your state inent of my opinion to have currency at suchi an important moment in our countrys history without a protest MILITARY HOSPITALS OF CUBA At the meeting of the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography held in Madrid last Easter Dr A de Larra Cerezo read a paper on the Military Hospitals of the Island of Cuba and particularly of the Hospital Alphonso XIII in Havana during the war which has since been republished in book form In February I895 when the insurrection broke out there were only 2500 beds Hospitals have since been built in every province of the island and in January I898 there was accommodation for 45655 patients There are eleven hospitals containing more than iooo beds each The larger ones are the Royal with 5ooo beds Alfonso XIII with 3000 Manzanillo with 3000 Beneficienza with 2100 Santiago with 2ooo Sancti Spiritus with 2000 Ciego with 1700 Cienfuegos with I450 Remedios with 1400 Holguin with I300 Madera with IIOO All these are said to be well supplied with instruments and medical necessaries of every description and each has also a perfectly equipped laboratory In addition to the ordinary sanitary ambulance corps a service of carriages is provided for the rapid conveyance of the wounded to the base hospitals in Havana Santiago Matanzas Santa Clara Manzanillo Sagua la Grande Trinidad and Cienfuegos Three of the best steamers of the Compania Transatlantica Espafiola the Alicante the Montserrat and the San Ignaoio Loyola were especially fitted up as hospital ships and contain four large wards of 96 beds each four small isolation wards and surgical wards for operations The ships are lighted all over with electricity To insure a supply of fresh air the port holes are kept open when weather permits and there are as well a number of large air pumps Each vessel carries a large quantity of drugs baths are also provided while for the con valeseelnt there is a large and comfortably furnished saloon On the three ships accommodation is found for I500 patients During the first two years after the erection of the hospital of Alfonso XIII 8oooo patierts were admitted into its wards and more than a thousand operations were performed In 1897 the third year of its existenee fewer patients were treated and at the same time the rate of inortality decreased This diminished deathrate is ascribed to increased hospital space for each patient whieh is secured by the early removal of convaleseents to the annexe and hospital ships The number of sick from March to December i895 was 49485 with 3200 deaths In I896 the number of sicek was 23274 with I06io deaths from January to June 1897 there were 201247 with 369I deatlhs Yellow fever headed the list of diseases The wounded admitted to hospitals during the period aforesaid numbered I I912 distributed according to year as follows 1895 I189 I896 7270 I897 2643 The number of deaths was 523 The total mortality counting both sick and wounded from March I895 to June I897 was 22497 The total number of deaths among medical officers in the hospital service of the army and navy since the beginning of the rebellion has been 50 of which number more than two thirds have been the victims of yellow fever LITERARY NOTES WE are pleased to note that Dr Beattie Croziers Civil List pension of 5o has been increased to ioo in order to enable him to complete his great work

have a sym pathetic exponent in Dr Lamming Burton Dr G Sims Woodheads paper entitled Experiments on Living Animals reprinted from the Medical Ma azine is written in a frank and manly spirit and is one oi7 the best replies to the antivivisectors that we have read He says that in the many experiments whieh he has seen performed he has met at most only two experimenters who have not taken every possible precaution to minimise not pain merely but even discomfort to the animal under experiment He adds that  it is deemed essential that an animal should be spared all unnecessary pain not from fear of the legal conse quences but on purely moral and ethical grounds He gives some striking proofs of the much lower degree of sensitiveness to pain possessed by animals even so high in the scale as the horse and dog as compared with human beings He gives the following remarkable illustration of the inconsistencies to which the antiscientifie bias may lead its victims One wellknowni lady who is supposed to hold strong views against vivisectors is said to have remarked or even written tllat the sacrifice of many women for the sake of gratifying and developing the genius of one man like Byron was more than justifiable and that women so sacri ficed should feel honoured Wlhatever one may think of such liysterical balderdash one is scarcely prepared to find the same lady argiiing that man has no riglht to subject animals to pain or discomfort under any cir cumstances whatever According to a writer in a recent number of Appletons Popular Science Monthly the eustom of trephininc was much practised in prehistoric times as the skulls of these remote periods show and is still in vogue among some peoples Among these are the people of the Berber stock in the Djebel AurPs and the Djebel Chechar of the edges of the Algerian plateau The method of performing tIme operation is care fully described by Drs H Malbot and R Verneau The former was shown by a native doctor a skull with more than a dozen circular holes two slits and a large irregular orifice all of which had been made when the man was alive The skull was kept hidden and was

that a telegram from Santiago de Cuba states that 0oo men in General Shafters army are suffering from yellow fever General Shafter himself however telegraphed to Washington on the same date that the health of the troops is remarkably good there being fewer than I5o men on the sick list News has come from Monte Video that at the request of the Spanish Government a quantity of Dr Sanarellis serum against yellow fever has been sent to Cuba A PERMANENT NAVAL HOSPITAL CORPS Senator Hale recently reported a Bill providing for the organisation of a hospital corps for the navy which has already passed the house The Naval Committee recom mends favourable action on the measure but proposes to amend it by striking out the provision disbanding the corps at the expiration of the present war thus making the corps permanent RECORDS OF SICK AND WOUNDED IN TIME OF WAR The Act of the United States Congress approved April 22nd1 1898 authorising the organisation of the volunteer army requires all regimental and other medical officers serving with volunteertroops in the field or elsewhere to keep a daily record of all soldiers reported sick or wounded as shown by the morning calls or reports which records at the disband ment of the organisations will be filed in the record and pen sion division of the War Department To permit of this ulti mate disposition of the medical records of the volunteers without interfering with the medical histories of men belong ing to the regular army medical officers who may have under their care patients belonging to both organisations will have to keep a separate set of records for each organisation The SurgeonGeneral of the army has therefore called upon the surgeons in charge of general hospitals to have separate registers of patients and monthly reports of sick and wounded made for regular and volunteer troops Similar instructions have been issued to surgeons in charge of hospitals in the field in which regulars and volunteers are likely to be treated side by side In time of peace monthly reports of sick and wounded are required to be forwarded in duplicate one copy to the Chief Surgeon and the other direct to the Surgeon General but during the war only one copy is called for to be forwarded from general hospitals direct to the Surgeon General and from field hospitals to the SurgeonGeneral through chief surgeons MEDICAL ATTENDANCE ON SOLDIERS FAMILIES According to the Toledo Medical and Surgical Reporter for June at a recent meeting of the Toledo Medical Association a resolution was passed onfering to the General Citizens Relief Committee the free services of medical practitioners to such families of soldiers as they may recommend as being in need of gratuitous medical attention BAKING OF BREAD IN THE FIELD The special correspondent of the Medical Newvs June I Ith at Tampa Captain and AssistantSurgeon H T Raymond gives an interesting account of the baking of bread in the field with the portable ovens described in the Manual for Army Cook8 issued by the United States War Department Brigade Commissary First Lieutenant Arthur Johnson 17th Infantry finding thathis regiment was taxed IOO lbs of bread for thebak ing of I96 lbs of flour by a civilian baker purchased two small portable ovens of a capacity of 96 loaves each andsufficient when worked by two soldiers to supply a regiment with its bread ration These ovens were manufactured at Tampa at 24 hours notice and were readily  set up underground in the field The following is the description of the ovens and the method of using them as given in the Manual referred to The body of each oven is made of two pieces of A inch sheet iron sheet steel These sheets are 3 feet long by 2 feet 6 inches wide and so curved tiat when their upper edges are connected and the lower edges fixed in e ground they form an arch the span of which is 3 feet 9 inches and the rise I foot 4 inches The lower edge of each sheet is bent outwards into a flange so as to secure a flrm rest on the ground On the inside of each sheet are riveted three longitudinal bars I inch wide and h iiAh thick and on the outside five transverse ribs It inch wide by 1 in thick The upper ends of the transverse ribs on one of the sheets are formed into hooks and those other sheets into eyes by means of which the sheets are securely attached to each other along the ridge of the oven when erected The front of the oven is closed by a sheet iron or steel door with a handle When the soil is of clay or of other favourable quality the rear end of the oven may be closed by the natural earth but if it is sandy or loose a sheetiron plate will be required to close it No chimney is necessary When set up the whole excepting the door is covered with a mass of earth 8 inches in thickness The depth of the earth is named for the reason that a larger quantity would be liable from its weight to bend the iron when heated and a smaller quantity would allow too much heat to escape An excavation 3 or 4 feet in depth should be made a foot or two from the dodr for the convenience of the baker Two hours are required for heating the oven at first starting but for each heating immediately followingf one hour will be sufficient A small quantity of wood is placed in the oven at the extreme rear and igmted the door being kept open to afford a draught and a vent for the smoke Small quantities of wood shouid then be added as combustion progresses In this was the fuel will burn more freelyand the oven be heated quickerthan if all the fuel necessary for the heating were put in at once As soon as the oven is at a white heat the ashes should be raked out the floor swept clean or the sheetiron floor put in and the dough in pans introduced The time required for each baking is about fortyfive minutes The oven can be erected and prepared for use in fifteen minutes and if kept in con stant opemtion for twentyfour hours can bake sufficient bread for Iooo men By the use of two of these ovens therefore a regiment of Iooo men if it make a halt of fourteen hours hours each day can be supplied with fresh bread daily on the line of march Ordinary kneading troughs can be made and placed on trestles or they may be fixed on the ground and trenches excavated near them for the kneaders to stand in Compressed yeast may be used under ordinary circum stances but it should be kept on ice The rising with this yeast will take from four to six hours It is more practicable however for troops going into Cuba to make use of a dry yeast yeast foam yeast powder that is guaranteed not to deteriorate for three months from time of manufacture The rising process with the dry yeast will consume eight or ten hours A hospital tent should be allowed for a bakery and two men from the fighting force can well be spared as baiers LITERARY NOTES ONE of the first books

300 Among the sufferers is General Duffield The type of the disease is mild and few new cases occur There are very few cases in Santiago itself The total number of 4eaths up to July i8th is given as I2 According to information from Spanish sources the total Spanish force in Guantanamo and Caimanera numbers 5000 men Only about 3000 however are fit for service yellow fever being rife among them ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE RED CIROSS The New York Medical Record referring to reports which have been current in the yellow papers as to Spanish troops attacking Cuban hospitals and butchering doctors nurses and patients says that for a long time these reports were thought to be inventVions devised in order to arouse sym pathy for the Cubans Now however our contemporary adds any lingering doubts as to the truth of these stories and of the Spanish nations responsibility have been dispelled by the action of the Spaniards in shooting deliberately upon the American wounded and their bearers at the battle of Santiago de Cuba All accounts bf the battle it says agree in stating that the Spaniards paid no respect whatever to the Red Cross flag when flying on the American side On the other hand they made no scruple of flying the flag over some of their own most exposed blockhouses in order to protect them from attack One of their batteries it is said was masked by a blockhouse over which the Red Cross flag was flying and the road leading from General Shafters quarters on the Rio Sevilla to the front had for two days been infested at various points by sharpshooters who fired deliberately upon the American wounded A correspondent of the Sun states that while he was crossing a stream leading a mule bearing a wounded rough rider five shots were fired at them The mule was killed and Dr Danford a surgeon in the cavalry and at one time a surgeon underthe Cuban Government was mortally wounded by a bullet passing through his head A few moments later two other wounded men were shot at the same cTossing According to another correspondent one of the most horrible features of the war is the dozens of men who have been killed as they lay in litters and the surgeons alDthough wearing the emblem of the Red Cross Society on their arms have been the special object of attack Seven Spanish soldiers who are believed to have been in the band of sharpshooters who fired upon the American ambu lances at Santiago and killed Drs Danford and Troval have been taken and it is probable that they will be hanged In regard to these charges of deliberate firing on surgeons and bearer parties it would be weLI not to accept them unreservedly without conclusive evidence Such charges were made by both sides in the FrancoGerman War and indeed in every war since the Geneva Convention was made War as a great American general is reported to have told the cadets at West Point is not  all glory but  all hell and individual acts of savagery are sure to be committed even when it is conducted on the most humane principles REPORTED YELLOw FEVER IN KEY WEST According to the Medical Record there have been two cases of illness recently at Key West which it is suspected may have been of yellow fever One of the patients was a sailor on the Yankee who was removed to thehospital for treatment of appendioitis While recovering from the ordinary troubles he was taken seriously ill and died in two days The other case was in the person of one of the attendants at the Marine Hospital and the question concerning the nature of his ill ness was still undecided when he recovered TEmPORARY HosPITALS It is reported that the American Government will establish at Old Point a general hospital where the siek and wounded soldiers will be brought from Cuba for treatment Tents will be pitched at Fort Monroe and every provision will be made for the comfort of the sufferers Twenty surgeons have been secured forservice in the hospital Mr James Armstrong of New York has offered the Red Cross Societythe use of his country house at CentreHill Florida as a hospital The house has twenty largeI rooms and is built on the higheit point of land in the State about seventy miles from Tampa It is surrounded by 300 acres of land and there is an icemaking plant near by Mr Henry M Flagler has presented to the Red Cross a site for a hospital at Miami Floridaand has promised to have the first pavilion ready for occupancy within a week and to con struct a second as soon as possible The use of the hospital ivith a full Istaff of physicians and nurses will be offered to the Secretaryof War by the Red Cross Society A HOSPITAL TRAIN The Southern hospital train to be run when necessity arises from Tampa to  northern points consists of two dining cars ten sleepers and a baggage car The sleepers will accommodate 500 men if necessary One car is arranged as an operating room The train will be kept at Tampa for the present as a stationary hospital for the sick and wounded but will be ready at an hours notice to start north whenever it is thought best to remove the patients to a cooler climate The Daughters of the American Revolution will keep the hospital train supplied with delicacies for the sick HOSPITAL SHIPS Bids are now being received by the purchasing agents of the Charleston navy yard for the furnishings of new hospital ships which are to be fitted out there RED CROSs NURSES TO THE FRONT The Red Cross Auxiliary Committee has suggested the sending of ioo nurses and assistants as near to the scene of hostilities as may be practicable to the end that they may be accessible for service with the least possible delay and the Relief Committee announces that it is prepared to undertake the entire expense of transportation from New York to Tampa and to such other places as it may be deemed necessary to send these nurses and their maintenance while in the field and until their return to New York Fifteen nurses left New York on July 2nd for Cuba and I I nurses 2 physicians and 2 students on July 4th Preparations are also being com pleted to gend a ship to the Philippines with relief stores for the suffering which reports recently received declare to exist there REGIMENTAL BANDS AS AN AMBULANCE CORPS The AssistantAdjutantGeneral of the United States forces has issued orders to the following effect that all members of regimental bands will be instructed in hospital drill and as much of first aid to the injured as is practicable under existing circumstances To this end all musicians will here after report to a medical officer attached to the regiment to which the band belongs for one hour each day for instructions until they are pronounced qualified by the medical officer who instructs them This arrangement will add largely to the numerical force and efficiency of firstaid bearers upon the battlefield Practically the instruction that band members are receiving consists of exercises in the manual of the litter namely marchings with the litter as litter squads composing a detachment so as to mobilise at a given point searching for the wounded by scattering the several squads under char ge of their respective squad leaders the proper loading of the litters with the wounded and their easy convoy to

their escapethe sooner the betterfrom the surely impending evil which in some form may break out at any time A recent issue of the Daily Graphic contains a striking sketch of the method adopted by the Japanese of disposing of the slain after a battle The bodies of the dead are placed in light cases and are cremated in a large fire kindled for the purpose It would appear from this that the Japanese have acquired from their European instructors in military organisation and tactics wise sanitary ideas as to the best methods of disposing of their dead It would pro bably be generally admitted by sanitarians that however religious belief or other motive may influence the disposal of the dead during a pestilence or after a great action th safest method is by cremation if it can be properly carried out In 1871 the battlefields of the FrancoPrussian war brought this question into prominence The French Govern ment was then urged to apply cremation to bodies dead on battlefields but it would not appear that this has been sub sequently adopted toany extent in recent wars Cremation however as a popular method of disposing of the dead would seem to be gaining ground slowly Gotha was the first European Government that authorised the practice In most European countries it is under certain restrictions tolerated rather than encouraged and whilst the conditions exist for burial under due sanitary precautions there is abso lutely no necessity from that point of view for cremation but for the slain after a great battle in crowded populations and great cities in any locality where pestilence may prevail and where the number of dead may be much in excess of the earths space that would be available for the disposal of disintegrating bodies there cannot be a doubt that crema tion properly carried out would be a most effective sanitary proceeding and its adoption worthy of due consideration I It is not surprising viewing the advanced

February on the War between China and Japan points out that in reference to the sanitary conditions of the mass of human beings now assembling round Pekin  a medical question of the greatest general interest heeds to be answered It is within what time after the warm moist weather sets in ought we to expect actual illness to follow upon the hopeless sanitary neglect of vast disorderly congregations of men with many neglected animals col lected around that city   It appears that in anticipation of an assault on Pekin by the Japanese the Chinese are collecting round that city half a million of men who have next to ho discipline or organisation and hardly any knowledge of what these words mean whilst everywhere they show vby their filthy habits that they have not the faintest idea of the most ordinary military or sanitary precautions He surmises that so long as the dry cold weather lasts no danger will ensue from the gathering of this host about Pekin but he pertinently asks what will happen when the snow which has been fouled by hundreds of thousands of men and ani mals melts in the spring P And he concludes that as soon as the warm moist weather sets in the consequence must be a frightful outbreak of pestilence of a malignant type The geographical position of Pekin situated in a sandy alluvial plain in 40 N latitude places it as it were on the boundary line of subtropical disease The extremes of climate are great 0 F to 104 F the mean annual tempera ture is 52 F  the mean winter range is 12 below freezing The rainfall which occurs chiefly in July and August is less than 16 inches These physical and climatic conditions so far warrant the anticipation that disease both of the tropical and temperate zone characters may be expected  and con sidering the ignorance of and disbelief in the efficacy of sanitary precautions intensified by naturally filthy habits impure drinking water and squalor of living the demoralisa tion of defeat the crowding of vast numbers of men in in sanitary dwellings and the absence of discipline and moral control it may well happen that diseases such as fevers dysentery diarrhoea

judge it seems to be done decently and with due respect to the dead Much might be said no doubt from the sentimental aspect of the question But it must be remembered however the process is brought about that the body has to be resolved into its original elements and obviously if the number of dead be excessive it is desirable that this process should be effected with the least danger to the living Dr Parkes pointed out that neither affection nor religion can be outraged by any method of disposal of the dead which is done with the proper solemnity and respect to the bodythe earthly dwelling place of the departed The question is one to be considered entirely from a sanitary point of view With respect to the common methods of disposing of the dead after battlesburying them in trenches often but too shallow so tainting the air soil and subsoil water it is to be remembered that the results of this method might continue for years to be a source of disease Whilst it is quite admitted that a body placed at a certain depth below the soil in proper and suitable earth is gradually disintegrated and resolved into its constituents this is not the case where numbers are crowded together in insufficient space in soil perhaps not suited to the purpose The only doubt with reference to the cremation of the dead on the battlefield would be whence the necessary amount of fuel would be forthcoming  but of course given a sufficiency of that so as to ensure complete cremation no better sanitary method of disposing of the dead could be found Whatever sentiment may say upon the subject the result is the same ultimately whether it take place in a few hours under the influence of heat or whether it take place in a few years under the influence of natural processesthe resolution of the body into its constituent elements We are therefore inclined to commend the proceedings of the Japanese always assuming that the process is completely and thoroughly effected and to express a conviction that other nations would do well to follow their example in times of war or pestilence whatever may be their custom of disposing of the dead under ordinary conditions GENERAL PARALYSIS The old proverbIt is the pace that killsfinds nowhere a more striking illustration than in this disease which under the hurry anxiety and excitement of modern life is be coming more and more common For some unexplained reason the affection is more common in this country than in many others and is comparatively speaking infrequent in Scotland This has been explained by Northern patriots as another illustration of the harmlessness of whisky as com pared with beer a fallacious argument for the onset of general paralysis may have been preceded by no excesses and given other factors may occur in total abstainers But while much with regard to the etiology remains obscure one factor is almost always to be traced namely hard work under conditions of excitement and responsibility Among the educated classes it is men and occasion ally women in the prime of life whose careers are arrested at the point when success is almost in their grasp Among skilled artisans too it is often the industrious earnest man who is singled outthe man who is always anxious about the quality of his work and will work all night if allowed to finish his task And there are many though not so large a number as is usually imagined in whom previous excess appears to have caused the onset of symptoms  but in many cases this conclusion is due to a confusion between cause and effect since in most cases of general paralysis a certain amount of moral perversion is symptomatic of the early stage of the disease The disease is practically confined to the first half of adult life and those who have stood the strain until they are 50 need have little fear of being attacked by this terrible complaint The name of the disease gives little guidance to the sym ptoms met with and many different clinical groups are classed under the same head One feature unhappily is common to them allthe progressive character of the paralysis and the absence of any hope of recovery medicine being powerless at present to do more than delay the inevi table result In all forms also when the disease is once established there is gradual steady failure of the physical and mental powers of the patient until finally the paralysis becomes complete and death closes the scene There is probably no disease of such gravity in which the onset is more insidious On looking back when the physical weakness etc have become marked and the disease has declared itself symptoms are remembered lasting for years past which by themselves seem trivial and are looked on as mere accentuation of personal peculiarities but which taken together have the gravest significance Restless unwonted activity mental and physical is of frequent occur rence a feeling of superabundant energy for which there appears no adequate relief  often undue irritability which will not brook control or contradiction an unreasonable demand upon the time and indulgence of others  wayward ness fickleness or outbursts of furious passion upon trivial pretexts in those who had previeusly been more selfcon trolled and amiable  a growing change in the disposition and character usually signalised by perversion of some one or more of the moral sentiments a fact of primary import from the medicolegal point of view Such is the descrip tion of the symptoms found grouped in most early cases given some years ago by one of the greatest living authorities1 The occurrence of some of these symptoms separately is common in healthy persons but when several of them occur together and persist a close watch should be kept for any more definite signs These usually occur from the physical side There is no longer the power of executing finely coordinated movements the right hand has lost its cunning tremulousness of the facial muscles of expression becomes prominent and a similar tremulousness affects the muscles of articulation so that the speech can scarcely be distinguished from the thick slurring speech of intoxication for which it is frequently mistaken The subsequent course of the disease varies remarkably in different cases In many there is mental excitement with the development of delusions of grandeur followed ultimately by dementia and the description of this classical form is too well known to require further comment But in a considerable number of cases met with in practice I 1 Bevan Lewis A Textbook of Mental Disease Dr Jameson CBSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 1779 Feb 2 1895

per formed 228 rhinopla8tic operations In 224 of these cases the nose had been criminally mutilated this form of injury from malice jealousy and revenge being peculiar to Ori entals  women are the usual victims A full description was given of the different forms of this injury and of the operative measures applied to each The Indian or forehead flap method was held to be by far the best way of repairing a nose The chief objection to this method is the permanent and unsightly scar on the forehead This however in India is readily screened by some headdress or by a mark of red gum worn as a religious observance on the forehead The Tagliacotian or Italian method was discarded as being irk some to the patient and unsatisfactory in its results The nasal method or repairing the nose from the nasal tissues is applicable in a limited number of cases as when the loss is small and confined only to the tip and adjacent bridge of the nose the septum and columna being almost entire The cheekflap operation is necessitated when the defect of nose is unilateral that is when one alar portion is wanting or when there is some obstacle in forming a foreheadflap Intralaryngeal Tumour SurgeonMajor J Smyth MD related the following case A Brahmin youth aged 18 years who had been almost voice less for about a year presented when examined with the laryngoscope by the author a firmlooking lobulated pale red tumour about the size of the last phalanx between the vocal cords having its origin apparently from the base of the epiglottis below the anterior insertion of the vocal cords This growth was removed by a wire craseur so made that the wire when drawn home retreated quite within the tube and fitted it so closely that any tissue in its grasp was sure to be out clean through About half the tumour was removed at the first operation and the remaining portion after an interval of three weeks The patient was quite well when last seen about two years later There were then no signs of recur rence and the voice though a little hoarse in the morning was usually quite clear Some Difficult Cases of Chloroform Administration Surgeon Arthur Neve FRCSEdin pointed out that for all practical purposes ether is not available as an anaesthetic in India This fact should enable the profession there to re gard the chloroform controversy without bias It is not reason able in his opinion to declare that because chloroform is the only available general anaesthetic in India it is therefore the best in a cool climate Although since 1875 there have been upwards of 6000 administrations of chloroform without a single direct or indirect death in the Kashmir Mission Hospital not a year passed without instances of dangerous symptoms due to one or other of the following causes  1 Primary syncope from fear  2 laryngeal spasm  3 second ary syncope from shock due to insufficient chloroform and also from a proper dose acting on nonoxygenated nerve centres  4 tertiary sometimes secondary syncope con nected with vomiting 5 apncea from a mechanical causes b spasm of the larynx c the toxic action of an overdose relative or absolute on the nervous centres Fabricated Wounds and Injuries Akbar Khan IMS dealing with this subject said injuries were not infrequently fabricated in India for the purpose of simulating an assault in support of a false charge or to avert suspicion These injuries are made by different weapons in different ways but are usually incised wounds Contused fabricated wounds are very rare The selfinflicted incised wounds are in most instances slight and often consist in a series of small superficial cuts They are never found on vital parts and are generally directed from below upwards in the lower part of the body and from above downwards in the upper part Attempts are sometimes made to simulate ecchymosis by applying to the skin the juice of marking nuts or chitta Such applications however usually produce blistering or a vesicular eruption easily distinguished from ecchymosis The author notwithstanding a long and careful study of this subject finds it very puzzling and trying to distinguish a fabricated wound from a genuine one and holds that extreme caution is necessary in giving a decided opinion in a court of justice on this intricate matter The Varieties and Differential Diagnosis of Primary Venereal Sores SurgeonMajor J Carter Battebsby AMS discarding altogether the nomenclature hard and soft as erroneous and misleading would divide all primary venereal sores into three classesone of syphilitic sores the second of non syphilitic and the third of mixed or doubtful in which the ulcer appears first as a nonsyphilitic venereal or socalled  soft sore and after a time develops the characteristics of a true syphilitic lesion The class of syphilitic sores includes besides the hard Hunterian chancre a single circular sac about the size of a sixpence which is soft from the beginning and throughout its entire course The mixed sore which begins as an ordinary nonsyphilitic venereal ulcer and finally becomes indurated and followed by secondary sym ptoms is due in the authors opinion to the existence of a double poison manifesting itself in the one individual con tracted probably at the same time or it may be at different periods  DR JAMESON CB On January 24th Dr L S Jameson CB Administrator of Mashonaland and Matabeleland was entertained at dinner at the Htel Mtropole London by his contemporaries at University College including the medical and surgical staff of the hospital at that time The chair was taken by Mr Christopher Heath at present the Senior Surgeon to the hospital and among those present Wfre Sir J Russell Reynolds Sir John Erichsen Sir John Williams Dr Bastian Dr Gowers Dr Coupland Mr A J Pepper Mr Barker Sir J R Andrew Clark AMS and others to the number alto gether of over 100 The Chairman having given the toast of The Queen which was duly honoured proceeded to propose the health of the guest of the evening He said that the meeting was one of old friends called together to congratulate Dr Jameson on his achievements in South Africa He was not indeed the first medical man who had distinguished himself as an explorer and leader of men for on the same continent Dr Livingstone had preceded him and in the Arctic regions Dr Rae had made important discoveries while in the sphere of pure diplomacy the name of Sir Rutherford Alcock now the senior Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons would be remembered Dr Jamesons life in Africa for the first ten years had been that of a successful medical practitioner and the estimation in which he was held in that capacity was proved by the fact that the Free State Parliament passed a special resolution in order to secure his professional attend ance on Sir Henry Brand probably a unique piece of legisla tion In 1888 he gave up medical practice and went to Bulu wayo where he carried out the difficult and delicate negotia tions with Lobengula for the cession of Mashonaland with complete success Later on at the time of the Boer Trek when there was undoubtedly an intention to force a passage into the Chartered Companys territory Dr Jameson by his tact and powers of conciliation succeeded in averting a con flict He again gave splendid proof of his capacity for organ isation during the preparations for the conduct of the late Matabele war Though the whole responsibility of the expedition rested on his shoulders he found time to visit the wounded and to take part in the performance of certain operations The toast was drunk with enthusiasm Dr Jameson in reply after referring to the gratification which he felt by the presence of so many of his fellow students and his old teachers said that he had rather driftf d out of the profession than deliberately left it In fact it would be truer to say that the duties of the doctor had become merged in those of the administrator He recognised the debt which he owed to the training received while the occupant of various resident posts in University College Hospital Especially during the last two years of his time 282 mJ DEATHS UNDER ANAESTHETICS Feb 2 1895 there when he occupied the position of resident medical officer had he learnt what he considered to be the main elements of success for anyone who attempted to govern or administer  first never to make any promise the fulfilment of which could not be ensured  secondly to believe that ones own opinion was not the only opinion worth considering but to listen to that of others If those two principles were recognised and acted up to it would be good for those who were governed for the man who governed and for those to whom he was responsible After recalling some reminiscences of the time when he was dresser under Mr Buckston Browne as housesurgeon to Sir John Erichsen house physician to Sir Russell Reynolds and the successful competitor of Mr Pepper for the office of housesurgeon under the late Mr Marshall he referred to his recent experiences in Matabeleland  Whatever the country might think he said of the methods of our procedure in Matabeleland I am anxious that the members of the pro fession to which I have the honour to belong should under stand what took place I myself previous to our troubles last year always hoped that the Matabele question would be settled without having recourse to force I knew that Loben gula had always said that he would never fight with the 4 white man and I believed that he had absolute control over his people I therefore believed that we should come through all our difficulties without any conflict I was egotistical enough to think that had 1 been at Pretoria when the trouble began I should have been able to stave off any conflict But I was two hundred miles away and I will give you as short an account as I can of what happened When I arrived I found on both sides of the road the Matabeles carrying off their goods in preparation for a fight But the year before the same thing had happened and I then took up a firm position and settled matters I thought I might do the same thing again It turned out I was wrong As I went up to Victoria and saw the kraals burning in every direction I knew that only two things were possible  either we must abandon two thousand people who would certainly have lost their all including every white man and there would have been such a butchering of Mashonas as had never been heard of before  or we must use forcewe must go to Buluwayo When the war was over after the settlement I went over the whole facts and I heard the same account from everyone I found I was right in regard to the king He never wanted to fight but I was wrong with regard to the nation The head men had entirely the upper hand of the king There were only two people who did not want to fightLobengula himself and one of the Indunas who had paid a visit to England So I wish you to know to night that we adopted the only possible method we could adopt We were driven into the country During the three preceding years we had done everything we possibly could to avoid such a thing as a conflict No one could be more ready than I am to condemn any attempt to bring on a war with these unfortunate races The health of the Secretaries Dr Radcliffe Crocker and Mr Quarry Silcock was given by Dr Poore and ac knowledged by those gentlemen MEDICAL SICKNESS ANNUITY AND LIFE ASSURANCE FRIENDLY SOCIETY The usual quarterly meeting of the Executive and General Committee of this Society was held

Middlesex Hospital on January 3rd was a very muscular man but fat and of alcoholic habits He had been admitted on the previous evening for the removal of suppurating glands in the neck The anaesthetic which was freshly prepared ACE mixture was administered on an ordinary fiannel inhaler The patient struggled most violently and had to be restrained After a litt Je chloroform had been sprinkled on the inhaler the struggling subsided The ACE mixture was then resumed After about two minutes the muscular rigidity became less marked A little later the breathing became shallow and the pupils which had been contracted began to dilate The anaesthetic was discon tinued but the face became paler and the radial pulse coulo not be felt Finally respiration stopped the face later be coming very cyanosed The operation had not been com menced and the anaesthetic had not been given more than five minutes The head was immediately lowered and artifi cial respiration started Hypodermic injections of ether and enemata of brandy were given  hot applications were made to the chest and amyl nitrite held to the nostrils but no signs of animation appeared Artificial respiration was dis continued after an hour At the postmortem examination the right ventricle was found to be very dilated and there was marked fatty infiltration of its wall The left ventricle was also dilated and its wall had undergone some fibrosis The lungs were emphysematous and these organs together with the kidneys brain and spleen were markedly congested LITERARY NOTES We understand

examirned a sample of this pre paration which is made by Messra Wyleys of Coventry It is described as a  nonalkaline antiseptic soap powder which lathers very freely in cold and hard water the active antiseptic substance being thymol and it is suggested that it is specially adapted for the use of medical menw nurses and the travelling public The results of our analysis show that the preparation is a wellmanufactured dry soap powder devoid of free caustic alkali and containing thymol A small percentage of insoluble silicious matter is present and this has no doubt been added for the purpose of enhancing the detergent properties of the powder It is suggested by the makers that the preparation is a convenient one for medical men to carry in their instrument cases The powder is used by placing it on the hands previously wetted and when this is properly done an abundant lather is produced The use of thymol instead of carbolic acid may be regarded as a distinct advantage in many respects as it is a powerful antiseptic and does not affect the skin in the same way as phenol We think that the preparation deserves the attention of the profeesion Alknburys Toilet SoapIt is claimed that this soap which is manufactured by Messrs Allen and Hanburys is a super fatted soap made from pure fats and that it is specially suited for tender and sensitive skins

South Africa to learn that our forward movement has at length begun and has been celebrated by victories under Lord Methuen north of the Orange River and well on the way to Kimberley The main feature of the engagements at Belmont and Enslin was the steady advance of our infantry under a heavy fire until they were actually within bayonet thrust of the enemy This method of charging at close quarters com pletely demoralised the Boers and when adopted has in variably led if not to their actual rout at least to their retreat At the same time the p rice paid for this mode of attack is necessarily dear althouRh looking to the number of men engaged on both sides at Belmont the number of killed and wounded on our side cannot be regarded as exceseive KILLED AND WOUNDED AT BELMONT Lord Methuens returns to date are 4 officers killed and I9 wounded and 55 rank and file killed and 128 wounded In a previous letter when discussing the proportion of killed to wounded I commented on the fact that the latter bore an unusually large proportion to the former unfortunately the same cannot be said of the casualties sustained in the Belmont engagement We must infer that the large number of propor tion of killed in this engagement was due to the close character of the fighting and the short range of the rifle shooting At long ranges it is evident that the wound of the Mauser rifle may frequently be a comparatively trifling affair It is pro bable that even at short ranges the wound inflicted by this bullet in the limb is not a severe one but the chances of shooting men in a vital part are of course increased as the range diminishes and we must infer that the short range of this engangement probably enabled the Boers to take more accurate aim and that the increased mortality was not due to any change in the character of the missile but to the faet that the shooting was of a much more accurate character It will however be of interest to learn whether the Free State Boers DEC 2 18991 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF TEE BOER WAR DAZAL 1557 and especially those fighting in this engagement were all so universally armed with the Mauser rifle as the Boers of the Transvaal I have known the Free State for many years and during my acquaintance down to quite a recent time the majority of the Boers were in the habit of using the Martini Henry It is possible that they used this arm to some extent at Belmont As already stated the MartiniHenry bullet is much more deadly than the Mauser and at close quarters the shooting may easily be quite as accurate The Times corre spondent states that the Boers used some Dumdum bullets From this we are led to suppose that some of the Boers must have been armed with the Lee Metford rifle as it was for that arm that the Dumdum bullet was originally prepared although it is possible that the reference may be to a Mauser bullet prepared on the Dumdum pattern DIsPOSITION OF THE WOUNDED The railway is open to Belmont and the wounded at Belmont both Boer and British have been sent to Orange River and from there to Beaufort West and Capetown Beaufort West is a picturesque town in the heart of the Karroo with a good though small hospital of its own Should a further engagement as is anticipated cccur at Modder river and be followed by the same successful result it is probable that any wounded there may be at that point will be carried forward to Kimberley itself where the accommodation for treating both sick and wounded will be ample and complete Kimberley has an excellent hospital with 3oo beds and is a town containing many buildings which might be used for the reception of wounded if necessary HEALTH OF TROOPS IN NATAL From Natal the information to hand is somewhat confusing but there is no indication of any considerable outbreak of either typhoid or dysentery among our troops While food supplies and water are available for the different garrisons as there is every reason to suppose they will continue to be there is no reason to anticipate any great degree of sickness The climate is a healthy one and unless exceptionally unfavour able conditions arise the health of the troops should remain good and their vigour unimpaired MAFEKING Reports from MafekiDg state that the continued shelter which the garrison are compelled to take in the underground holes together with a short and indifferent water supply are producing a certain amount of dysentery among the garrison This will probably only be of a sporadic character but at the same time it is devoutly to be hoped that this plucky little garrison will be relieved before many days have gone by It is quite possible that the bold policy of striking directly at the heart of the Free State Bloemfontein would more effect ually relieve the various besieged garrisons by necessitating the withdrawal of the enemy surrounding them than would separate expeditions to each garrison in turn Typhoid has not been referred to in any of the despatches made public and there is every reason to hope that it will not prevail to any extent ANTITYPHOID INOCULATION Whatever risk there may be in store from typhoid fever it is to be hoped that it has been minimised by the extensive use of antityphoid inoculation among our troops previous to embarkation or after their arrival in South Africa It is stated that as many as 70 per cent of the troops sent to the seat of war have been inoculated voluntarily This speaks well for the intelligence of the men and the persuasive power of the medical officers  it further shows the confidence which the men feel in the Army Medical Corps and the good relation ship that exists between that branch of the service and the fighting arm The statistics with regard to the efficiency of this prevent ive treatment of typhoid are not entirely conclusive at the same time they are sufficiently encouraging to warrant the further application of the remedy and in any case no evil results appear to follow its application although some days of malaise are usually suffered by the person inoculated There are two features about typhoid fever which render it specially desirable that this remedy should be found efficient for the protection of our soldiers In the first place the average British soldier leaving our shores is of the age most suscept ible to the disease in the second place having lived under more or less perfect sanitary conditions at home he has not been subjected to those immunising influences which an insanitary environment appear to induce It is notorious for instance that the native can tolerate conditions of insani tation with impunity which inevitably produces a high typhoid mortality among Europeans newly introduced to such conditions HOSPITAL SHIPS According to the statement of the DirectorGeneral at the dinner of the British Gynaecological Society the hospital ship Princess of Wales is intended to ply between the Cape and England and that the ship now being fitted by the Com mittee of American Ladies will also be employed in this way and not as floating hospitals to be moored either in Simons Bay or Table Bay They are a most interesting element in the preparations for the campaign and serve to illustrate perhaps as fully as anything could the close touch which is being maintained between the mother country and her eons fighting her battles in the southern hemisphere It is no exaggeration to say that the wounded in the present campaign will be more directly under control from home and infinitely better pro vided with both surgical and medical aid than were our forces at Waterloo The world has never yet had a more striking object lesson in the significance of modern ocean transport facilities than is offered by the whole of the present campaign HORSE SICKNESS One of the worst enemies to be dreaded during the approach ing summer after the Boers and possibly typhoid is what locally goes by the name of  dik kop  black tongue or horse sickness It is said to be allied to anthrax and re sembles Loodiana fever which attacks horses in India The microorganism responsible for it is said to be derived from the soil and the disease is most rife from about November to March Fortunately it is less prevalent on the plains than in the low country or on the coast This sickness occurs at times among horses in the form of an epidemic and kills them wholesale Colonial farmers believe the poison comes down with the dew at night and in the early morning It at any rate seems certain that the attacks are associated with the exposure to the night and early morning mists and horses kept in the stable or even in a  kraal  cattle yard from sundown until the sun is well up and has dried the grass do not contract it Many devices have been used to protect horses while campaigning or travelling in the open During the Zulu war nosebags of flannel were issued to protect horses from the night air to some of the cavalry These were kept on all night and only taken off when the dew had evaporated Very few horses protected in this way were lost during that campaign and it is to be hoped that similar precautions will be adopted with the cavalry in Natal at the present time BOER COMMISSARIAT AND MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS The Germans who left the Boer force in Natal and gave themselves up to the British stated that many of the Boers are starving and although we may venture to doubt that statement it is quite probable that the Boer commissariat is very much disorganised The system of supplies is of the most free and easy description many of the Boers bringing their own waggons and others having little or no pro vision for food Each burgher is a law and as far as may be a larder unto himself There is no systematic distribution of rations which ensures every man getting his share so that it is quite probable that some men have to go very short when the commando has been absent some weeks in the field What cattle are to the kaffir waggons are to the Boer The loss of 64 of these huge land transports each one drawn by i6 bul locks must have been felt very keenly by the Free State Boers at Belmont The Boer medical department is un doubtedly of a very primitive character Both at Ladysmith and at Belmont they appealed for assistance from our com manders in addition to leaving a number of their wounded in our hands At Elandslaagte many of the Boer wounded begged to be taken over by our medical men in preference to being left to their own At Pretoria they are better provided with surgeons but in the field the number of Boer surgeons must be very small On The Liability Of Soldiers To Contract Diseases Of The Circulatory System ContinuedAuthors D CullenSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 1170 Jun 2 1883 pp

principal portion is derived from the nervous layer After the central tube has become separated from the external skin the two layers forming it fuse to gether but there is little doubt that at a later period the epidermic layer separates itself again as the central epithelium of the nervous system Both the nervous and epidermic strata have a share in forming the general epiblast and though eventually they par tially form together yet the horny layer of the adult epidermis where such can be distinguished is probably derived from the epidermic layer of the embryo and the mucous layer of the epidermis from the embryonic mucous layer In the forma tion of the organs of sense the mucous layer is the most active the len9 of the eye and the auditory sac being entirely derived from it tho latter having no external opening The outer layer of epiblast cells becomes ciliated after the close of the seg mentation but the cilia gradually disappear on the formation of the internal gills The cilia cause a close rotatory movement of the embryo within the egg and probably assist in the respiration after it is hatched They are especially developed on the external gills After the disappearance of the segmentationcavity the mesoblast forms according to most authorities a continuous sheet round the ovum underneath the epiblast The first important differentiation in it takes place in the axial dorsal line along which a central end of mesoblast becomes separated from the two lateral sheets to form the notochord After the formation of the notochord the mesoblast may be regarded as consisting of two lateral plates con tinuous ventrally but separated in the middle line dorsally By the division of the dorsal parts of these plates into segments which commences in the region of the neck and then extends back wards the mesoblast of the trunk becomes divided into a vertebral portion cleft into separate somnites and a lateral unsegmented portion The hypoblast is continuous with the yolkcells laterally and in front The definite closing in of the mesenteron by the true hypo blast cells begins in front and behind and takes place last of all in the middle In front this change takes place with greatest rapidity Hie cells of the yolkfloor become continuously differen tiated into hypoblastcells and very soon the whole of the front end becomes completely lined by these hypoblastic cells while the yolk cells become confined to the floor of the middle part The front portion of the mesenteron gives rise to the oesophagus stomach and duodenum Close to its posterior boundary there appears a ventral outgrowth which is the commencement of the hepatic diverticulum The yolk is therefore posthepatic as in vertebrates generally The stomodseum is formed comparatively late by an epiblastic invagination At first the mesenteron communi cates freely with the exterior by the opening of the blasto pore The lips of the blastopore gradually approximate and form a narrow passage on the dorsal side of which the neural tube opens The external opening of this passage finally be comes obliterated and the passage itself is left as a narrow tract leading from the hinder end of the mesenteron into the neural canal It forms the postanal gut and gradually nar rows and finally atrophies At its front border on the ventral side there may be seen a very slight diverticulum of the alimentary tract directed downwards ventrally This becomes longer and meets with an invagination of the skin This invagination is the proctodaeum and an anal perforation ultimately appears at its upper end The differentiation of the hinder end of the praeanal gut takes place in the same way as that of the front end though some what later It gives rise to the cloacal and intestinal part of the alimentary tract From the ventral wall of the cloacal section there grows out the bifid allantle bladder which is probably homo logous with the allantis of higher vertebrates After the differen tiation of the ventral wall of the anterior and posterior ends of the alimentary tract has proceeded so far the yolk only forms a floor for a restricted median region of the alimentary cavity which cor responds to the umbilical canal in the amniota The true hypo blastic epithelium then grows over the outer side of the yolk which then constitutes a true though small and internal yolksac The yolkcells enclosed in this sac become gradually absorbed and the walls of the sac form part of the intestine We are requested to

CIRCULATORY SYSTEM By Deputy SurgeonGeneral D CULLEN MD Continued frm page 999 The examination of the table of diseases shows two obsolete terms carditis and morbus cordiswhich disappeared with the intro duction of the new nomenclature in 1869 The former term was largely used in the returns from India and embraced cases of pal pitation from irritable heart dilatation and hypertrophy Its in accurate use led to criticism in the Madras Statistical Report for 1866 when 127 cases were returned from that command and only 10 from Bengal and 3 from Bombay The 18th Hussars gave 47 cases attributed by the surgeon to the inordinate use of tobacco the men appearin  to be regularly saturated with nicotine The term morbus cordis had an equally wide interpretationembracing both functional and organic ailments thus 10 cases from the Straits Settlements in 1868 had  excited action of the heart accompanied by severe dyspnoea and pain in the cardiac region sometimes fol lowed by syncope Under these now happily obsolete terms will be found 616 admissions 36 deaths and 97 invalided The organic diseases of the heart show 9634 admissions 1230 deaths and 3629 invalided while functional diseases cause 5648 admissions 12 deaths and 689 invalided syncope and palpitation being included in this section The diseases of the aorta present a total of 959 admissions 818 deaths and 167 invalided  diseases of arteries 389 admissions 201 deaths and 137 invalided  diseases of veins 1816 admissions 11 deathsand 1073 invalided while unspecified dis eases of the heart and vessels constitute 1152 admissions 259 deaths and 68 invalided In the first of these fivesections pericarditis shows no very marked annual variation  69 admissions 8 deaths and 5 invalided are the average annual results India has a predominance of ad missions the nome army of deaths and invalids The other diseases of the pericardium are unimportant Endocarditis is a term littlo employed in the returns Disease of the valves has a large significance the greatest for the decade in all respects of admissions deaths and invaliding although in the second quinquennial

circulatory system was 954 in South Africa the deathrate was 112 the stational inva lidingrate 316 and the final invaliding at Netley 374 Valve disease of the heart gave during these five years nearly half the admissions more than half of the deaths and twothirds of the final invaliding in this class In the later war period 187880 the annual ratio of admissions for diseases of the

Woolfryes remarks of the Galeaka Gaika war that palpitation was common amongst the young soldiers  brought on by overexertion and excessive fatigue while  muscu lar rheumatism so common in South Africa did not affect soldiers in the field to any appreciable extent The 99th Regiment which was relieved from active service in Zululand and proceeded to Ber muda carried with it this tendency to palpitation  while in the 88th Regiment at Mauritius cases of valvular disease of the heart occurred attributed to  the hardships and overexertion undergone by that corps while on active service at the Cape of Good Hope Taking the year 1869 which gives the highest number of ad missions deaths and invaliding in the second quinquennial period of the decade on the table it will be found that

evenly distributed throughout the ten years  each quinquennial period giving as compared with other groups of stations a small admissionrate the smallest deathrate and the highest invalidingvrate due to the number of immature recruits dis charged the service under this head Among the troops abroad there is a remarkable diminution in the admissions and deaths with an increase in the invaliding in the second quinquennial period probably due to the mtroduction of the term palpitation in the nomenclature of 1869 The phenomena of dilatation and hypertrophy vary according to which condition predominates and both are frequently associated with palpitation Dr Maclean writing in the report for 1867 of 151 cases of heartdisease under his observation at Netley remarks 82 were

right side of th heart The Cape group India and China show the highest admissionrates troops at sea in the West Indies the Cape and India the highest deathrates  and troops at home the highest invalidingrate In the home returns the annual average is 88 admissions 5 deaths and 41 invalided with no great in equality Its causes apart from valvelesions and obstructions from disease of the great channels have been ably discussed by Mr Myers in his Alexander Prize Essay in which he has fully shown the evils of the mechanical obstruction induced by the soldiers dress and accoutrements in exercising a special influence not at work among civilians Surgeon Dvy has contributed a short essay written in 1877 to elucidate still farther the special con ditions by which mechanical obstruction and excessive strain are induced in the recruit He discusses the effects of the artificial dilatation of the chest in preliminary settingup drill and the sub sequent trainingfour hours a day for six monthsas  certain to lay the foundation of much heartdisease in the army with or with out the present uniform His argumentis that hypertrophy com mences in the drillfield th abnormally distended chest causing shallow respiration an excited action of the right ventricle and irregularity of the cardiac rhythmical movements the diminished expiratory acts disturbing the balance of both pulmonary and syste mic circulations and thereby embarrassing the right side of the heart which is over distended with venous blood the consequence being that when the recruit is made to double dyspnoea becomes apparent excessive strain with corresponding cardiac exhaustion results and in the end hypertrophy of the right ventricle with or without dilatation The impeded respiratory movement is the starting point of the sequence  the training exercises induce exces sive museular pressure on thevenous system and the recruit is thus  the victim of the drillsergeants

Powdered Malt on the Excretion of Urea and Uric Acid The commencement of this set of experiments was somewhat irre gular inasmuch as the excretion of uric acid was not normal in amount when the administration of the maltpowder was com menced and the experiments were somewhat marred by a meeting in close rooms which had its own influence on the excretion The experiments were commenced November 17th 1881 immediately after the last tomato experiments and when the uric acid excretion which had been sent up to 193 grains had gradually decreased to 153 grains Date Urine To Litmus Sp

and the quantity of liquid consumed was about six ounces more ie fifty ounces On the 17th after each meal half a teaspoonful of maltpowder was taken and the diet in all other respects was without variation All day a semiheadache was expe rienced such as would ordinarily be expected with constipated bowels but the bowels continued regular On the 18th the same amount of malt in the same manner as also on the 19th but a meeting was attended on the evening of the 19th No change of diet On the 20th the regular doses of malt were taken and again on the 21st and then its administration was discontinued When the malt administration began the health was perfect The second day an illdefined headache and sense of bodily fulness was expe rienced and this continued more or less throughout the administra tion  the bowels were regular and the exercise and sleep as usual Setting aside the meeting which apparently caused the large in crease of uric acid in the collection of the 20th the effect of the maltpowder seems to have been to increase the urea excretion con siderably and the uric acid also There was no other assignable cause for the excretion continuing so much above the normal than the use of the malt and on the cessation of its use the amount excreted fell The amount of malt used would not itself produce uric acid or urea but the action of its diastase on the food would  convert the cooked starchy material into maltose much more com pletely than would ordinary digestion and this being conveyed to the liver and probably stored as glycogen would increase the liver activity and if the urea be a product of liveraction the increase would be explained These experiments jure perhaps best considered in conjunction with the following Action of

great depression and restlessness with feverishness and this continued on the 20th but in less degree On the 20th eight ounces more water were taken and also on the 21st These experiments with maltpowder and with pepsin are by no  means perfect but they point to an increase of both urea and uric acid caused by the administration  and since the administration j may be presumed to cause increased liveraction because of more perfect digestion and there exists nothing in either malt or pepsin in the doses given sufficient to produce by its presence the increased excretion noted the tendency of these results is to fix the production of both nrea and uric acid on the liver or if we cannot go so far as that we may say that increased liveraction is coincident with in creased excretion of these substances It must be noted that the increased liveraction was caused by increased nutrition ie an in crease of nutritive material must have been carried to that organ although the same diet was continued because the diet was better digested To throw a little more light on the subject in November 1882 with a diet in most respects similar and of great regularity the fol

there is no notable increase of urea Now euonymin is reported to be a pure excitant of the liver and has no other action which has been well studied or which is prominent The elimination of uric acid after increasing is seen to decrease in spite of the continued ad ministration of the drug but it must be remembered that euonymin produces an increased action of the bowels and this would carry off water and doubtless other material which would otherwise pass by the kidneys This looseness began on the 3rd and continued ne cessitating the conclusion of the experiment It has been proved that when th liver is eliminated from the general circulation the secretion of urine is entirely suppressed and only recommences on injecting urea into the general circula tion  hence has been deduced the proposition that the liver is the seat of urea formation Parkes states his belief that urea is largely formed in the liver and that in acute disease the deficiency is in proportion to the amount of liver involved I have not been able to ascertain whether this observation has been continued to the elimination of uric acid though of course if the secretion of urine ceases when the liver is eliminated from the circulation the excre tion of uric acid must cease also The question whether urea and uric acid are converted the one into the other in the animal organism has been often discussed and as often left unproved Parkes remarks uThile the complete destruction of uric acid introduced into the body is quite certainr it is as certain that uric acid or some amount of it produced in the body is not so destroyed but passes off with the urine1 Why should we not suppose that the unknown conditions which in this case pro tect the uric acid may be also protective if uric acid is formed directly from food 1 In other words is the parallel drawn between The Army Medical ServiceSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 1148 Dec 30 1882 pp 1317131825261644 1212 Dec 301882 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURNAL 1317 THE ARMY MEDICAL SERVICE To the branch of the profession engaged in medical practice in the army the year I882 has been by no means an uneventful one In the early part of this period at the beginning of the month of April a change occurred in the direction of the Army Medical Department Sir William Muir KCB who acted as its chief for a year beyond the allotted term of seven years having received the appointment in April I874 was succeeded by SurgeonGeneral Thomas Crawford the present DirectorGeneral It was during the tenure of office of Sit William Muirs predecessor Sir Galbraith Logan that the disruption of the old arrangement of the department into staff and regimental officers and the unification of the medical body into a single corps had occurred  and when Sir Wlilliam Muir took over the Directorship he found the new system established but requiring much still to be done to give it due consistence and to bring it into harmony with the work ing of other parts of the military machine At the time the new system of army medical organisation was introduced the present Director General Dr Crawford held the post of head of the medical branch at the central office in Whitehall Yard  and the views entertained by him at the present time on the subject may be fairly assumed from a recollection of this circumstance It was not without surmounting great difficulties and overcoming very powerful opposition in high quarters that the reformed system of administration as its supporters regarded it was introduced  and Sir Galbraith Logan as its parent had personally to encounter much obloquy which was continued to his successor when it was found he was determined to follow in the same path The influence of the opponents of the new system who reckoned among their numbers not only the majority of the combatant officers of regiments but also many medical officers who preferred the pre viously existing mixed regimental and staff organisation of the depart ment together with a general feeling of dissatisfaction among the medical officers at the derogatory and in many respects unfair manner in which they were treated relatively to officers of other parts of the military service had led for several years to a dearth of candidates for commissions in the army medical ranks The evils which this state of things brought about were frequently commented on in Parliament and at last under pressure of the need for a better supply of aspirants for medical commissions and the representations made by various public bodies among which the British Medical Association took a prominent part the Government felt itself constrained to issue a Royal Warrant removing most of the grievances complained of This concession which emanated from the War Department towards the latter part of the time when Sir William Muir was DirectorGeneral restored contentment in the medical service and there has been no want of candidates for com missions in it since but among the provisions of the new warrant was one which had for its object to defeat any repetition of a similar demon stration on the part of the profession such as had been made before the warrant was granted This was accomplished by partly closing the door of entrance by open competition and substituting for it a power of nominating in the future a proportion of medical officers to commis sions instead On the occasion of the first competitive examination of candidates in the past year 1882 an attempt was made to show that the fact of no surgeons having commissions conferred on them without competition was a breach of the nomination clause of the warrant  and we found it necessary to expose in the JOURNAL the fallacy of these assertions and to indicate the trouble to the authorities as well as dis content in the medical schools of the kingdom which would have in evitably followed such a course had it been adopted It would be out of place in a summary of this kind to refer further to the changes in organisation of the Army Medical Department  but it has been neces sary so far to advert to them inasmuch as during the latter part of the year which has just passed away an agitation has arisen backed by very powerful supporters for a return to the old system of departmental administration in consequence of the breakdown as it is alleged of the existing system during the late campaign in Egypt On this subject some remark3 will be made presently About the month of May 1882 accusations of inattention and mis conduct on the part of men of the Army Hospital Corps in South Africa during an outbreak of enteric fever which occurred among some of the troops who had been left in occupation after the close of the Boer campaign were freely commented upon in various newspapers The subject was referred to in Committee of Supply on the Army Estimates and an influential opinion was expressed that the short service system did not work well in the Army Hospital Corps A Departmental Committee with Sir Evelyn Wood KCB as the chairman was appointed by the Secretary o State for War to inquire into the occurrences complained of and though no report on the sub ject was published it was understood that the general charges against the men of the corps fell to the ground under the investigation All that could be proved was that there had been faults in some particular individuals but it was at the same time shown that these had been noticed and adequately punished at the time they had occurred Sub sequently the inquiry by this committee was led to assume a wider range and the Secretary for War Mr Childers stated in the House of Commons that the whole question of the organisation of the corps had now been submitted toit for consideration The Committee were still engaged on this question when their proceedings were interrupted by the services of the chairman and some of the members being otherwise required in connection with the arrangements for the approaching campaign in Egypt The Egyptian campaign remarkable in its military aspect for the rapidity with which its objects were accomplished led to severe criticisms on the working of the medical department of the army A general cry was raised that the medical service had  broken down All sorts of charges were made against it Hospitals were said to have been quite destitute of medical comforts operations to have been per formed without the use of chloroform patients left without ordinary attention and invalids on the voyage home to have been halfstarved from not being able to get the kinds of food which were necessary for them None of these accusations so freely uttered could be substan tiated when they were sifted We ourselves undertook a searching inquiry into the subject questioning in considerable detail invalid sol diers and officers as well as hospital orderlies and nurses who had been in Egypt and the result of the investigation was published in the JOURNAL of the 2ISt of October last As there shown sufficient proof was afforded that there was no justification for the allegation that the hospital service had broken down and as to the assertions of there having been a dearth of chloroform medicines medical neces saries and comforts they were simply untrue The Commanderin Chief Sir Garnet Wolseley in his report of September 24th at the termination of the war testified that  the medical departmenit under SurgeonGeneral lIanbury CB had done everything that could pos sibly be done for the care and comfort of the sick and wounded and this official tribute was confirmed by the strong sympathy evinced by the civil members of the profession in the memorable banquet which was given by them to the medical officers of the Egyptian Expedition in London This banquet was attended by all the heads of the pro fession in the metropolis and a large number of eminent provincial practitioners The medical officers of the British service worked under immense difficulties in the expedition The Army Medical Department had provided for the wants of the campaign on an extensive and elaborate scale and especially had despatched a hospital shipthe Calthage equipped with every requisite for a large number of sick and wounded patients But the movements of this vessel were not under the con trol of the medical department and at a time of urgent need she was left behind at Alexandria for reasons with which the medical service had no concern The CommanderinChief had considered it neces sary to keep the change of his base from Alexandria to Ismailia a pro found secret and as soon as he had secured a footing at Ismailia had fouud himself obliged to advance and engage the enemy so that a con siderable number of wounded required immediate care and attention These sudden demands were responded to and the difficulties connected with them overcome in a manner that should call forth admiration considering the circumstances in which the medical officers concerned were placed It is all the more remarkable that the special wants thus created were supplied as well as they were when it is remembered that the medical department has no opportunities afforded to it of gaining in time of peace the experience which alone can make things work smoothly as well as succsssfully in time of war In every other part of the army it is admitied as a matter of course that the actual estab lishments which will have to be employed on active service in the field should be rehearsed from time to time during peace But even when field operations are practised on the largest scale in which they are ever practised in England it is never considered by the military authorities to be necessary for bearer companies field hospitals or other field medical establishments to take part in the practice The more the discussion has been carried on in the public press regarding the alleged failures of the Army Medical Department during the late war the more it has been rendered apparent that the defects in the medical service whatever they may have been have not been due to faults of the medical officers themselves but to the fact that they have no separate and integral organisation of their own as other parts of the military service have Such defects in the service in Egypt as have occurred have been due to the want of autonomy in the depart ment and of control over the transport and other materials which are essential for its even working in war time and the evil results that are inevitable under such conditions when the pressure of war has to x318 7HE BRITISH MEDICAL OURNAL LDec 30 I882 be met have been foretold in the writings of our best military surgeons over and over again As soon as the outcry against the medical de partment broke out some military surgeons were led to advocate a return to the old regimental system of organisation while military officers have been tracing the defects of the medical service to the want of more military control over the hospital establishments  but it is obvious that no change of organisation much less a return to sys tems which are incompatible with modern arrangements can improve matters so long as the only possible method of medical officers gaining experience in field duties practice in time of peace is withheld from the department An official inquiry is again proceeding on the sub ject and it may be hoped that it will lead to the Government and the public becoming impressed with the conviction that it is a false economy not to afford the means which alone can enable the medical depart ment to work as smoothly and efficiently when it is subjected to the strain of war as other departments of the army are enabled to do The Committee which as we have already mentioned was originally constituted under the presidency of Sir Evelyn Wood to inquire into alleged neglects on the part of the Army Hospital Corps in South Africa has been again further expanded and placed under the direc tion of the Earl of MIorley Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State The scope of its inquiries has been enlarged so as to comprehend the whole question of hospital management and nursing in the field as well as the seatransport of sick and wounded It was stated in the House of Commons that the Committee is also to ascertain what defi ciencies if any existed in the field or other hospitals or in the hos pital ships and invalid transports during the Egyptian campaign with a view to future remedy Evidence is in the course of being taken on these subjects and shortly before the last session of Parliament closed it was announced that great efforts would be made to have the report completed by next session The inquiry of this Committee is not merely a medical concern it is rather one that concerns the interests of the whole army as well as the character of the country at large and we trust that a right solution of the important questions under its consideration will shortly be attained The hospital service of the laree Indian contingent which took part in the Egyptian Expedition not only escaped without the animadversion which the sister service of the British forces evoked but met with ex pressions of praise on all sides This happy circumstance was doubt less due to the fact that the experience of continual fieldservice in India had taught what was necessary for efficiency and because a greater liberality in the constitution of the Indian fieldhospital esta blishments as well in the Jersonnzel as in stores and transport had rendered them selfreliant and comparatively independent Each of the Indian fieldhospitals regarded as an unit was complete within itself possessing the means of supplying all its wants and it is not a matter for wonder therefore that they accomplished their work with less friction than other establishments could do which were dependent on a variety of other departments for their working and efficiency One other point connected with the history of military medical events during the past year must be alluided to and we must then close this part of the summary For many years past the question of eftfcting an amalgamation between the home and Indian branches of the mili tary medical service has been under discussion To accomplish this fusion has been manifestly a desirable object ever since the rule of India was transferred from the Honourable East India Company to the Crown  not merely for the purpose of simplification of medical administration in the military forces of India but also in the interests of pecuniary economy The difficulties in the way of bringing about the union for a long time appearsd insuperable owing especially to the rights of the natives guaranteed in the act of transfer to compete for commissions in the Indian Medical Service while they were disqualified for commissions in the British army Some steps towards a coalition have however been gained of late so that during the last war in Afghanistan the British and Indian Army Medical Departments were both together solely directed by one headviz the Principal Medical Officer of the British Forces in India The way towards amalgama tion of the two services has been further cleared of late by a partial separation of the Indian medical department into military and civil branches and on Dr Crawford during whose period of administration in India these changes had occurred becoming DirectorGeneral it was known that efforts would be made to carry out the system which had thus commenced to its legitimate conclusion Shortly before the present DirectorGenerals return to England the Indian Government had sent home its scheme of reorganisation of the medical department on the principle of unification of the British and Indian services The War Office and the Horse Guards were believed to object to many of the articles embodied in this scheme and although the correspondence was carried on confidentially it was generally understood that the dis cussions on the subject were being carried on between the central authorities in England and the Government of India up to the time when the preparations had to be made for the Egyptian campaign The subject of the amalgamation of tbe two services was then allowed to drop for a time but is now we understand on the eve of being resumed and in the interest of India itself as well as in the interest of the officers of a department to whom India owes so much of its present development and prosperity it is to be sincerely hoped that no long time will be allowed to elapse before the questions in dispute are settled and the medical services of that vast country both civil and military placed on a settled and satisfactory basis THE NAVAL IMEDICAL SERVICE THERE has been some reaction in favour of this service from which it may be inferred that the Order in Council of i88o has had beneficial results as there have been more candidates and fewer resig nations after experience of the service Still the active force remains at about 25 per cent under established strength  but as many as have been advertised for have been entered so that the new policy would appear to be to keep down the staff to working necessities Deaths have happened on or from active service to two deputy inspectorsgeneral one fleetsurgeon and one staffsurgeon of whom it may be said that all are losses to the service DeputyInspector General Hill died in charge of AMalta Hospital of chronic dysentery contracted on service in lapan DeputyInspectorGeneral Cotton of hepatic and enteric disease displaying itself when in charge at Ply mouth Hospital FleetSurgeon Dr Anderson in charge of the Marine Infirmary at Walmer and StaffSurgeon Connell in Japan waters The credit of the Medical Department has been well sustained in thc bombardment of Alexandria and on sh9re in Egypt at the ports where the sick and wounded have been received and in the fighting at Kassassin and TelelKebir respectively for which Dr Shaw of the flagship was awarded the decoration of CB without promotion and two junior officers have been raised each a step in rank The manner in which the service in general and especially in the affairs preparatory to the Egyptian expedition has been executed so satisfactorily to the Government that its chiefDr Watt Reidhas received Knighthood of the Order of the Bath from Her Gracious Majesty Amid such general approval and propitious outlook it is to be re gretted that dissatisfaction is louclly expressed at the allotment of pen sions that have fallen vacant MILITIA SURGEONS IN January i88i a clause was issued in the Militia Regulations for that year stating that all militia medical officers on the departmental list should be compelled to retire when they reached the age of sixtyfive This clause was at complete variance with the Warrant of 1876 and the several Acts under which militia surgeons held their appoinitments and was as they considered uiltra vires and at variance with all rules of equity and lawdepriving them from no fault of theirs of incomes ranging from ioo to 350 ayear and in many instances leaving them destitute of any means of livelihood Some of the militia surgeons therefore headed by the President of the Militia Surgeons Society issued a circular to all the members and militia surgeons both past and present urging them to cooperate and subscribe funds to bring the matter before the Secretary of State for War and the House of Com mons We are sorry to find that but a very small proportion of the militia surgeons responded many from want of means and others be lieving it was hopeless to expect any redress as they had been re peatedly denied such from previous Secretaries for War IIowever a sufficient sum was subscribed to enable them to submit a case to two eminent Queens Counsel and although their opinion was adverse to presenting a petition of rights they both considered the militia sur geons had good legal and equitable grounds for pensions of six shillings aday as granted by Acts of Parliament extending from George II to Victoria 1876 at which time all these Acts were repealed and the militia were brought under the authority of the Crown  but this was in no way retrospective or took away previous rights The Secretary for War although appealed to by the Chairman of the Parliamentary Bills Committee supported by several members of Par liament having declined to receive any deputation or to allow the case of the militia surgeons to be stated personally to him a petition was prepared numerously signed and presented to the House of Commons about April of this year and was supported by numerous petitions from several of the l censing bodies in the United Kingdom and fromBranches of the British Medical Association The Secretary for War in conse quence of a strong representation made to him by several members of Parliament and by the Chairman of the Parliamentary Bills Committee ArmySurgeons And The Late Battles Against The

licensing bodies to take into consideration the possibility of holding such preliminary scientific examinations as were suggested A proposal made by Mr Macnamara that the Council should re commend the holding of yearly examinations which the student should be required to pass before proceeding with other departments of medical study was rejected the proposer and seconder Dr McClin tock alone voting for it The Council exercised its judicial function in the case of Samuel Levenston a graduate of Medicine of the University of Glasgow who was charged with the circulation in Glasgow and the neighbourhood of pamphlets and handbills of an improper character Dr Levenston appeared in answer to the summons issued and was ably defended by counsel In his examination the fact of the distribution of the docu ments was admitted  but the plea was raised that although such con duct was highly unprofessional and improper it was nevertheless not in the words of the Medical Act  infamous in a professional respect The Council however decided that Levenston had been guilty of such conduct and ordered that his name should be erased from the Medical Register The Report of the Finance Committee showed that the income of the General and Branch Councils in 1880 was 6871 19s and the expenditure 5303 18s the excess of income over expenditure being 1568 is In no previous year during the last seven years has there been so great a surplus  indeed in four of the years there were defi ciencies amounting in 1874 to 878 in 1875 to 820 in 1877 to 649 and in 1878 to 116 whilst the surplus years were 1876 with 374 and 1879 with 961 On the other hand the balancesheet of the Dental Registration Fund showed a less satisfactory state of affairs the income for the year amounting to only 616 7s 3d and the expenditure to 1808 10s 7d leaving a deficiency of 1192 3s 4d to be met from the capital fund and reducing the balance in hand from 10489 at the beginning of the year to 9296 at the end of the year The treasurers calculated that there will probably be an annual future excess of expenditure over income in the matter of Dental Registration amounting to about 800 Some business connected with the Dentists Act was transacted An application by thirty registered dentists that their titles as surgeons should be placed on the Dentists Register was after some debate assented to This determination of the Council is at variance with pre vious proceedings and while much may nodpubtbe said in favour of allowing the more extensivelyeducated dentists to make known the fact that they are also duly qualified surgeons a question may be raised as to the strict legality of the action taken by the Council  A few doubtful cases of registration were considered and dealt with according to their merits The visitation of examinations has been resumed and is being con ducted for the Council by Mr Teale of Leeds Professor Gairdner of Glasgow and Professor Stokes of Dublin No report has been pre sented this year  but it may be expected from the known competency of the writers that in another year much valuable information will be laid before the Council and the profession ARMYSURGEONS AND THE LATE BATTLES AGAINST THE TRANSVAAL BOERS We have received from time to time while the war was in progress reports of the admirable conduct and distinguished bravery of the army medical officers who accompanied the troops in the recent military operations on the Natal frontier against the Transvaal Boers The number of surgeons who lost their lives and of those who were wounded in the various actions that took plac sufficiently testified to the fact that there was no lack of courageous devotion to duty on the part of the officers of the medical service We are gratified in receiving equally satisfactory accounts of the excellent manner in which the hos pitals in front have been conducted and the wounded patients in them attended to A communication recently received from Fort Amiel near Newcastle mentions that there have been very few deaths among the large number of wounded that were brought there from the last action at Majuba Hill as well as from the previous actions in the neighbourhood  while some men suffering from wounds of the severest kind including several gunshot fractures of the thigh and penetrating wounds of the lungs are now making favourable progress toward com plete recovery A leading article purporting to be what may be called a review of the medical campaign during the operations against the Boers has appeared in one of the last numbers that has reached this country of the Natal Witness an influential newspaper published at Pietermaritz burg The article is too long to be repeated  but we are tempted to make a short extract from it not merely on account of the remarks being so creditable as they are to all concerned but because they can not fail to afford satisfaction to many persons in this country who have had relatives or friends among the wounded in the distant colony of Natal by showing how thoroughly their necessities have been looked after both in the field itself and in the hospitals where they have been afterwards placed for care and treatment  If a retrospective contemplation of the war now brought to a close is not wholly a pleasant one says the article in question there is one feature at all events which we can regard with unmixed satisfac tion The treatment of our wounded men on the field and in hospital by our army surgeons would appear by general assent to have never been surpassed At the action of Langes Nek the dressingstation for the wounded had been fixed near to the guns  but as the 58th Regi ment advanced and the men were falling rapidly Drs Ring and McGann moved up behind the advancing column and on its retire ment remained amidst a hail of bullets attending to the wounded The native bearers on this occasionand on this occasion onlyalso did their duty bravely bringing in the wounded on stretchers to the fieldhospital At the final disaster at Majuba Hill the officers of the medical service remained faithful to their duties even unto death Dr Cornish was shot as with a piper of the 92nd Highlanders he was carrying a wounded man on a stretcher that had been abandoned by its bearers Dr Landon always keen for duty in the field and taking a special pride in his Army Hospital Corps met his fate at the final rush of the Boers as with a few of his men he was engaged seeing to the wounded on the ridges The ruling passion strong in death he called Dr Babingtons attention shortly before he expired to the meritorious conduct of his men  and well he might Private Farmer Army Hos pitai Corps with both his arms broken and in splints wandered afcUt that dreadful hill all night aiding the wounded as best he could We hear that Sir Evelyn Wood has recommended this man for a Victoria Gross It is conduct that would certainly commend itself to that gal lant soldier With such deeds to record and the excellent provisin made to meet the demand of about three hundred and fifty grievously wounded menbefore tooreinforcements of medical men and material could arrive from EnglandSurgeonGeneral Holloway has every caus to be proud of his department The strain on it under such excep tional circumstances has doubtless been great but it has been met Dr Holloway wisely availed himself of the liberality of the several societies hurriedly formed at Durban in this city and at Newcastle to succour the wounded  and by them every comfort and luxury not sup plied by Government that kindness could suggest has been freely con tributed THE MILKEPIDEMIC IN ABERDEEN The outbreak of a new disease is always a matter of great importance both for the patient and the physician That a new form of disease has recently appeared in Aberdeen seems quite certain  and that it was connected in some way or other with the milksupply seems also cer tain from a consideration of the following facts Near the town of Aberdeen there is a reformatory school called

these terms   How can I help it  We have been vac cinated together This American eccentricity calls to mind the custom which was very general in the great houses of England during the first part of the century and which consisted in setting aside in order to break the monotony of amusement a day for general purgation Hosts guests and servants all took part Saturday evening was usually fixed for the purpose The physician of the chateau came and left with each one in his chamber a contingent of pills and on the Sunday the whole household were satisfied It was a form of public medication which exactly resembles the present practice in America of social vaccination WAR HOSPITALS Dr Guy in a work upon War in its Sanitary Aspects proceeds to prove as facts especially applicable in the conduct of the present war that extempore hospitals of the rudest kind and even the roughest shelter from the weather that can be found or created are immea surably preferable to the best existing structures adapted at whatever cost to the reception of the sick and wounded He says that in 1758 in consequence of an unprosperous attack made by England on France many sick soldiers were lodged near Newport Isle of Wight in old houses and barns In one close hovel a soldier of the 63rd Regiment just landed from a transport was placed On the third day a malig nant sorethroat carried him off The sheets were changed and another man put in the bed  he died in the same way  and a third man shared his fate Fresh bedding was ordered  the boards were scraped and thoroughly washed with vinegar  and then a fourth soldier was lodged in this hovel and died Purification was resorted to a second time vinegar fumes burnt gunpowder and burnt resins being the purifying agents adopted  but in spite of all this the fifth man lodged there had a narrow escape for his life The place was not used again for seven or eight days after which the sixth man was put in it  he too caught the disease and was saved with difficulty This sad experience was a sharp lesson The necessities of the war required that accommodation in addition to that existing around New port should be provided A temporary shed of deal boards thatched with a coat of new straw sufficiently thick to keep out wind and rain was built at a cost of 40 It was large enough for one hundred and twenty patients Dr Brocklesby the physician in charge thus speaks of its efficacy   Although the hovel was finished in a fashion the most slovenly and apparently inadequate to the end proposed upon trial it was found that notwithstanding much extraordinary cold as well as moisture which the sick there lodged had suffered remark ably fewer died of the same diseases though treated with the same medicines and the same general regimen than died anywhere else  and all the convalescents recovered much sooner than they did in any of the warmer and closer huts and barns hired round Newport where fires and apparently better accommodation of every kind could be pro vided for them A fact so striking must of necessity attain notoriety Mr Adair Inspector of Regimental Infirmaries was in the neighbour hood at the time and observing that the constant influx of fresh air was beneficial in so marked a degree to the men hutted in the forest obtained an order to convert Carisbrooke Castle into a general hospital for the accommodation of four hundred sick There it was thought the patients would progress more favourably than their comrades lodged in the miserable huts of the town or than those upon the wide bare forest near Newport under the  occasional hovel as the extem pore hospital was slightingly designated but that had more import ance than was first conceived for although the castle was more prosperous to the recovery of the patients than the lowroofed houses a proportionally larger number of foresters were recovered and that in a shorter space of time This proved that whatever the injury might be resulting to the men from cold or redundant moisture it was small in comparison to the mischief complicated on the sick by huddling together three or four hundred men under one roof and in outhouses adjoining the castle Two years later Dr Brocklesby had further experience of the utility of extemporised hospitals Putrid fever of a very dangerous class appeared in 1760 amongst the sick of the 30th Regiment at Guildford in Surrey for the treatment of which he erected other hospitals at a cost of 10 each with a result the most satisfac tory Dr Guy tells us that in September 1760 numbers in the regiment last named and others were daily falling sick of putrid pete chial fevers where the infirmaries were overcrowded Dr Brocklesby obtained plenary powers from General Cornwallis to act He selected the driest and most airy spot on a rising ground in a field behind the camp removed as much of the dry sandy soil as he required and near the edge of the excavation drove in upright stakes about six feet high from the surface placing wattles between them and coated the outside with new straw Rafters were laid over and received a thick coating simi lar to that placed on the sides making the hollow spacious and airy overhead and yet quite warm and dry A hospital for forty patients so constructed could not have cost more than 20 Of the patients we are told that although several were admitted suffering from a true petechial jailfever only one or two at most died This happy result was ascribed by Dr Brocklesby more to the benefit of a pure keen air breathed by the patients than to all the medicines they took The nature of the soil permitted the removal when necessary of the whole inner surface of the floors and walls which might be suspected to imbibe any infectious matter proceeding from the patients  and the sand so scraped off was thrown out of doors In 176162 an oppor tunity occurred to Dr Brocklesby to improve on the experience he had gained There was a great amount of sickness in a militia camp at Winchester He dug three pits in the chalk thirtyone feet long nineteen wide and five deep At a foot from the edge of these pits he drove stakes six feet apart His walls and roof were formed of the same materials  the arrangements were completed by the construction of a brick chimney and the fastening of a board along the line of the mens heads For windows and ventilating apertures airholes were made in the thatch to be opened and closed at will  and ingress was made by means of steps cut in the chalk To those three mansions for the sick the fevercases from the close infirmary at Winchester as well as from the camp were removed In less than two weeks the numbers were reduced in the proportion of four to one  the number of sick to the end of the campaign was much fewer than ever be fore and with the exception of three at the most all the men ad mitted were cured The same plan was adopted on the chalky soil of a different encampment a large airy porch being placed before each door A regiment encamped there lost not a man during the whole encampment In some other regiments in which prejudices against the above plan existed several of the sick died Dr Guy concludes by stating that he had recounted these experiences with cheap extem porised hospitals as equally applicable to war and peace and as bear ing directly on one of the most important hygienic questions of the day  and that the facts given were quite in harmony with Sir George Bakers interesting narrative of the outbreak of smallpox at Bland ford when patients in natural smallpox fared better under hedges and dry arches than those who had been inoculated did in their own dwell ings ARMY MEDICAL RETIREMENT Commenting upon the promotion and retirement scheme the Army and Navy Gazette says The inducements to retire are really most liberal We may ask why are not military surgeons treated with equal liberality To allow of combatant officers receiving a more liberal rate of retirement a supplementary estimate of 60000 is re quired Not one of the improvements made in the medical department have cost the Government a penny Within the last few years some 240 medical officers have been absorbed whose duties in addition to the recruiting for the reserve forces have fallen upon those who re main The sum saved by this reduction of establishment in the shape of pay allowances travelling expenses etc can be little short of 8oooo Some portion of this

ASHANTEE WAR FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT Gold Coast December 4th FOR the first time in the history of this Protectorate its affairsmili tary political and socialare being fully ventilated by means of the pens of the many correspondents who have cropped up during the war You have now ordained that its affairs medical and sanitary are to remain no longer dormant but be also unfolded to the general view de die in diem Happily the first scene in this drama of war is about to terminate and with it those horrors which have shocked the sensibili ties of humanitarians Cutting off of heads lopping off of arms and such like interesting performances can no longer be had recourse to within our territory for the enemy are in full retreat to the Prab and before this letter reaches England will have crossed the banks of that now rather celebrated river For more than ten months these savages have been burning enslaving and destroying until once gay villages have been turned into mere refuges for the many beautiful lizards which bask in the sun upon their now roofless walls Everywhere where they have passed have they left their mark and it will be years before the remembrance of the Ashantees will have passed away from the minds of the inhabitants Now that we have an opportunity for doing so it is most interesting to trace the progress of the Ashantee army from Prashu to Yaucomassie where the first general action with the natives took place The remains of the encampments are still to be seen roofless shanties of palm midribs neatly formed together which when covered with leaves afforded shelter from the tropical rain and dews so heavy in this country These little bush dwellings line the path to the Prah every two or three miles showing that their progress must have been most leisurely For a savage nation the Ashantees are adepts in the art of war They march in companies and divisions encamp and hut themselves progress in easy stages send out foragers or slaves for provisions and are perfectly acquainted with the ad vantages of ambushes shouting tomtomming and such other means as act upon the rather sensitive nerves of their hereditary foes Their ambushes are beautifully constructed of leaves and vines in the narrow paths from behind these they have a ready means of retreat Scouts occupy all the paths to their permanent encampments so that it is quite impossible to steal upon them unawares as often proved during the progress of the present expedition The care these people take of their instruments of war the construction of their houses and many other points evident in their domestic history show that although savages in almost every sense of the word they are still not without the pale of our admiration That they are endowed with physical courage is undoubted while the reverse of the picture may be drawn of the Fantees who while finely made men are the most miserable cowards Of the two races the coast tribes are the larger and more muscular As with other cognate races they have evidently become enervated by more intimate contact with Europeans The Ashantee army is made up of two distinct racesAshantees proper and Donkas or slaves these last without guns and perfectly naked do all the menial work of the camperect shelter sheds forage for plantains and carry their masters furniture and belongings A number of these have been captured nearly all in a starving condition and some with every bone standing prominently forward three small cuts upon each cheek denote their nationality These Ashantee slaves appear to be very little above the animal in their ideas and feelings  food is devoured with avidity and the unfortunate wretch who tries in the struggle to con ceal a dainty morsel when discovered is belaboured most unmercifully Appearing to have no animosity towards the white man they all tell the same story of want of powder food disease and death It is an un doubted fact that smallpox dysentery bronchitis and starvation have here been making sad ravages This can be easily understood for they have no idea of vaccination and when one of their number is afflicted with variola he is hutted in the bush and left to die or allowedto roam about amongst them The dearth of proper food and consequent neces sityof falling back upon unripeplantains bananas pineapples pawpaws and the wild or bitter yam are no doubt the principal causes of the dysen teric attacks from which they suffer Exposure to vicissitudes of tem perature and wet drinking of impure surfacewater largely impregnated with albuminous and decaying vegetable matter must also contribute to the production of the disease The odour and nature of the faecal ac cumulations which cover their camps sufficiently indicate the prevalence of this affection amongst them Their sick and wounded they nearly always remove either upon mens backs or in baskets roughly made from the midrib of the palmleavesa not very uncomfortable means of transport All the chiefs and men of influence crossed the Prah with a number of slaves many of these have died during the past eight months One prisoner related that his master crossed with twentyfour and only two remained another on being asked why he deserted replied that  as his master had died during the campaign he was afraid to return to Coomassie as his head would be taken off in order to allow of his at once leaving for the world of spirits to there resume his menial capacity and former servitudea condition of affairs to which he strongly and very naturally objected These Ashantee gentlemen have not forgotten the attractions of female society in their wanderings Amenquachie the generalinchief is credited with no fewer than eight wives who are carefully housed in camp in his own particular quad rangle A chiefs hut may be always known by this peculiar arrange ment of the building  the shelterhuts are better made and face each other in the form of a hollow square Here the palavers are held the voice of the solitary speaker and the round of applause which follows upon his stirring words have been frequently heard from our advanced posts which are close upon those of the enemy A few female slaves have been capturedall as wretched as the men One in rather better condition surrendered herself not long sincea Crepi When asked why she deserted herlord and master she replied Well I was taken as a slave from my own country to Coomassie a year and a half ago enceinte and there delivered of a babyboy Since then no one has admired me so I have left them upon the first opportunity Her goodhumoured face grinned from ear to ear We all naturally laughed at such a pretty speech It is to be hoped the fair dame has regained already her lost love The Ashantees have some peculiar modes of burying their dead Only free men are honoured with burial  the unfortunate slaves are left in the bush  higher chiefs are placed upon elevated biers wrapped up in their clothes and covered with leaves there to remain until decom position and ants clean the bones these last are then collected on the return journey and brought back to Coomassie We have seen several of these in the forest and the odour from them is anything but agreeable An Ashantee warrior is after all a picture to look at  his clothes a loincloth over which are buckled the leather bandalier and bags containing his ammunition a formidable knife stuck in this girdle and a long flint musket with a few amulets complete the tout ensemble of his military furniture Such is the savage soldier who has given us so much trouble and spilled some of our best blood Wellknit lithe active he is perfectly capable of giving us plenty of trouble yet and it is folly to suppose that our march to Coomassie will be a bloodless one The wounded in the coming campaign will not be among the least of its difficulties after we have crossed the Prah Such then are the Ashantees as we have seen them during the past few months You can judge for yourself whether our enemies are to be despised I have thought it best to commence my letter with this brief account of the Ashantee army as much of what I have written must be new to your readers By the latest accounts the enemy were encamped near Faysoo some twentyfour miles from the River Prahslowly and leisurely retreating in three divisions Their rearguard was come up with on the Ist in stant attacked and driven upon the

Association were elected mem bers of the Branch and eight gentlemen were elected mmbers of the Association The British Medical Benevolent lundMr WATKIN WILLIAMS with the permission of the President called the attention of the meet ing to the British Medical Benevolent Fund and very strongly urged its claims CommunicationzsThe following communications were made I Soft Cancer of the KidneyDr RUSSELL presented a large tumour of soft cancer weighing between ten and eleven pounds origin ating in the left kidney and nearly destroying that organ extending to the neighbouring glands which constituted the main mass and occa sioning secondary deposits in the liver and on the pleura The patient was below middle age The history of the tumour did not extend be yond four months The tumour increased with great rapidity pro ducing great oedema of the lower extremity and of the penis Death occurred in three weeks suddenly from effusion in both pleurae doubt less from partial compression of the abdominal vena cava There was entire absence of cachexia specially remarkable considering the rapid growth of the tumour 2 Anencephalous FaetusDr MALINS showed an anencephalous foetus having also a deficiency in the posterior arches of the first three or four dorsal vertebrx It occurred in the practice of Dr Thompson of Kingswinford  its main interest being in the fact that it was the off spring of an idiot girl an unmarried inmate of the workhouse 3 Ovarian TumourMr EBBAGE showed an ovarian tumour re moved after death from a maiden lady aged 85 The chief inconveni ence caused during life was cedema of the extremities The tumour filled the pelvis and was firmly fixed by fibrous bands to the uterus The tumour was in parts of bony hardness It was referred for exa mination to the Pathological Section 4 Fibromta of the UterusMr BARTLEET exhibited a fibroma uteri removed the previous day by the ecraseur Tinted microscopic speci mens of the growth kindly prepared by Dr Malins were placed on the table 5 Mr SAMPSON GAMGEE read notes on Esmarchs Bandages for Bloodless Operations and Mr BOND MOORE a paper on the Con nexion between Sewagepoisoning and Typhoid Fever Each papes was followed by an interesting discussion BIRMINGHAM AND MIDLAND COUNTIES BRANCH MICROSCOPICAL SECTION A MEETING of the Section took place in Queens College Birming ham December gth Dr WADE in the Chair The Optic Nerves and Chiasma Mr PRIESTLEY SMITH read a paper on this subject and referred to recent articles in the Archiv fur Op thalmologie which seemed to establish a total decussation of the optic tracts in the chiasma and also the accepted belief in a semidecussa tion The settling of this great question would be of great importance in connection with hemiopia as a means of localising brainlesion The subvaginal space existing between the inner and outer sheaths of the optic nerve was described in its important relation to the conditions known as  choked disc and staphyloma posticum The paper wae illustrated by diagrams explaining the different theories of the causa tion of hemiopia and by a number of sections of the chiasma and trunk of the optic nerve showing the normal structure and the changes produced by inflammation and atrophy Epiphytic Growths oJ the SkinDr CARTER contributed a paper on this subject illustrated by specimens of tinea tonsurans tinea circi natus and tinea sycosis and gave some instructions also for obtaining Notes Of The WarSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 509 Oct 1

colleagues during and after the battle of Sedan On the Ist September the caserne in which they were was in the direct line of a constant fire carried on by the Germans for six hours The building was bombproof but the shells raked the wards from window to win dow killing one hospitalhelper and severely wounding another Dr MacCormac was constantly employed for several days in operating the operations comprising two cases each of ligature of the subclavian and of the carotid arteries excisions of joints and innumerable amputa tions Attempts at conservative surgery in cases of injury of bones have not been satisfactory even where the injury has at first appeared slight The Prussian bullets splinter bones in everv direction gene rally to such an extent as to demand immediate resection or amputation Up to the i6th the date of the letter there had been no erysipelas hospital gangrene or pyoemia and but one case of secondary haemor rhage after operations This immunity from epidemic disease he ascribes to the copious use of carbolic acid and especially to free ventilation The windows of the rooms were kept wide open at all timesto the great horror of a French intendantgeneral who told Dr MacCormac and his colleagues that they were going to kill their patients with courants of air A DEFENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY MR BERKELEY HILL and Mr Ernest Hart who have been inspecting the ambulances of the British Aid Society in the Sedan district have written to the Daily Telegrajh a letter in which the deny the state ment recently made by a correspondent of that paper that in no single mnilitary ambulance have the amateur medical assistants taken off their coats so to speak and gone to work like men at what they are en gaged to do They complain that the correspondent has mixed up all the ambulancesBritish French Belgian etcin one com mon condemnation They point out that as regards the French sur geons the charge of indifference is not applicable In the French ambulance the very moment that one of us entered the hospital M Tilleaux was performing disarticulation of the arm at the shoulderjoint aided by some of his assistants while others were dressing in the wards The joy with which they received our medical stores taking only what was strictly necessary betokens no want of interest in their work  and having had no inconsiderable experience of hospital work in which we have been engaged all our professional lives we have seen no signs of loafing but on the contrary of earnest and devoted work Of the medical officers in the service of the British Society the writers of the letter say that their conduct has been beyond praise  and they protest against the implication far more the direct statement that those who have enlisted under the British Society are careless or idle They repeat the statement that has been already made that there is a crowd of loafers wearing the red cross but they believe that if their badges were examined not one would be found to bear the stamp of the Bri tish International Society and that the wearers are not directly at tached to the foreign ambulances Messrs Hill and Hart state that they found very general evidences of a want of organisation and of de ficiency in the means of communication and supply between the red cross ambulances of the British and Foreign Societies The real diffi culty for the British Society they write has been in the sudden and mar vellously rapid development of its resources which left little time in deed for the regular organisation of its now gigantic task and in the entire absence of any previous machinery to be used for the pur pose To improvise a large series of ambulances suddenly in a foreign country occupied by combatant forces with all kinds of impediments to traffic and difficulties of transport would have puzzled very wise and experienced heads even where the extent and localities were of neces sity accurately known and the amount of resources was ascertained Moreover the first administrators sent out were inexperienced and many employed are still so The authors of the letter have laid before Captain Brackenbury the chief agent of the British Society here and have written home to Colonel Lindsay some detailed criticisms and suggestions Many of them had been anticipated by Captain Bracken bury who they believe concurs in all On the large scale on which the British Society is now able to work more numerous centres of action must be taken Experienced administrators such as deputy inspectors of the hospitals of the army or navy are wantedone at each centre experienced commissariat officers and an organised intel ligence department All these wants could not be accurately forecast they are on the way to be rapidly fulfilled Meantime thousands have been comforted and saved by the British Society and both France and Germany have cause to bless its name THE GERMAN FIELDHOSPITALS THE following is from a correspondent On the 13th of September an order was issued from Berlin not to esta blish any more new hospitals for the wounded as a great number of beds are empty and the present accommodation appears amply suffi cient How great the available number of beds all over Germany must be can be guessed if we mention that such towns as for instance Frankfort or Mannheim have made up from I200 to 1500 beds each and that even the smallest places would not stand behind but wanted to have a few wounded soldiers to nurse Everywhere the local prac titioners attend them and the nursing is done by trained nurses and sisters of charity assisted by ladies of all ranks The hospitals are mostly temporary wooden buildings socalled barracken of a most simple construction the only aim of wbich is to afford protection from rain and to allow thorough ventilation The place of windows is taken by wooden frames covered with canvas which are opened whenever the weather allows As the cold weather lately prevailing did not admit of their being freely opened they have in some hospitals been replaced by glasswindows to admit more light and thereby to render the ward more cheerful These wards are mostly built entirely of wood in some places however part of the walls is made of bricks They have either no floor but the dry ground or what is much better and carried through in all the richer towns the floor is raised about two feet above the ground and the boards are soaked with oil The roof is well pro jecting and free ventilation is secured by open spaces where the roof rests on the sidewalls as well as on the crown of the roof which is raised two or three feet A number of such wooden houses are arranged either without any system at all simply as the ground at disposal has per mitted or they are placed in rows or more elaborately grouped round the kitchen which is generally the central building The large barrackenlazareth at Frankfort with 600 beds consists quite of a little town of wooden houses in three rows the houses con taining 20 beds each being placed with their lengths at right angles to the road between them At Mannheim they are arranged in the form of a triangle one behind the other and connected one with an other by a covered passage The sides of this triangle are flanked by two large wards of 34 beds each the other wards containing only 22 These larger wards have raised floors and windows The closets are either partitioned off at one end of the ward the same as the scullery or they are altogether outside and projecting from the wards Moules earthclosets are much used at Frankfort but at Mannheim and other places they use barrels with sulphate of iron or zinc and other disinfec tants these barrels are emptied every day There are not many severely wounded at Frankfurt but a great many are to be found at Mannheim and Darmstadt These are the places where good surgery and the most modern appliances for the treatment of compound fractures can be seen At Darmstadt Professor Lucke Oct I 1870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 70URNAL 37 of Bern is at the head of the hospitals assisted by a staff of young Swiss surgeons At Mannheim Professor Bergmann of Dorpat with several Russian surgeons and Dr Lossen of Halle manage the two largest barrackenlazareth whilst Professor Billroth of Vienna acts as con sulting surgeon for the whole of the Mannheim hospitals The work in these hospitals is done with a regularity and order not exceeded by any permanent clinical hospital the staffs of young surgeons being suffi ciently numerous to take temperatures in all severe cases and to make notes of the more interesting ones There were a good many patients that had undergone serious operationsabout halfadozen resections of the head of the humerus several excisions of the elbow a number of amputations several cases in which ligature of an important artery had been made bulletwounds in all possible and apparently impos sible directions narrow escapes from balls having passed through the neck and having just spared the carotid or through the inguinal region without injuring the femoral artery bullets having passed through the knee or anklejoint without setting up suppuration etc Plaster of Paris is most extensively used A very convenient swinging apparatus which is much used in conmpound fractures of the lower extremity consists of a plaster of lParis bandage in which runs a narrow iron splint with three projecting rings for suspension along the front of the leg Pro fessor Volkmann of Halle is the originator of this method and he has also most conveniently modified what is known in England as the Ame rican method of treating fractures of the thigh by simple extension without splints Instead of attaching the string bearing the weight im mediately to the loop of adhesive plaster he interposes a small piece of wood which is placed horizontally and which rests and freely moves on the edges of two triangular blocks of wood lying on a board one at each side of the foot This arrangement makes the extension much more steady Behind the large barrackenlazareth at Mannheim is a tenthos pital containing 32 beds established by the Dutcb Drs Schubart and Brondgeest of Utrecht being the chief surgeons They brought their tents beds nurses and every thing with them The whole has a very cheerful aspect In the Palatinate we had an opportunity to observe the very strict measures which have been taken to stamp out the cattleplague which unfortunately has made its appearance in several places A military cordon is placed round the affected villages all the animals in a stable where a single case has appeared are doomed to destruction the most rigid disinfection of the stable is carried out Small disinfecting huts are established at all the chief roads coming out of a village  and every one leaving the village is bound by a heavy penalty to stay a few minutes in an atmosphere of chlorilne before he is allowed to proceed on his journey We had to undergo this fumigating process twice yesterday afternoon Horses and cattle are disinfected by washing their feet with water containing chloride of lime Cats and dogs are not allowed to be at large It is to be expected that by these strict measures the further spread of the disease will be prevented September 20th 1870 THE GERAIAN AID SOCIETIES OUR correspondent at Berlin writes as follows under date Sept 26th I have now to speak at present about the private societies found every where and having for their purpose either the relief of the sick and wounded or the support of the families of reserve and Land wehr men who have entered the army or the relief of the troops them selves by sending refreshments etc or as most of them fulfilling all these purposes at once For their common interests all the local societies for the relief of the sick and wounded throughout Germany have a Central Committee formed of delegates and stationed in Berlin Unter den Linden I12 This Committee has charge of the intercourse and correspondence with foreign aid societies and gives directions to the local societies in regard of the places where and the manner in which help is wanted Nevertheless the local and provincial socie ties may under direct communication with the Central Committee support the hospitals in their own neighbourhood and their own re spective troops and may independently order materials where they are wanted Besides the local depots of materials clothes bandages medicines food etc there is a Central Depot also at Berlin general depots resorting of it at Coblenz Mainz Mannheim and depending on these special depots at Saarlouis Saarbriicken Weissenburg Hagenau Courcelles Remilly Nancy PontaMousson Sedan and various other places Now and then the Central DepOt publishes lists of the objects sent by them For instance I quote from the last list IOOO trunks with charpie 2000 with plaster of Paris Iioo pounds of carbolic acid 2000 pounds of chloroform 237 pounds of tincture of opium 2000000 of cigars 26oooo bottles of claret The number of beds prepared by private societies existing in all the larger towns of Germany as Leipzig Magdeburg Hanover etc for the reception of sick and wounded is enormous and we are glad to say surpasses everywhere the amount actually necessary so that you may often find in the papers complaints about not yet having received the expected wounded Corresponding to the size and means of the town the largest of these local societies is the  Berlin Aid Society for the German Field Armies By its own means this society established a hospital of four hundred beds in the Uhlans barrack and built on the field of Templehof fourteen barracks for thirty patients each The fur nishment and management in the hospitals are excellent in some points I should think even too luxurious Besides this society there are in Berlin a number of smaller societies formed by private circles or in single parishes and following one or some of the purposes above named In this way there are here more than a dozen of hospitals ad hoc for twenty to fifty patients each The large permanent civil hospitals as the Charite St IHedwigs Hospital St Elizabeth Hospital etc receive also a certain number of military patients I may add that by the military authorities three large caserns and the halls of the Central turnanstadt are arranged as hospitals so they have at their disposal alone together with the garrison hospital and the new wooden bar racks about two thousand beds In the beginning of the war the wounded were sent to the different hospitals without regarding their nationality but byandbye affairs of discipline made it necessary to send the French to the exclusively military hospitals where they might be under a stricter superintendence Though not really belonging to the Aid for the Sick and Wounded I mention in a few words the societies already referred to which sup port the families of reserve and Landwehr men Success has shown what may be done by an army like the German composed of civilians and originating out of every class of society and every calling but proportionally large is the influence of this organisation on home affairs In consequence of the mobilisation many thousands of wives and children are destitute and unable to support themselves alone Hence it is quite necessary to support these families to a certain degree Besides numerous parish committees five large societies have been originated for this purpose to ensure as judicious and correct as pos sible a distribution of their means They have now formed a Central Board under the presidency of Mr Seydel Mayor of Berlin With the beginning of the cold season public opinion thinks about sending refreshments spirits and warm clothes to our troops  innu merable stockings flannelshirts sashes etc are bought by local com mittees and are to be sent in special trains to the different army corps From the beginning of the mobilisation measures were taken by pri vate and by public authorities to refresh the passing troops on the rail way stations large and small towns emulated each other in doing so At Berlin the most extensive arrangements were made on the east station Mrs Lina Morgenstern who has managed for some years the Berlin  Volkskiichen institutions furnishing the workingclasses with good and cheap dinnersin a most excellent way has to the general satisfaction the superintendence of these arrangements Within the last few weeks at the same stations dressingplaces have been made ready for the trains of wounded who pass Berlin and go to more distant hospitals The medical arrangements at the stations are under the charge of a number of Berlin surgeons who have made it their duty to be present when the trains bringing the wounded are announced The cattleplague observed a few weeks since in the Palatinate and supposed to be brought in with the Hungarian cattle has broken out spo radically at different places in Germany Some villages near Berlin are surrounded with a military cordon on account of the outbreak gene rally the strictest measures are taken to avoid a spread of the disease In I866 permanganate of potash was the antiseptic remedy d 1 mode this year it is carbolic acid In every hospital it is used on the largest scale for dressing and washing wounds in more or less strict accordance with the directions of Mr Lister The following is a part of a report from Donchery dated September 17th Four thousand six hundred and seventyseven Germans have been up to this day sent home through Belgium  a few more may be sent in ten days or a fortnight For this purpose Messrs von Stein and vor Tettan will stay in Libramont and Bouillon until the Ist October and will be so able to finish their work there entirely Mr von Albedyll and Count Kleist remain here the latter after breaking up the station at Neufchateau went for a few days only to Libramont Generally the evacuation of the wounded is very difficult from the want of carriages It was in vain tried on our part by the IntendantGeneral and Mr Hubert Salatin to send on the wounded by the railway through Mezieres and Givet The EtappenInspector of the army of the Meuse wished to establish large hospitals at Sedan and to send the patients thence through Belgium but General Boeger thought the air of Sedan and its neighbourhood too unhealthy Notes Of The WarSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No

the wounded at Reichshoffen have arrived at the military hospital of Versailles and more are expectcd The ordinary patients of the hospital have been sent to Alen9on and other places LISTS of the wounided on both sides have hitherto been exchanged between the German and French Aid Committees by way of Geneva An arrangement however has been decided on by which the transmis sion will be direct THE 7ounzal des Conaissances Akldicales Pratiyttes says that in future whenever time allows the wounded will be transported on straw in open luggagewagons instead of as hitherto being shut up in closed compartments THE medical department of the Prussian Mlinistry says the Wietner Afedizin IVochenschrift has sent a large supply of disinfectants as well as of medicines to the districts around Mfetz It is intended when AMetz has surrendlered to send away to distant healthy places the sick and wounded who are shut up there after disinfection has been applied The Prussian medical department has also sent to the army a supply of medicines for diarrhcea which usually prevails at this season of the year The state of the health of the German troops in France continues to be very favourable TIIE JOIHANNIITER CORPS A SPECIAL correspondent of the Daily Teecgqph passes some severe strictures on the J ohanniter Corps which tally in every respect with reports which have come to us from other quarters and they are the opinions of the German people themselves  lhis corps is composedl of gentlemen many of whom have served in the army but the greater number of them are civilians who have undergone their three years regulation service In order to qualify a gentleman to become a jolhanniter he must be able to show fourteen quarters upon his coat of arms and an un blemished descent of many years he is then entitled to wear a white enamelled 1Maltese cross suspended by a green ribbon to his neck and an uniform of the same description as the Prussian infantry except that the buttons have a Maltese cross upon them and the white badge with the red cross is worn upon the left arm Under their care for the purpose of distribution are placed all the medical comfortswine pro visions and beddingthat are sent by individuals or communities for the use of the sick and wounded  and without a special order from them none of these things can be taken even by medical men Now I am not goig to say that all are alike but the conduct ofthese gentlemen for the most part is beneath contempt They live upon the fat of the land they never know what it is to want a meal and they take care it is a good one The medical staff are continually at logerheads with them because they cannot get what has been sent out for the special benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers They are always m the best quar ters and never where they are nted There are however soine noble exceptions THE GENEVA CONVENTION COMPLAINTS of infraction of the Geneva Convention are says the Wienter AMedizin Wovhenchkrsft made by both the belligerent armies The Prussians and the French accuse each other of firing on the dress ingstations and fieldhospitals and of treating the surgeons and their helpers as combatants Such complaints will be constantly heard for notwithstanding the best intentions of rulers and commanders in the field excesses of this kind are not to be restrained in the heat of battle The paragraphs of the Geneva Convention may be unknown to many officers and most subalterns of both armiesnay they may be ignornt of the Convention itself to say nothing of the natural savageness of a heated and raging soldiery In spite of all the blessings of the Con vention have come to light in many points in this terrible contest and having been so far recognised it will certainly attain its proper value LOAFERS UNDER THE RED CROSS A CORRESPONDENT at Berlin writes that communications received from the theatre of war complain of the great crowd following the army under the sign of the Geneva cross only a minority of them are able and willing really to help the rest coming for curiosity and using the shelter and food intended for the sufferers The soldiers have nicknamed such persons  battleloafers The Royal German Commissary for volun tary aid has up to this day distributed cards for more than 12000 persons it is evident that among this number there may be many unfit for the purpose because in the short space of time a careful selection and examination of the competitors was not possible The voluntary aid might perhaps be still more closely connected with and subordinated to the military medical service Similar complaints couched in the warmest terms are made by other correspondents at the seat of war They are in many cases not without truth and one of our special correspondents says that several persons happily not English wearing the Geneva badge have been found robbing the dead and wounded THE WAR HOSPITALS THE following notes have been sent us by Dr J Ford Anderson who has recently returned from a tour through some of the hospitals in the rear of the German armies At AixlaChapelle I first saw the wounded There the existing hospitals being insufficient to accommodate the wounded a large wooden hospital on the pavilion system was in course of erection One wing was completed and its sixty beds were occupied with patients suffering from wounds of every part of the body There was a case of perforation of the windpipe and pharynx The patient declined the use of the stomachpump and he was supported by nourishing enemata In another case a single ball had perforated both thighs and the external genitals In a third case the ball entering the external ear had passed out through the antrum cruslhing in its course forward the temporal and malar bones Most of the wounds however were in the extremities and in many of these cases there was fracture of the bone The patients were all Prussians anid their wounds were caused by the chassepot Througlh the kindness of Dr Brandis I was enabled to see and assist in the treatment of these cases during my short stay The treatment of wounds was by irrigation with a weak solution of Condys fluid followed by a dressing of charpie dipped in carbolised oil and covered with imper meable paper This was done twice daily In cases of fracture the limb was enveloped in plaster of Paris The mode of application was as follows The limb was first bandaged with pressed cottonwool four laths were then laid lengthways along the limb and the whole was bound down with a bandage which was smeared thickly with plaster of Paris The apertures of entrance and exit were left exposed for the purpose of irrigation and for removing portions of bone which were loose The surgery was decidedly conservative Several cases of frac ture in joints were intended for resection At that time three weeks ago Dr Brandis had amputated in one case only As the hospital at AixlaChapelle was not likely to be ready for a fortnight and there was a sufficient number of assistants to do the work there I resolved to go nearer the seat of war On my way through Coblentz and Saarbriick I visited the larger lazarettes Everywhere I 318 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURNAL Sept 171870 found the same conservatism in surgery Resections of the elbow shoulder and knee will be numerous for some weeks to come On the day I visited Saarbriick three of these resections were performed in the tent of the Amsterdam Aid Society I did not find the irrigation treatment of wounds so uiual as I went on Instead of it baths of sheet zinc filled with water were used and in these the wounded limbs were immersed This treatment is less troublesome but appears to make the granulations soft and flabby From Saarbriick I went into France travelling by that slowest of conveyances a militairzug At last how ever I reached Kemilly and Courcelles in time to aid in the dressing and preparation for transport of four or five hundred of the soldiers wounded in the battle at Metz on August 3Ist The wounded were brought down to these stations and laid on straw in sheds All of them had been attended to in some way on the field but here their cases were revised Bad cases are treated in the local hospitals until they can bear being transported to Germany I was much struck with the de sire of the wounded soldiers to be considered by the doctor able to travel homewards The German love for the Fatherland is intense and I saw many a strong man stealthily dash the tears from his eyes when his sentence  Hier bleiben was pronounced And when it is possible the surgeon who has to decide whether the wounded man shall go or stay respects his feelings Apart from sentiment the disappoint ment of remaining and consequent depression must often have a retard ing effect on the recovery Much of the dressing of wounds is done by nonprofessional volun teer helpers of the different Aid Societies German and foreign I have heard of sixty of these societies and probably there are more Their object is to assist in every way the sick and wounded They carry them off the field of battle They give them stores with which they are en trusted They dress their lighter wounds and call a surgeon for the severer wounds and so on Many of them are educated men who leave their professions to do this work The usefulness of these assist ants individually cannot be overestimated But as each society acts in dependently it often happens that helpers are in excess in one place while another place is shorthanded Many of the societies live in camp at their own expense and provide comforts for the wounded and ask for nothing but information as to where their services are required but this they can with difficulty obtain There is a general disposition to blame as obstructive to their usefulness the Knights of St John johanniter This order is composed of men of good social posi tion and ample means and theoretically they are supposed to look after the wounded but the humbler workers complain that these gentlemen confine themselves to the light duties of verbal comfort and the distri bution of small delicacies and rather discourage than assist others in doing the hard work which I have indicated However it arises the fact remains that much labour and philanthropy is wasted and much suffering is unrelieved from want of a proper organising head Two examples occur to me A well educated member of the Hamburgh Krankenpflegers told me that after the battle of the 3Ist August at Metz the detachments of his Society went on the field to remove the wounded Having worked till nightfall when complete exhaustion com pelled them to desist from their labour they rested for a few hours leaving many wounded on the field who were still alive At dawn it was found that all of these had died during the night and who can say they would not have recovered with proper attention And yet hun dreds of able volunteerslonging for workmight have been collected in a few hours from towns and villages where their services were no longer urgently required Again from want of organisation it often happens that the wounded despatched homewards travel for four and five days without having their wounds dressed Yet imperfect as is the action of isolated societies they have better means of knowing where help is needed than individuals therefore I would recommend any surgeon going abroad to attach himself to some society and to go where it sends him anid none is better than our National Aid Society Of course my personal observation does not amount to much but I may say that I did not see or hear of a bayonetwound or a sabrecut Another correspondent writing from St Marie aux Chenes on August 22nd provides the following notes Although I left London on the 15th I am still far from my destina tionheadquarters Travelling is indeed slow and wearisome The endless trains of wounded one meets with testify to the cost which Prussia has paid for her unexpected successes I passed through Saar briicken and Herny Falquemont and Remilly and everywhere the houses and hospitals were crowded to overflowing These of course represented the least severe casesmostly fleshwounds  though among them were many who were in a poor condition to undertake a long tiresome journey It was however absolutely necessary to transport them somewhere and the men were equally anxious to go home to their friends It was in Remilly that I first saw anything serious I chanced to have quarters allotted to me in the Chateau Rolland which had been fitted up as a lazarette and was really very comfortable but very short of sur gical appliances There was a poor fellow who had been shot in the head The ball had struck him about the juncture of the parietal and occipital bones behind and had made a complete furrow tearing away scalp and bone and brain altogether He was of course in extremis The Chassepot bullets make a very cleancut wound The calibre of the bullet is very small and being conical I suppose it cuts more freely and with less laceration of the surrounding soft parts especially near its exit The exit in many cases is as small as the entrance hole and it is often difficult to distinguish them The balls sometimes make strange circuits One patient was struck in the middle of the calf of the leg and the bullet passed upwards and forwards splintered the femur just above the kneejoint and came out on the upper and outer surface of the thigh I only stayed one night at Remilly I had to hurry on to St Marie auxChenes where they had been fighting very hard for two or three days We passed through several villages on our wayGorse St Privat and others It was three days after the fighting and it was said officially that there were upwards of 70ooo dead and wounded I could well imagine that to be true for they were lying even on the road sides every house and stable and church and barn being crammed to overflowing and from the fields around for two or three miles there arose such a stench as must be smelt in order to be appreciated In St Marie whence I write there is a very large number of wounded  and it is more especially of these that I can speak as a section was kindly handed over to me In a barn there were twentysix men of these two had bullets through the lungs one in front one behind three had compound fracture of the femur two had bullets in the knee either in or near the joint one had a severe headwound and the remainder were cases of simple shotwounds This is a large proportion of serious cases and I believe I speak truly when I say that in other houses and places the proportion is equally great There were no primary amputations under treatment The medical staff and appliances were so utterly inadequate to the demand that for the first five or six days nothing was done but arrange the men and get them under cover On the 22nd today a few operations were performed amputationsthe circular method being chosen in each case The sur geons seem unwilling to operate much thinking it too late I expect that in either case the mortality will be exceedingly great as the greater number of the cases now remaining are of a very serious nature My stay here will be much too short to give any detailed account either of the results or of the operations which may ultimately be performed To make matters worse there is a great want of water The great demand made on the wells and thedryweathertogethersomewhat account for this Cold applications seemed to be the most agreeable  but water could not be had not even enough for drinking purposes There is a want of cleanliness The charpie and other dressing from the wounds now beginning to suppurate vigorously are simply hidden beneath the straw there to ferment and give rise to odours far from agreeable and such as will not in any way conduce to the wellbeing of the patients who can not get out of the way I believe that this was the cause of a rather severe kind of diarrhoea which troubled the poor fellows very much the more so as they were lying on straw and bedpans were not to be had Compound fractures of the leg are put up in plaster of Paris bandages with a window opposite the wound I am very curious to see the result of this treatment The same correspondent writing from PontaMousson on August 26th says I have just returned from a visit to one of the fieldhospitals and thanks to the kindness of StaffSurgeon Dr D E Muller I saw a good deal in a short time I happerned to reach the place just in time to see an excision of the light anklejoint The man had been shot through the joint obliquely from without inwards The extremity of the fibula was completely broken through and a portion of the lower end of the tibia was also gone It was eight days after the injury had been re ceived An incision had been made for the escape of some pus which had collected and it was through this opening that the real condition of the joint was ascertained A counteropening was made over the inner ankle through which a chainsaw was introduced The lower ends of the tibia and fibula were removed with the upper surface of the astra galus The foot was then put up in plaster of Paris The next case was ligature of the femoral artery The man had been shot through the calf of the leg and the posterior tibial artery was injured Bleeding had come on repeatedly in spite of styptics and ligatures and Sept 17 1870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURNAL 319 so the artery was tied The man was simply put back to bed without further application of either wool or warmth of any kind to the limb I next saw exarticulation of the femur for a compound comminuted fracture of the thigh very high up The bullet could nfot be found The patient had been sent from some one of the villages in the neighbourhood of the battlefield he had been put up in a plaster of Paris bandage extending well round the hip and had certainly borne the journey fairly well These were the only operations which I saw performed We then went round the wards in which were some interesting cases There was a man on whom tracheotomy had been performed five days previously He had been wounded in the throat the ball had not passed through but there was very great cedema  and respiration was so difficult that tracheotomy was determined on He was doing very well and it was proposed to take out the tube on the following day I also saw three cases of excision of the elbowjoint They were being dressed much as we do them in England Instead of resting on cushions they were suspended and swung about easily according as the patient himself moved We then came to a man who had been shot in the upper part of the chest The clavicle had been considerably damaged It was feared the splinters might injure or cut the vein or artery and so nearly the whole clavicle had been extirpated The patient was doing well Dr Muller showed me also a case of excision of the shoulderjoint It had been done in consequence of a complicated in jury involving the whole joint He had performed several amputations both of the thigh and leg  but it was too soon to say much about them I endeavoured to find out whether there was much or any difference in the wound produced by the Chassepot and the Prussian bullet but could learn nothing The Prussian bullets I think are somewhat larger and are eggshaped and are perhaps just a little heavier The hospital had been extemporised out of a large French barrack The wards were large and airy and the patients seemed to be very comfortable I cannot speak too highly of Dr Mullers kindness and courtesy to me a perfect stranger who had to introduce himself as best he could I leave here tomorrow for Commercy TENTHOSPITALS THE following notes on tenthospitals are from a German physician of London who is at present in the neighbourhood of the Rhine The experiments which have been made in the war of I 866 and since to treat the wounded and sick in tents or in wooden houses have led to the adoption of this plan on a larger scale in the present war A tenthospital containing at present two hundred and forty beds is in full working order at Cologne The tents beds and bedding are the gift of the German Association in London in aid of the sick and wounded in the present war Twenty of the tents are already open and there is a supplement of fifteen which will either be used in the same place or forwarded to some other locality where they are more urgently needed The tents were furnished by Messrs Paget Piggot and Edgington and the bedding by Messrs Heal and Co in London Each tent contains ten beds but the superficial area being only sixteen by thirty feet it appeared to us that the beds were too near each other and that eight would be quite a sufficient number for each tent It is worthy of notice however that even in those tents that were quite full of patients with suppurating wounds the air was perfectly sweet This is no doubt in part also due to the excellent system of disinfection which is carried out and of which we shall have to say a few words hereafter At one end of the tent a portion about four feet wide is separated from the rest by a curtain drawn across and opening in the middle behind which on one side a table with different hospital appliances and on the other a MiillerSchiirs closet earthcloset with a disinfectant powder instead of the earth are placed Gas and water are laid on In every tent are suspended one or two of Professor Esmarchs irrigatorstin cans holding about two pints of water which flows out through an Indiarubber tube of sufficient length to be used for all the beds For each patient there is a separate nozzle of hard rubber and this is kept during the time between the dressings in a glass filled with Condys fluid These irrigators are simply used for syringing the wounds and Condys fluid is used for this purpose A most extensive use is made of carbolic acid dissolved either in water or in oil for dressing the wounds All articles of dressing which are not worth washing are burnt the others are kept for twelve hours in a disinfecting fluid containing chlorinated soda before washing them The tents are pitched in a beautiful garden and a con servatory has been fitted up as a washhouse whilst a washhouse and stable have been admirably transformed into a kitchen and larder The administration of the whole hospital is in the hands of the indefatigable Mr Deichmann of London The medical service is performed by several practitioners of Cologne of whom Dr Servais one of the lead ing men at Cologne is day and night on the premises besides two assistants The household department and the nursing are in the hands of several ladies belonging to the first families of the town Upon the whole nothing could make a better impression than the order and cleanliness of this hospital The diet is very liberal Every patient gets meat twice a day plenty of beeftea eggs and beer in fact the only limit seems to be his capacity for digesting If the mili tary world has been astonished at the complete change which Germany has undergone in military matters within the last few years the medical world may not be the less surprised at the complete overthrow of the notions which not long ago were prevailing in Germany as to diet dressing of wounds and ventilation Open windows are now the order of the day or the patients are kept under tents or they are car ried in their beds in the open air whenever the weather allows it Condys fluid carbolic acid and chloride of lime are used in all hos pitals extensively Three tents at Cologne are of a somewhat different shape from the English ones being somewhat wider They are the regulation tents of the Prussian Army Medical Service and were bought at Cologne It will be gratifying for the English makers to learn that their tents stood the drenching rains prevailing lately better than those made at Cologne although they also let a little rain pass through especially over the ventilator at the top the arrangement of which might be sonmewhat improved At Bonn there are altogether fifteen lhospitals for the wounded and several magnificent villasamong others the house of Professor Busch have been fitted up for the reception of patients We saw many severe cases about a dozen where the arm had been amputated several amputations of the thigh one case of resection of the humerus and several of the elbowjoint Most of the patients were doing remark aby well all whom we saw were under the care of Dr von Mosengeil There were several curious cases of bullets having entered the pelvis and where symptoms on the part of the bladder or rectum had been present and in which there could hardly be a doubt of the peritoneum being wounded and yet the patients were doing well and no periton itis had set in The surgeons are under the impression that the wounds upon the whole heal more quickly in the French  but that the Ger mans bear pain better There is a good deal of dysentery among the wounded coming from the front A tenthospital similar to that at Cologne is about being established at Bingen The tents for two hundred and fifty to three hundred patients with all the furniture and bedding are also given by the German Association in London Dr Thudichum is at the head of the undertaking and Mr John Simon who is spending his holiday at Bingen is also taking a most active part in it and his cooperation will prove most valuable Eleven young English surgeons from different London hospitals are engaged to act as dressers and assistants We learn that the National Society in London bears the expenses of the latter and that this Society has also supplied instruments A site has already been found on the Rochneberg and we trust that before another week has passed white flags with the red cross will indicate the existence of this truly international hospital MEDICAL SYSTEM OF THE GERMAN ARMY DURING WAR THE following is from our Special Correspondent dated Berlihi Sep tember 7 1870 In my last letter see JOURNAL Sept 3rd p 254 I gave a sketch of the organisation of the military medical service and I still have to com plete it in several points Part of the places are filled by the military surgeons whose number in peace is sufficient for all demands when the army is mobilised through the whole country the medical men as well as all other men of certain ages are bound to military service but in gene ral their number together with that of the military surgeons does not fully make up the full medical staff of the mobile army amounting to more than 3ooo The deficiency is made good as far as possible by medical volunteers taken partly from among the elder students Any vacancies that remain are in general among the troops the field hospitals the sanitary detachments and the hospital reserve of every army corps are made complete these bodies being destined for the first hospital treatment of the wounded On the average the proportion of the persoznzel among them is this one surgeon for thirtythree patients one Lazarethgehiilfe hospital helper for twentyfive and one nurse for thirteen patients In the whole army there is about one surgeon for each two hundred and fifty men The reserve hospitals are established either in garrison hospitals or in other buildings approved of by the provincial general surgeon Their Notes Of The WarSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 515 Nov 12 1870 pp

to this scheme one which is considerably modified from that in practice in Germany He thinks that as there the State alone should give the licence to practise and that all the powers which the different bodies possess of granting such licence after examination should be bought up At the same time the State should not examine any candidate with a view to licence till he could present a certificate or degree from some recognised teaching body In this way while all merely examining boards would be supplanted by the State on the other hand the universities and other schools would devote themselves to teaching their degree or cer tificate not being a licence to practise but merely a certificate of having completed a given course of study to the satisfaction of the teachers Professor Young also advocated a higher standard of medi cal education The difficulty has been raised that there are many parts where the remuneration of practice is too low ever to induce men of sufficient education to enter the profession To meet this a system of increasing the income of such practitioners by a State grant was ad vocated and it was suggested that this might well be done by the State adding to the subsidy which it at present gives towards supplying paro chial medical relief NOTES OF THE WAR THE SICK AND WOUNDED AT METZ OUR Berlin correspondent writes as follows under date Nov 8th The special trains for sick and wounded are now going more regularly and in greater number Some are arranged by the commissaries of evacuation at Weissenburg and are to go between that place and Cha lons and Paris The first train of this kind which was fitted out and sent by the  Berlin Hiilfsverein has now gone for the third time to fetch wounded from Metz On its second course this train brought home ninetyeight severely wounded mostly belonging to the first and tenth army corps two carriages of it stayed atCourcelles and were destined to pass through Metz for Noveant to fetch some of the wounded there I am sorry to say that some of the young volunteer nurses who accom panied the train caught fever during their expedition to the fieldhos pitals It is known through the newspapers what a large number of sick are among the garrison and the inhabitants of Metzcases of fever hospital gangrene and smallpox so frequent these last months among the French are very numerous To prevent the spreading of these dis eases the army medical department sent an order immediately after the capitulation that the patients in Metz were not to be sent to Germany but that other measures were to be taken in behalf of them For this purpose a commission is nominated to inspect the hospitals and to consider the circumstances as a member of this commission Professor Frerichs left Berlin last week The Mfedical Schools From the absence of our principal medical teachers and of the majority of the students very few of the medical classes have been opened at the regular term The Charite in other years crowded by students in this month is nearly as lonely as in the hot weather and among those who go to the few lectures really opened up to the present time the majority are foreigners The course of war and politics will decide whether we shall have a regular me dical  semester this winter at all WarMuseumAmong the measures for the advantage of science arising out of the war I may mention the medical and surgical war museum established in the  Friedreich WilhelmsInstitut our medical school for the army It is expected that every surgeon occupied with the troops will collect interesting anatomical preparations as far as time and circumstances allow and send them with notes to this museum Even now among the post mortem examinations in the  Barracken near Berlin a good number of fine specimens are collected  and I am informed that the last hospitaltrain brought also a series from the hospitals near Metz Abuse of tize Red Cross The following is the text of an order issued by the King  The red cross of the Convention of Geneva is to be worn by no one otherwise than on the armband eg not on the cap Wearing the white armband with the red cross even when it is stamped does not give the right of travelling freely in those parts of France which are occupied by the army When a free intercourse of the public is not desirable particularly among the out posts on the Etappenroads railways etc the military authorities and the gendarmes have to control the legitimation of the wearers of the red cross in order to prevent the intercourse of the occupied territory with the enemy and to disburden the streets of useless transports The legitimation of wearing the red cross band and the legitimation as a member of the voluntary aid will be granted in the German armies by the royal commissary and military inspector of the voluntary aid Prince Pless by the royal military commissary of Bavaria Count Castell and by the Wiirtemberg Aid Society Free travelling by rail and re quisition of carriages will be allowed to legimated persons only if they have a written permission for travelling signed by one of the above named authorities or by one of their delegates In case of doubt on this point the royal Etappencommander will communicate with the re spective local delegates of the aidsocieties The military authorities are specially instructed to pay attention to persons who are not Ger man subjects wearing the red cross Persons of this kind travelling without legitimation by the abovenamed authorities will be arrested as suspicious Considering the numerous cases of abuse of the red cross and the crowd of battleloafers it seems to be in the interest of those who really wish to help that there will be a more strict control in future and we are sure that the members of British aidsocieties will not com plain of this formality necessary for the advantage of the wounded and of themselves HOSPITAL AT DARMSTADT THE AMain Zeifung a Hesse paper speaks very highly of the Alice Hos pital at Darmstadt devoted to the treatment of soldiers suffering from internal diseases It is under the protection of the Princess Alice  whom says the Zeituing  we are accustomed to see at the head of so many philanthropic undertakings and has been established by the English Society for the Sick and Wounded in the War The Hessian Government granted the necessaryaccommodation and there are usually about eighty patients mostly suffering from typhus and dysentery The Crown Princess recently visited the hospital on the 2Ist ultimo and in spected the wards and the whole of the domestic arrangements as also one of Dr Mayos new sick transport cars The staff consists of Dr Mayo Fellow of New College Oxford Mr J C Galton Lec turer on Comparative Anatomy at the Charing Cross Hospital Mr H Rundle formerly HouseSurgeon at Winchester Hospital and Mr Atthill Dresser at St Georges Hospital London Some ladies be longing to the Hulfsverein manage the household arrangement and the nurses of that Society attend on the patients THE ENGLISH AMBULANCES AT VERSAILLES THE English ambulance writes Dr Russell is to remain at St Ger main where it will not have much to do unless there is another sortie There is one casea man with an injured finger But the time of the surgeons will not be lost Some have set about learning French others I believe go round and look at the hospitals There are thirty wounded Prussians in the palace close byvery close to the collection of antiquities made by the Emperor who has left there something to France The waggonshorribly ugly and heavy and contrasting very unfavourably with the French ambulancesare parked in the court and paradeground flanked by the bronze battery of the Guard Landwehr The determination to send all or part to Corbeil has been resisted effectually THE BERLIN CENTRAL SOCIETY FOR THE AID OF THIE SICK AND WOUNDED THE managers of the German society at Berlin for the aid of the sick and wounded in war have issued a statement of their operations up to Oct 23rd of which we have received a copy The station is in connec tion with chief depofts at Coblenz Mayence Mannheim and Nancy and with branch depots at Saarlouis Saarbriicken Weissenburg Hagenau Jouy aux Asches Courcelles Remilly Pont a Mousson Noveant Ars sur Aloselle Gorze Ligny Gravelotte St Marie aux Chenes Libra mont Sedan Donchery Mouzon Chalons Rheims Epernay Meaux Chateau Thierry Corbeil and Versailles During the three months from July 23rd to October 23rd there were sent from the central dep6t to the other depots 132 consignments to the lazareths 429  to the army in the field 33 in all 594 consignments The cost of furnishing the consignments has amounted to about 1380000 thalers g201250 inclusive of the rich contributions of material made by the aidsocieties of the free towns and placed at the disposal of the central committee The sum does not include the gifts in kind made by societies and pri vate individuals an estimate of their value in money will be made on another occasion The committee thank the German railway companies for the aid afforded them in promptly forwarding their consignments  especially the directors of the Berlin and Anhalt railway the Berlin Potsdam and Magdeburg railway and the Hanover railway The Nov 12 1870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL OVRNAL forwarding by direct transport of woollen and warm clothing to the armies in the field has been essentially limited inasmuch as the supply has been furnished by the military organisation and thus the hurtful operation of the wet and cold weather has been obviated Until this was done the central committee believed it to be a part of its duty to make provision of this kind in order to prevent serious disease not withstanding that it would have involved an outlay of about 500o00 thalers about 64000 For the evacuation of the lazareths before Metz a transport carriage has been fitted out under the superintendence of Herr von Honicka and has already proved of service Moveable detachments provided with supplies of all kindsmaterials for dress ing necessaries for the lazareths woollen clothing medicines and re freshments have followed the army before Paris and have endeavoured to afford the most practical help to the adjoining lazareths  several new detachments have been sent out for the same purpose New depots have been established at Chalons Rheims Meaux Chateau Thierry and Versailles and new icedepots at Meaux and Nancy A large number of properly qualified persons provided with the necessary disiiufectants have been sent to the

aidcommittee of Paris has proceeded to Tours and has established ambulances in Tours Orleans and Chalons surMarne In the department of the Arne several landed proprietors have established ambulances from their own means THE SICK AND IWOUNDED IN DRESDEN MOST of the cases of disease among the French prisoners lately brought to Dresden were of typhus  there were also several cases of smallpox In the three hospitals of the town thereare about i58o sick and wounded of whom more than 7oo are French THE PROPOSED ROYAL SOCIETY OF MEDICINE AFTER the conclusion of the ordinary business of the meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society on Tuesday evening the meeting was made special for the purpose of confirming or rejecting the follow ing resolution proposed by Mr Paget seconded by Dr Quain and passed at a special meeting of the Society on October 25th  That the Council be requested to consider whether while main taining the charter and constitution of the Royal Medical and Chirur gical Society it may be possible to obtain a more complete cooperation with the Pathological Obstetrical Clinical and Epidemiological or other Societies for the promotion of Medical science The minutes of the previous meeting having been read and confirmed as to their accuracy The PRESIDENT Dr BURROWS read the byelaw of the Society referring to the business of special meetings and pointed out that no question could be discussed of which notice had not been given Dr ROBERT LEE moved and Dr MURCHISON seconded the con firmation of the resolution Dr GREENHOW asked whether he would be in order in proposing an amendment The PRESIDENT decided that he would not Dr GREENHOW said that he would have given notice had he been aware that it was necessary He would at once submit however to the Presidents decision With regard to the motion before the meet in g if he were convinced that it really expressed the wish of the Society he would not oppose it Taking a retrospective view of the scheme tracing it through all its stages and pointing out how important a par t the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society had taken in promoting it he could not help thinking that the resolution did not represent th e feeling of the members of the Society He believed it probable that many of the members present at the last meeting voted rather from personal respect to the proposer than from regard to the merits of the question No no He would ask whether it was desirable that the amalgamation scheme should be strangled by those who had given birth to it Dr JOHN WEBSTER remarked that the assent of twothirds of the Fellows of the Society present at a general meeting was necessary in order to make any change in the laws or constitution of the Society Dr BARCLAY hoped that the resolution would not be confirmed He would inform the Fellows present that Mr Paget had been asked after the last meeting whether he was aware that a plan similar to that proposed by him had already been discussed and that the Pathological Society had refused its assent unless there were such a change in the name and style of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society as would place all the Societies on an equal footing He regretted that the Council of the Society had presented a mere report without offering any advice as to the course which should be followed At the last discussion the opponents of the amalgamation scheme had admitted the great advantages to the profession which would arise from it They had used even stronger language in its favour than he would employ and he could not understand why they voted against it It was a great pity that if the scheme was to fall through it should be in consequence of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society declining to go on with it The Society had shown more selfabnegation and had more readily laid aside considerations of selfinterest and selfregard than any other Society It would then be a pity that the Royal Medical and Chirur gical Society should be the first to retreat It was true that there was a strong minority among whom were men whose opinions were to be respected and perhaps it would be well not to press on the scheme too fast If the meeting refused to confirm the resolution the result would be to send the matter back to the Council and leave it to them to proceed with the scheme in such manner and at such a time as they might think advisable Dr MOXON thought that the amalgamation scheme was in reality not in favour with the Pathological Societythat is to say with those members of that Society who ordinarily attended its meetings Dr PITMAN said that the question must be looked at from a prac tical point of view In order to carry out a scheme of amalgamation there must be great unanimity The proposal was not to merely change the name of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society but to extinguish it and form a new Society This could not be done withou t a new charter Was it possible to get one A number of member s were opposed to this and therefore he thought it would not be pos  sible He thought that the Society would be wasting labour if i t pushed the scheme further at present After some remarks from Mr BROOKE and Dr WYNN WILLIAMS a vote was taken when there appeared For confirming Mr Pagets

delivered on November ist by Dr Joseph Bell Dr Gillespie a President of the Royal College of Surgeons was in the Chair There were also present Dr Halliday Douglas President of the Royal Col lege of Physicians and a large numberof members of the medical pro fession and of students Dr Joseph Bell congratulated the students on their choice of a school of medicine Edinburgh had for centuries been a noted centre of edu cation and for nearly two hundred years unrivalled in the world as a medical school The explanation of this undoubted fact might possibly be that the proverbial industry and perseverance of Scotchmen had given Edinburgh many hard working and accomplished professors but he believed the main reason was because it consisted of two rival or apparently rival but really cooperating schools which were so near each other as practically to be under the same roof Another reason was its concentration He was thankful to be able to tell only of gains to the school this

very interesting private letter from Dr Rose Cormack who is in surgical charge of an ambulance in Paris and have been permitted to make the following extracts Last week was in many respects the most eventful exciting and laborious week of my whole life This you will be able to understand at once when I tell you that I was in two great battleson Wednesday 30th November and Friday 2nd December On both days unavoid able circumstancesnot likely to recurplaced me in great danger as I shall now explain to you I may premise that I was not the only member of the surgical service subjected to peril Several of the ambu lance service were wounded on the two days I have named On Tuesday 29th November I was out all day with my ambulance and heard the roar of the battle but was not in it On Wednesday from six in the morning till next day at ten oclock I was without in termission hard at work At the latter hour I returned with my pa tients to my own ward at Les Ternes I slept some hours after this and again joined the army I returned to Paris about midnight of Friday and have since been occupied with my patients Probably I go out to another battle expected in two or three days On Wednesday I was with the right wing of Ducrots army at Cre teil For some hours I was stationed very favourably for seeing a great part of the battle The day was clear I was for some time on the roof of a house in the midst of reserves of infantry and artillery and quite out of danger I had a good fieldglass Colonel Hicks acting as infirmier was with me About eleveni oclock we were ordered to the frontabout a mile from where we lhad been mere spectators leaving our wagons and advancing with our stretchers and  croix rouge flags to a place where there were heaps of dead and wounded I was one of a party of four doctors and about forty carriers and other subordinates I worked diligently staunching blood and placing those with broken bones so that they could be carried to the rear to our car riages This was going on when Hicks with glass in hand said Doctor you afst look at this pretty skirmishing of the Prussians and then we must retirethe French are giving way in front of us I rose from the ground to take a peep when a regiment began to pass our post into action They had not been ten minutes clear off and had only fired one or two rounds when they were driven back at first they retired in some order but in a few minutes they were on us in a crush ing crowd and the Prussian fire was getting nearer and nearer We had to leave our wounded Iiicks and I tried to carry one poor fellow who was on a brancard but after a few yards there was nothing for it but to leave him A ball struck the ground with a thud within a few inches of Hickss foot another struck a stone near me and after dancing hither and thither for an instant lay quietly before me I put it in my pocket All this happened within a briefer space of time than it has taken me to write it We retreated as fast as we could with the receding infantry Soon however the retreat moderated Up came three fieldguns and a mitrailleuse The i17th Regiment began to reform still the Prussians were getting nearer and nearer when the mitrailleuse taking up a position exactly in frent of that where we had abandoned the wounded and within a very short distance of the enemy sent three showers of bullets at them The fieldguns did not fire though ready to do so  at once the Prussians ceased their musketry the I 17th French renewed their attack and within an hour of the time when we left the wounded we were back to them and with the assistance of other doctors etc sent to us we completed our work My staffI had charge of two wagonswere however dispersed and it was not till next day that they all turned up The night of Wednes day I passed partly in a church and partly in a chateau ministering to the wounded I had also some hours of sound sleep in a deserted house of which we took possession On Friday evening I was waiting orders to advance when a priest came to our carriages He said that he had been confessing dying French soldiers on the brow of a hill to which he pointed where he said there were at least fifty lying wounded and dying from cold The sun had now set the moon was rising  a keen cutting wind was blow ing from the north For me and halfadozen brantcardiers to go alone so far when we had work nearer seemed absurd  but the priest was urgent Our wagons were a mile and a half nearer he said than any others I agreed to go on but told the priest to go back to a certain point where I knew that more than a hundred wagons were waiting orders to advance This he agreed to do and we set off to climb the hill On reaching a shattered house in the lane we heard moans and entered The house was full of dead and dying An army surgeon was in charge he said that he had got cut off from his carriages and assistants At his request I sent back one of my stretchers with a very badly wounded man I was told by a captain commanding a guard that it would be dangerous to advance to the spot indicated by the priest that it was close to the Prussian lines and that the battle was not quite over We might he said go to a certain point which he in dicated but we had on the whole better wait till general orders were given to the ambulances    At this time we heard plaintive cries  the words  Franqais  blesse and  froid being distinctly recog nised I said to the captain that if he would allow me two or three men as porters I would seek out the poor fellow and do what his case required The captain agreed stating however that we must screen our lantern and go silently otherwise we would be shot at by the Prus sian outposts within whom we would be not more than fifty yards He said to his men Any three of you may accompany the doctor to bring in a comrade who has been moaning and crying for the last two hours over there After some hesitation three came forward laid down their arms and joined us in the search Silently we advanced stumbling on stones in the uncertain light of a goodfornothing moon aided by a lantern  the latter was screened in front but the screening cloak was blown aside by the wind and in a minute afterwards we heard three Prussian bullets whizzing about our heads We lay down and after ten minutes got into a quarry where we found our plaintive blessd cold as death and his clothes which had been soaked in Ilis warm blood were frozen stiff We gave him a drink of gravy and brandy bound his wound placed him on the stretcher and after various ad ventures started for Paris The poor fellow whom we took out of the quarry seemed as if he would die on the road I therefore resolved that if we got him alive to Paris he should occupy one of two beds which I had ordered to be ready in my diningroom Before midnight he and another of our cargo a man shot through the thigh were de posited in the room and left there for two hours whilst I took the rest to Les Ternes and did the needful On coming back I found the two poor fellows even the quarry fellowsomewhat rallied by heat externally and internally applied in accordance with my orders Their clothes were cut off them they were washed and dressed and bedded and are nowat the end of a weekdoing well They are as soon as they can be removed to occupy two of six beds which I have had in stalled as an auxiliary military ambulance in the flat now unlet above ours When I lay down on Saturday morning in my own bed after placing my quarry friend and his shattered thigh as well as the case allowed his moans rather soothed me for I felt that had I not taken him when I did he must have died The ambulances did not till after midnight go on the field an armistice of an hour then took place when Prussians and French gathered respectively their dead and wounded The carriages which we left near the heights of Champigny did not reach Paris till seven next morning In coming into Paris on that night I had an adventure which seems nothing to tell but which frightened me more than any incident of either battle When crossing the Marne on the pontoons by the moon light our waggon jolted and tottered as if about to fall into the water which was a swollen heavy stream This happened though men at each side steadied the carriage Though frightened at the time I had forgotten my fright till I read in a newspaper that some six hours after I passed an ambulance with six wounded soldiers had toppled into the stream The horse was drowned  the men were saved On Friday the wounded horses were killed skinned and cut up for Paris food The Americans brought back a whole horse for their patients For food we have a meat ticket which we are entitled to use every third day one day we get fresh beef or mutton the next time fresh horse  the third time salt beef salt mutton or salt fish The daily allowance for each person is now fifty grammesthat is half a pound a day in all for the five persons constituting our present family in other words all that we get each time for three days use is a pound and a half All the animals in the Zoological Gardens have been eaten cats and dogs have also been devoured to such an extent that they are now rare animals in Paris Our conzcierge has killed and eaten his cat a friend called on us the other evening after having dined on a rat ragouit Notwithstand ing this queer style of living the general health seems as yet good Our own family is very well indeed though we long for milk butter eggs and other luxuries long untasted by us and not procurable The anxieties and privations of the siege are now such as to call for faith hope and courage We have them and are quite willing cheer fully to suffer longer still if it be thought that prolonged suffering and resistance will save France from humiliation My ambulance duties have been successful and appreciated Dec 17 1870 THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 665 MEDICAL PREPARATIONS FOR SIEGE AT LYONS IN the prospect of siege Lyons has been divided into four parts to each of which is assigned a section of the ambulance organisation of the city Each section comprises a surgeoninchief a surgeon adjoinZ and a certain number of medical officers and of assistants taken from among the hospital internes and students one or more apothecaries and a certain number of squads of infirmary nurses selected from men who are not liable to be called on for military duty viz Frenchmen from 40 to 6o years of age with a large number of Swiss and Italians who have shown much zeal in offering their services The four chief surgeons are MM Petrequin Bouchacourt Rollet and Delore There is a large supply of necessaries and it is believed that should it be required more will be provided THE MIEDICAL SERVICE OF THE MOBILES THE Lyon M6dicale of the 4th instant contains the text of a circular issued by M Gambetta to the generals and intendants of divisions and the prefects of departments It is as follows At the commencement of the present war measures were taken to legulate as far as possible the medical service of the Garde Mobile and to keep in reserve suf ficient resources for certain eventualities These measures were de scribed in a circular dated September Ist by which the generals of division were authorised to appoint one medical officer to each bat talion of the Garde Mobile and to keep at their homes all men called on to serve who could prove the possession of a degree of doctor in medicine or in pharmacy or of at least twelve inscriptions In conse quence of the recent decree calling out all the able men aged from 21 to 40 provision must be made for the medical service of the new forces The following measures are therefore decreed i The generals of division preserve the right of directly nominating one medical officer to each battalion of the National Guard in conformity with the terms of the circular of September ISt 2 Every corps mobilised in pursu ance of the decree above alluded to must before marching be provided with one medical officer to each battalion or force equivalent to a bat talion 3 The generals of division in concert with the prefects of de partments will issue direct commissions to the medical officers of the mobilised corps and will give an account to the minister of war of the nominations made by them As far as possible the medical officers should be chosen from the arrondissement furnishing the corps Pre ference is to be given to doctors in medicine these failing the generals of division may nominate ofciers de sante or medical students having sixteen inscriptions 4 Applications for medical employment in the mobilised corps must be sent to the generals of division those ad dressed to the minister of war will not be answered 5 The medical officers nominated by the generals will have the rank and grade of aide mtzajor of the first class if they possess the diploma of doctor in medi cine  and that of aidlemzajor of the second class if they are only officiers de sant6 and can only producesixteen inscriptions They will receive the pay and allowances corresponding to these ranks 6 The same classification will be made in the case of future nominations of medical officers to the Garde Mobile but no modification of grade is to have a retrospective effect 7 The generals of division and the prefects will take the necessary measures for exempting from mobilisation a all doctors of medicine and oficiers de sanzh b all students of medicine or pharmacy having at least sixteen inscriptions  c all druggists established in business 8 Students having less than sixteen inscrip tions will not be exempted from service 9 In other respects the direc tions given in the circular of September Ist as to the requisition of me dical officers for the service of bodies of troops or of military hospitals are not interfered with ALLEGED INFRACTIONS OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION BY THE PRUSSIANS THE Lyont Afidical complains bitterly of the manner in which the regu lations of the Geneva Convention have been set aside by the Germans It is said that to a remonstrance made by the staff of the first Lyons ambulance General Werder replied  We know the Geneva Conven tion but the war which we are making is a special war General von Treskow is also reported to have refused admission to Belfort to two medical men alleging that  to succour the sick or wounded in a besieged place was equivalent to a revictualling  The Lyon M6dical also publishes a letter from a member of the staff of the Vesinet ambulance He says that the ambulance came within the Prussian lines on Septem ber 2ISt and on October Ist the wounded were removed and the staff sent as prisoners to Versailles There they addressed a protest to the Crown Prince who caused them to be set at liberty and sent back to the ambulance which however had been in the meantime occu pied and the provisions seized The officers of the ambulance were after their return daily visited by a Prussian medical officer with a patrol there were still twelve patients whom it had not been possible to remove One morning they were visited by the Crown Prince who pointed out that they were very near MontValerien and in a very ex posed situation and offered them safe conducts to go whither they pleased This they declined stating that they had been appointed by the minister of war and could only quit their posts by his order or under violence On November 4th they received through a captain a message to hold themselves ready for starting They were informed that they were to go to Metz In reply to their statement that they were without resources they were told that they would receive money at Corbeil On arriving at that place however they only got billets for a nights lodging without food and they had to give their word of honour that they would not quit the road to Metz Through the kind ness of the inhabitants of the places through which they passed they were supplied with food The journey occupied five days during two of which it was made in carts guarded by a dozen Prussians On arriving at Metz they were told by the French surgeonmajor that they were not required and might go where they would he also gave them a letter to the Prussian medical officer who however would not allow them to depart They received billets for lodging for two days from the mairie and were most hospitably treated by the inhabitants After in vain endeavouring to obtain employment or persuade the Germans to allow them to depart they escaped in the disguise of townsmen The writer of the letter reached Luxembourg where he obtained money from the French Consul and was going to join the Army of the North THE Municipal Council of Lyons has allotted a credit of 25000 francs oiooo to the Society for aiding the wounded THE order of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour has been conferred on account of zeal and devotion in the care of the wounded on M Bresson metdecin aidemtajor of the first class and MM Maury Robuchon and Heune pupils of the military medical school at Stras bourg SMALLPOX IN LONDON AT a meeting of the Epidemiological Society on Wednesday evening the President Dr SEATON Inspector of Vaccination to the Privy Coun cil called attention to the present rapidly extending epidemic of small pox in a highly important statement of which we are enabled to present a full report There were various parts of the kingdom especially unions in Yorkshire and Lancashire in which smallpox had been epidemic dur ing the present year and the inhabitants had again entered on one of those epidemic visitations of that disease from which the metropolis was never free for more than two years together Tracing the course of smallpox in London for the last twenty years he showed that the last epidemic period terminated about the middle of i868 and that from that time to the middle of the present year the mortality from that disease had been compara tively small The minimum was reached in the quarter ending Mid summer I869 for which quarter only 55 deaths were recorded or fewer than are now occurring in a single week In the Michaelmas quarter of I869 the deaths were but 62  in the Christmas quarter they were 87 in the first quarter of 1870 they were 99 in the second II8 in the third 157 or an average of 12 a week In the first five weeks of the present quarter the weekly average was 20  in the next three weeks 42 and in the last two weeks 6o There had in fact in ten weeks of the quarter been 348 deaths registered Though the epi demic was already diffused over a great part of London and daily be coming more and more diffused it was in the eastern districts that as on former occasions it had chiefly prevailed and the circumstances under which it had been so fatal in them were in every respect the same as those in which it had on former occasions been fatalgross and un lawful neglect of vaccination and in many of the adults who had suf fered the imperfect performance of vaccination which had not been remedied by a subsequent revaccination The President remarked that if atthetimewhen thepresent Vaccination Act should according to its requirements have come into full operation i e in July i868all had been done which should have been done if two precious years of comparative immunity from smallpox had not been to a great extent thrown away and if the metropolitan Boards generally had only taken from the first the course which a few of them really did take to administer properly the provisions of the law Lon don would not have been in the state of unpreparedness for the present epidemic in which a large proportion of it is now He said that the successful working of the Act depended on each local authority having a proper inspector to see as his regular and constant duty that the children whose births are registered have the certificate of successful vaccination in due time recorded and to see instantly on the occur rence of any case of smallpox that the children

NO THOROUGHFARE THE refusal of the French to allow the wounded in the recent bat tles to be transmitted to the hospitals of AixlaChapelle involves a difference of three days against three hours transit that is to say it signs the deathwarrant of some thousands of their own countrymen as well as of their wounded enemies It is true that some problematical advantage may be derived from the terrible aggravation of mortality and suffering involved in the refusal to allow the combatant army to relieve themselves of this load but it must be remembered that precisely similar advantages are accorded by the con ditions of the treaty of Geneva which allow the combatants on either side to leave their wounded within the enemys territory under the pro tection of the redcross flag and which neutralise alike the wounded the ambulances and the medical officers on both sides and relieve the retreating combatants of their encumbrances In the rout of Mac Mahons army one hundred and two members of the French medical staff were cut off comprising seventyfive surgeons and thirtyseven assistants All have been sent back vid Cologne and Belgium over this neutral territory No objection has been made nor is likely to be made to their travelling by this route The severely wounded are now expressly neutralised and we cannot help feeling deep regret that they are not allowed to be sent to hospital by the shortest route over neutral territory ARMY MEDICAL OFFICERS OF NEUTRAL POWERS THE refusal of the British Government to allow unemployed army and navy medical officers to give their services in the FrancoPrussian war is not easily to be explained in the face of the opposite measures agreed to at the International Conference last year at Berlin of the opposite course now being pursued by other governments as the Russian and Swiss and of the interests of English medical science and of English soldiers One of the measures agreed upon at the International Con ference respecting volunteer aid to wounded soldiers in time of war held last year at Berlin was the following  In case of war non belligerent powers are invited to place at the disposal of the belligerents those surgeons of their army whom they are able to lend without dis advantage to their own service such delegated surgeons to be placed under the orders of the principal medical officer of the belligerent army to which they may be attached The Governments of France and North Germany on the opening of the present war both announced their intention of accepting and acting upon the resolutions agreed upon at the Berlin Congress Accordingly the Federal Government of Switzerland as a neutral nonbelligerent power has offered to the French and German Governments a number of surgeons of their army staff who had volunteered to go Both of the belligerents have accepted the offer through their respective ministers at Berne and have ex pressed themselves thankful for the assistance The Swiss army sur geons destined for France are ordered to report themselves for further instructions to the Central Committee of Volunteer Aid to the Wounded sitting at Paris those for Germany to the corresponding Committee at Berlin We understand that a large number of surgeons of our own army desirous not only of helping in the hospitals but also of gaining military surgical experience have applied to be allowed to give their services in a similar way but their applications have not been acceded to notwithstanding that the reason given for no examinations for ad mission into the army medical department being held at present is that the department is overnumbered Captain W Noble RA Deputy DirectorGeneral of Ordnance and Captain Brackenbury R A have left Woolwich for the respective seats of war the former for Prussia the latter for France to watch the military operations and report to the English Government so that the objection to make the necessary arrangements for sending medical officers appears all the more un accountable THE CONVENTION OF GENEVA THE advantages secured to the wounded by the Geneva Convention are manifesting themselves every day during the present war which is the first which has occurred between two Powers both of whom had signed the treaty When the war occurred in I866 between Prussia and Austria Prussia had signed the treaty but Austria had not Be fore the war however had concluded although not until fighting had ceased Austria seeing the advantages offered by the Convention applied to be admitted as one of the signataries to it an application which was at once acceded to One of the principal articles of the Convention was the neutralisation of the personnel and the mat6riel of the hospitals moving with an army in the fieldof all in short that is absolutely necessary for affording the first means of saving the lives or lessening the sufferings of the wounded who are placed hors de combat after each succeeding engagement One can see the importance of this pro vision from the information which reached London on the 20th inst in a telegram from Brussels A French field hospital completecomprising fifteen surgeons ninety infirmiers eight ambulance vehicles and their horseswas captured by the Prussians near Metz and sent on by them to Cologne but at the date of the telegram the whole was passing through Belgium on its way back to France Before the Geneva Con vention all the persons belonging to this hospital establishment would have been retained and treated as prisoners of war while the carriages and rest of the hospital equipment would have become prize of war The military reasons which led the Prussians to send back this French military hospital through Belgium instead of returning it across the ground on which the Prussian army was manceuvring are sufficiently obvious One or two telegrams have referred to field hospitals being fired upon contrary to the terms of the Geneva treaty No doubt ex planation will be given of these supposed infractions of the Convention  but it is to be remembered that the Convention particularly provides that the neutrality of the field hospitals is to cease if they are placed in positions of strategic importance Their neutralisation might be taken advantage of to secure important military ends were this provision not made indeed no government could have been expected to sign the treaty without such an exception being attached to it THE WOUNDED IN FRANCE OuR correspondence from Paris includes the following items There are indications that the grievous official incompetence and obstructive ness which have weighed on the efforts of professional and nonpro fessional volunteers and subscribers to the aid of the wounded in the war is about to come to an end No words can express the grievous injury which it has done The inkndancegdnJrale which has blocked the way will probably be swept on one side by General TrochuThe Faculty of Medicine have just formally placed at the service of the Minister of War all their professors agreges and pupils in a body The provincial Faculties are taking a similar courseThe Medical Dean of the Faculty of Montpellier has abandoned has salary in favour of the wounded whilst the war lasts he has added a furcher subscrip tion of 500 francs his own services and his Chateau de Grammont One thousand seven hundred physicians and students have inscribed their names as volunteers at the ValdeGrfaceDr Cunier of the First Corps private physician of Marshal MacMahon has been made prisoner at Reichshoffen and notwithstanding the neutrality convention has not reappeared Other surgeons captured have however been set free by the PrussiansThe Aid Society has at short notice esta blished a permanent hospital at the Gare de Strasbourg communi cating with the station by an inclined plane The wounded are received there at once on issuing from the railwaycarriages and either retained there or forwarded after their wounds are dressed according to cir cumstances NOTES OF AN AUSTRIAN SURGEON A CORRESPONDENT of the Wiener Medzzinische Wochenschrift writing from Heidelberg on the 15th instant at which place he had arrived on the previous day in charge of 500 wounded says that Billroth was fully employed as principal surgeon at Weissenburg where he had charge of a hospital of 500 wounded His assistant Dr Czerny had the care of IOO The correspondent says that the difficulties of the medical staff are great and manifold The number of wounded scattered in all direc tions in Germany must exceed 15000 The French ignore the regula tions of the Geneva convention their army surgeons do not wear the white band with the red cross and the transport service labours clumsily but earnestly and fearlessly to remove the wounded from the battlefield even in the midst of showers of bullets After the battle of Worth he saw an ambulance waggon overturned on the declivity of a mountain and lying under it three wounded menone in articulo mortis who had evidently been left on the spot in consequence of the over turn and of the flight of the drivers The French he says have made no improvement in their ambulances notwithstanding their experience in Italy and Mexico they still use for the conveyance of the wounded carriages which are dark and unventilated The question of providing bedsteads is still unsettled Billroth though a man of great energy could not provide beds for his patients in less than eight days The Prussian members of the order of St John and their conduct are be yond all praise they supplied the writers transportwaggon with all pssible necessaries and comforts There is a want of means for the 226  THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURNAL August 27 1870 transport of the wounded from the field of battle and of operators in the ambulances after the fight The neutral powers as a rule do not appear to trouble themselves about carrying out the resolutions arrived at in Berlin last year by sending out army surgeons to the seat of war AID TO THE SICK AND WOUNDED COLONEL LOYD LINDSAY states that there are now twenty English surgeons serving under the Society for giving aid to the sick and wounded in equal proportions on the French and German sides The Society continues to receive applications for surgeons Eight thousand French wounded are in the German Hospitals Dr Mayo who is the chief representative of the Society in Germany has gone forward to the frontier after having had interviews with the Crown Princess of Prussia and Princess Alice of Hesse Chloroform surgical instruments disin fectants waterproof goods tourniquets are the leading necessaries asked for We suppose that Liebigs extract hydrate of chloral and opium may be counted also in the front rank Great supplies of charpie and rags have been forwarded The Committee give to each surgeon an allowance of Li a day partly to pay their expenses and partly to enable them to procure for their patients such comforts as are not to be found in a military hospital Dr Frank is the chief repre sentative of the Society in Paris three of the surgeons are near Chalons two at Metz and two in Paris AID TO THE SICK AND WOUNDED THE Pharmaceutical 7ournal has appealed to the numerous members of the influential Society of which it is the organ to afford assistance in kind to the societies for aid of the sick and wounded in the war The appeal is timely and wellplaced and we do not doubt that they will respond as liberally on this occasion to the appeal from their own journal as they did on a former occasionthe heroic war of liberation by Garibaldito a private appeal to relieve the necessities of the wounded volunteers who fought in the cause of Italian freedom Among the drugs most needed will of course be carbolic acid hydrate of chloral opium and chloroform but all hospital necessaries will be needed in bulk to relieve the dreadful sufferings of the mass of men now suffering from wounds or sickness LieutColonel Loyd Lindsay has addressed this week a letter to the Pharmaceutical 7ournal thank ing it for its appeal and giving a list of articles required as agreed on by Dr Sieveking and Mr Pollock DRESS OF SURGEONS AND DRESSERS SEVERAL instances on both sides are reported in which surgeons and dressers have been fired upon and killed It is suggested perhaps with reason that this is due to the difficulty of distimguishing them from many combatants from whom they differ but little in uniform It is recommended that  surgeons hospital attendants and ambulance men should be dressed in some unmilitary uniform of a conspicuous colour say for instance the bright yellow formerly worn in the Spanish army a colour no longer worn in any army in Europe The idea seems good although the colour will probably not be approved Modest men however steeled by scientific carelessness of costume would feel uncomfortable nowadays in a canarycoloured dress and a more sober means of distinguishing them might easily be selected In time of war indeed extraordinary expedients are suggested but regimental sur geons walking about the streets in yellow coats would probably know no peace This Spanish uniform is at present worn we believe by one division of the ragbrigade who would possibly join the gutterboys generally in resenting the arbitrary adoption of this colour by the Army Medical Department MATERIAL RATHER THAN MONEY IT seems incredible says the Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift but from all quarters especially the German hospitals and ambulances the complaint reaches us of want of material for dressing the wounded and for treating and supporting the sick It would almost seem as if governments and war ministers took care for the provision of the means of destroying wounding and maiming and treated charpie com presses and surgical aid as quite of secondary value And if this want is apparent at the commencement of a war what must it become after weeks or months It is almost the exception for the aidsocieties to send to the belligerent powers material and not money Money has been liberally supplied for the wounded but of what use is it if it is impossible to buy medicines charpie bandages wine and other neces saries on the spot where they are wanted The Austrian patriotic helpunion has turned its attention in the first place and chiefly to the sending of material both to the French and to the German armies  from both sides it has received the warmest expressions of gratitude and requests for further aid of the same kind It would only be a matter of simple humanity if other societies would apply themselves more to the sending of material than of money ACTION OF THE ITALIAN AIDCOMMITTEES THE Italian Committees for aiding the sick and wounded in war have placed themselves in communication with the central office at Basle Those of Padua and Milan have forwarded to that place supplies of every kind Arrangements for doing the same tliing at Florence are being made and the Turin Committee has provided ambulances and placed them at the disposal of the central committee whose instruc tions as to their destination are expected DR MOSETIG formerly assistant of Baron von Dumreicher will pro bably go to the seat of war in France as a delegate from the Austrian Society for mutual help THE Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift learns with deep regret that the Austrian foreign ministry has declared it inopportune to comply with the proposal of the ministry of war to allow military surgeons to be sent to Prussia and France and placed at the disposal of each power for service in the military hospitals DR MAYO one of the medical men whom we last week mentioned as having been sent by the National Aid Society to Germany has telegraphed from DarmstadtHave seen Princess Alice Am going forthwith with party towards Metz Instruments much needed pro bably surgeons Send cases of instruments tourniquets and 201b of chloroform to me here Mark  Immediate with large red cross Pray continue to give us your aid MR SIMONS NEW REPORT THE Twelfth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Coun cil will be shortly in the hands of the profession It is one of consider able interest and importance It deals with the recent epidemics of re lapsing fever and scarlatina the dryearth system of treating nightsoil and the midden and its allied systems used in some northern towns the watersupply the use of milk of diseased cows the transmission of dis ease by vaccination animal vaccination as practised on the continent the Pharmacy Act and other subjects In respect to relapsing fever though there have been cases in other parts of the country the reporter confines himself to giving an account of the metropolitan epidemic He observes that it is a disease almost unknown in England but as far back as the middle of i868 there were precursory symptoms of such an epidemic It was not till the autumn of I869 that it became an accomplished fact Mr Simon calls atten tion to the memorandum to which we referred at the time for the guiidance of local authorities and gives the following short account of the epidemic The admissions of relapsing fever in the London Fever Hospital in October had numbered 130 in November they were 259 in December 315 Here perhaps strictly speaking my statements on the subject ought to cease as my report formally relates only to the business of i869 but probably I shall be excused for adding the more satisfactory experience of the first three months of I870 After Christmas the dis ease increased in the district of Holborn with Clerkenwell and in the parish of St Saviours Southwark and appears to have attained at the beginning of the year its chief extension over the poorer parts of London In January the cases of relapsing fever admitted into the London Fever Hospital were 258 in February the London Fever Hospital together with the newly opened Hampstead Hospital re ceived I53 cases only in March they received I40 At the present date March 3Ist I870 the two hospitals contain 103 cases of relapsing fever the disease is on the wane and the months of winter during which such infections are particularly apt to spread among the poor have happily now passed with comparatively a trifling epidemic The mortality was very low out of 769 cases treated in I869 in the London Fever Hospital only 17 werefatal Reference is then made to the Diseases Prevention Act of 1865 and to the working of the Metropolitan Asylums Act of 1867 and Mr Simon says of the former that though it has only been passed fifteen years it had even in a crisis such as that of i869 to be treated as Three Cases Of CerebroSpinal Fever Treated With AntipyrinAuthors E Carrick FreemanSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2160 May 24 1902 pp

still seems that opinions are by no means unanimous as to the worth of the test in the diagnosis of this disease  and it has certainly been proved that the reaction occurs in maladies other than enteric fever of which diseases tuberculosis is the most important Acting on the above principles I have examined the urine in 125 cases of all kinds and descriptions for the diazoreaction The cases have not been selected in any way but the process has been applied in the outpatient room and the result noted I Of these 125 cases in which the urine was examined 5 only gave a positive reaction In 120 instances no result whatever was obtained Amongst those patients whose urine gave a negative result were instances of diseases of the lung of various kindsphthisis heart disease gastric ulcer bronchitis etc The 5 cases were classified as follows  One was a case of acute tonsillitis another of lobular pneumonia two were cases of enteric fever in an early stage and one was suffering  from acute tuberculosis The last patient was thought at first to have enteric fever and this from a general consideration of history and symptoms The occur rence of a positive reaction with the colour test not unnaturally tended to strongly strengthen this view of the nature of the case Nevertheless the event proved that the diagnosis was I incorrect Thus the diazoreaction broke down just at the very point when it would be of the greatest possible use The extreme difficulty even the impossibility of differenti I ating typhoid fever from tuberculosis is generally admitted and it is unfortunate that this test so promising in many ways should fail us in making a very important and difficult diagnosis Three other cases of enteric fever were carefully tested but they all gave negative results These cases were all in a more or less advanced stage of convalescence which does not however render the occurrence of the reaction in any degree unlikely for many cases are recorded in which the result was positive months after the attack of enteric fever had been recovered from I have also subsequent to the above observations made many examinations of the urine of patients suffering from typhoid fever for the purpose of finding the diazoreaction Speaking generally I have found that at some period of the fever the result was nearly always positive and this usually at an advanced stage of the maladythat is to say at the end of the second or early in the third week Positive results were always most freely obtained when the temperature was high and the symptoms severe in other words they were always most obvious in wellmarked and anxious cases The result of my observations so far as regards enteric fever is that the diazoreaction is of little or no use in a practical sense And this because it does not occur at a stage I of the malady at which alone difficulties can really arise the early stage Further the liability of a positive reaction to recur in cases of tuberculosis is a most serious drawback and one which alone would tend to render the test valueless As regards the 125 cases there was not once a positive reaction in the very numerous instances of gout and anaemia and the same applies to diabetes It has been stated that in phthisis the reaction only shows itself in those patients in whom the malady is far advanced and that therefore the fact of its occurrence should be regarded as a danger signal My experience of the diazoreaction in phthisis is not large but I have had the opportunity of applying the test in very advanced cases of the disease My results do not in any way agree with those which would mark the diazoreaction cither as of usual occurrence in the later phases of the malady or when it does occur as being of any special significance In ordinary cases of this description theresult was negative and when the reaction was positive there was no reason whatever to suppose that the case offered any special feature of gravity beyond that which is usual at the stage at which the affection had arrived It is worthy of note too in this connexion that the case referred to above of acute tuberculosis which was at first thought to be one of enteric fever although showing a wellmarked positive reaction yet some months later was in no worse condition the disease not having made rapid progress My experience then of the diazoreaction is that from a strictly practical point of view it is of very little value When the result is positive in enteric fever the malady is so far advanced that there can be no possibility of error as regards the diagnosis In the very early stage when alone there may be some little difficulty in determining the nature of the malady the test usually gives negative results and even if this is not the case the positive reaction by no means excludes the possibility of the case being one of tuberculosis In my judgement far too much importance is at the present time attached to laboratory tests in clinical medicine A reversion to the oldfashioned but sound though laborious manner of acquiring a knowledge of the symptoms and physical signs of disease is greatly to be wished for it is by the cultivation of the senses at the bedside and in the dead house and in this way only that a real and satisfactory knowledge of medicine can be obtained THREE CASES OF CEREBROSPINAL FEVER TREATED WITH ANTIPYRIN By Major E CARRICK FREEMAN RAMC Hospital for Prisoners of War Ports Island Bermuda By the kind permission of the Senior Medical Officer of Ber muda I am enabled to publish the following cases of infective meningitis in the hope that further trial may be given to the treatment of this very fatal disease by antipyrin The disease broke out under the following circumstances  The transport Montrose left Durban for Bermuda on August nth 1901 having on board a detachment of 2nd Royal Warwickshire Regiment and Boer prisoners of war of whom including some embarked at Capetown there were nearly 1000 The Mont rose is a large roomy ship with particularly airy troop decks the height between decks being greater than usual and she is furnished with large portways for cattle opening outward on each deck which were kept open the greater part of the voyage The prisoners of war embarked at Durban were recently captured many of them emaciated and debilitated from the hardships of the field  their clothes were dirty and scabies and pediculosis very prevalent Old men and young boys were included and all were suffering from mental depression natural under the circumstances The Capetown contingent having been some time at Green Point were in much better condition Measles broke out at the commencement of the voyage as well as pneumonia of a particularly virulent type 39 cases with 13 deaths  influenza also ran through the ship None of the troops it may be mentioned contracted pneumonia and only one measles The weather was wet and cold from Durban half way to St Vincent afterwards mild and occasionally hot The prison ers were not overcrowded having more space than would be assigned to troops on a transport but they stayed below as much as possible and being accustomed to the veld felt the confinement of the ship a good deal They were well fed and suffered little from seasickness The first case of infective meningitis occurred on August 19th and was rapidly fatal the patient being brought into hospital in a comatose condition The next casethat of J de C described belowwas on August 23d The third and fourth cases were among the patients isolated for measles and both died on September ist after two and three days illness The fifth and sixth cases H J C and N de B were admitted on August 31st and their cases are given in detail No further cases occurred and on September ist the Montrose reached St Vincent between which port and Bermuda there was but little sickness of any kind The first third and fourth cases were treated on ordinary lines and proved rapidly fatal  the remaining three cases were treated from the outset with antipyrin and of these two as will be seen from the following notes recovered Case 1J de C Transvaaler aged iq was admitted to hospital on the ss Montrose August 23rd in a semicomatose condition continually cry ing out and complaining of intense pain about the nape of the neck Temperature 103 Antipyrin gr x was ordered at once and to be con tinued thrice daily By the 26th the temperature had fallen

having relapsed with a temperature of 1028 and intense cervical pain The pain rapidly diminished under this treatment and the temperature pursued an irregular course with a maximum of 10440 on September 6th and 9th On September 14th on the arrival of the Montrose at Bermuda the patient was transferred to the hospital for prisoners of war Ports Island Although every care was taken he re lapsed after transfer complaining of cervical pain  vomiting also super vened and was very troublesome The temperature becoming normal on September 21st antipyrin was discontinued and champagne given He now improved steadily vomiting ceased and appetite returned and he was able to sit up The bowels acted on alternate days with an occasional purgative On October 3rd he complained of inability to pass his urine and a catheter was used until the nth when the power of micturition HE m iw m s  a sa m suddenly returned On the 12th he again complained f intense pain in the neck and consequent insomnia lying with his head depressed and turned to the left and groaning constantly  these symptoms were at once relieved by antipyrin and an icebag On the 16th some constipation set in which was with difficulty relieved by purgatives and enemata On September 30th he complained for the first time of general headache and he again had an attack of  cerebral  vomiting Symptoms were not improved by sodium bromide but relieved by antipyrin His tempera ture now continued normal his appetite good he slept fairly well and had occasional attacks of vomiting occasional cephalalgia occasional exacerbations of cervical pain until his death which occurred suddenly without rigor or convulsion on November 21st the ninetyfirst day of his illness No necropsy was permitted Throughout the case there was no inequality of pupils Rigidity and stiffness of the cervical muscles was very marked also photophobia and partial ptosis of the right eyelid Case iiH J C Transvaaler aged 13 was admitted to hospital on the ss Montrose on August 31st in a semicomatose condition constantly crying out forwater and complaining of pain in the back of the head and neck The temperature was ioo reaching 1026o next day Antipyrin gr v ter die was ordered and continued steadily throughout the case The temperature pursued an irregular course ultimately falling by lysis  the  hydrocphalie cry was most marked  restlessness and photophobia in a less degree  the neck was stiff and tender He remained in a condi M UlXIXk m Z0 I i 1 m vV  WMAAM i tion of semistupor until after transfer to Ports Island Hospital on Sep tember 14th All cervical pain having disappeared antipyrin was discon tinued on September 21st The patient was thin weak and anaemic but made an uninterrupted recovery rapidly putting on flesh He was dis charged from the hospital on October 19th his mental faculties appearing in no ways impaired He liad however wellmarked strabismus The bowels acted regularly throughout there was no inequality of the pupils Case hiN de B Transvaaler aged 15 was also admitted on August 31st in a semicomatose state complaining of pain in the head and neck His temperature was 102o reaching 105o in the evening Calomel was given and antipyrin gr v ter die ordered and continued throughout the case Patient was very restless complaining of the light and when not asleep constantly crying out Doctor doctor or Water water Cervical rigidity was well marked On September 6th the left parotid was swollen and tender and two days later the right was in the same condi tion The patient became extremely weak and from September 10th to 13th all evacuations were involuntary On the 14th he was transferred to Ports Island being very restless constantly crving out Tem perature 1046 On September 18th two large boils on the back were incised On September 20th fluctuation being distinct both parotids were opened and a large quantity of pus evacuated and the abscesses drained The temperature fell to 99o On the 21st there was slight rise of temperature and some vomiting On the 24th the patient although very deaf seemed for the first time to understand what was said to him and from this point onward began to make steady progress On October 4th a large gluteal abscess was opened On October 15th he had a relapse his temperature rising to 104o to 05 and pain in the neck returning Antipyrin which had been discontinued since September 22nd was ordered and continued until September 20th by which time he was again convalescent Recovery was now uninterrupted and the patient discharged from hospital on December 13th There was no in equality of pupils  there was wellmarked squint during convalescence but it disappeared before the patient left hospital Day of M cent Am m  s p n v  52 m AMAAy To sum up  Of the 6 cases of infective meningitis on the ss Montrose 3 were treated in the ordinary way and died  3 were treated with antipyrin and of these 2 recovered  and 1 lived ninety days The outbreak was not confined to one part of the ship  2 cases were from the upper and 2 from the lower troop deck and 2 from the infectious ward which was at near the hospital The causation of infective meningitis or cerebrospinal fever is still uncertain but the modern view that it may be due to infection of the meninges by different pathogenic germs receives support from the outbreak under consideration when measles pneumonia and influenza were all present and from the occurrence of parotid and other abscesses in the case of J de C It is also confirmed by the case of an orderly St John Ambulance Brigade who being in good health scrubbed out a ward in one of the hospital buildings in Bloemfontein which had been long and closely occupied with enteric cases and died in three or four day with all the symptoms of acute cerebral meningitis MEMORANDA MEDICAL SURGICAL OBSTETRICAL THERA PEUTICAL PATHOLOGICAL Etc MALIGNANT SMALLPOX FATAL WITHIN SIX HOURS On April 8th I was called about 8 am to visit a boy aged ic weeks and I saw the child within half an hour The case seemed a very peculiar one The whole face was covered with a subcutaneous haemorrhagic rash or purpura But besides this there was a rash slightly elevated on the surface which closely resembled that of an ordinary case of measles and though that disease occurred to my mind I could at once see from the dusky skin and extreme prostration of the child that the disease was not measles but something of a far more serious character Beneath the jaw and around the neck were some halfdozen wellmarked red patches giving an appearance as if produced by touching the surface with the top of the finger dipped in blood There were as well some six or eight similar spots on the buttocks which were also covered with a subcutaneous mottling similar to that on the face The rest of the body at that time though of an ashy pale colour showed no rash of any kind The temperature was ioi The child was partly unconscious and groaned a if in pain I concluded that the case was one of malignant smallpox and I informed the relatives to that effect  but on this my first visit I was not without some doubt I asked my partner Dr Hine to visit the case and though he suspected smallpox he could not pronounce definitely I then sent a note to the medical officer of health for this district to inform him of the case and asked him to examine the child He went directly and after his visit he informed me that he thought the case an extraordinary one and that he would not then wish to decide whether it was smallpox or not As it was the first case of suspected smallpox occurring in the district Royal Commission On Physical Training In ScotlandSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2181 Oct 18 1902 pp 1257125820273949 1214 Oct i8 1902COMMISSION ON PHYSIOAL TRAININGmSLSSii I257 ROYAL COMMISSION ON PHYSICAL TRAINING IN SCOTLAND This Commission which had held its former sittings in London in private has recently conducted its investigations in Edinburgh and Glasgow under the chairmanship of the Earl op Mansfield Representatives of the press were admitted A large number of witnesses were examined including masters of schools of every grade and various denominations  officers of His Majestys Army of municipalities and of the Boys Brigade university professors medical officers of i health and constables The evidence was virtually unani mous in favour of extended physical education the diver gences of opinion had to do mainly with the form which this should take and the practicability of rendering it com pulsory The first witness was Dr Almond who has been Headmaster of Loretto since 1862 He was not in favour of a uniform castiron system of physical or any other training in schools He believed rather in exercises which would fit a lad for military life than in soldier work done at school  he thought that a great deal more rifleshooting was advisable He stated that during the thirty years or so in which the school had kept physical records there had been a gain of fully an inch in the chest girth of the boys admitted a result which he attributed to greater attention now paid in preparatory schools to outdoor exercises Dr Almond considered that football was of great value in promoting the military spirit while golf was a selfish game which did not cultivate the moral or social qualities He thought that the ordinary cadet uniform was too tight across the chest and too cumbrous and had obtained permission from the War Office to substitute a simple Norfolk jacket for it at Loretto Mr Roderick Ross Chief Constable of Edinburgh said that juvenile crime in Edinburgh was steadily increasing He was in favour of organized games in the parks MajorGeneral Sir Ian Hamilton insisted that though physical training was invaluable it depended for its full effect upon a full stomach  the satisfactory result obtained in the army was in his opinion in some measure due to the regular hours and wholesome food He was strongly in favour of attending to the physical aptitudes of the Scottish youth not only in the Stateaided schools but also for some time after leaving school He ardently wished to see physical training made compulsory not only in the curriculum of the schools but also as a continuation training He said that the Boer lads of from 12 to 15 were young vipers and had sent many a good man to his account and he saw no reason why under favourable conditions Scottish boys of 15 should not make useful soldiers General Hamilton did not anticipate any difficulty from religious bias as he believed that the Church of Scotland would be quick to realize that physical training with a military tendency would afford many of the advantages and none of the disadvantages of conscription He hoped in fact that the press and the ministers would recommend the people to give this scheme a fair trial He was strongly of opinion that physical exercises in the continuation classes should be compulsory otherwise the unruly and dissipated element which it was particu larly desirable to secure would escape Sir Ian Hamil ton went on to compare the English and German cadets whomhe had inspected within three weeks of each other at Sandhurst and Potsdam respectively The latter were in his opinion infinitely belter in all their exercises though eighteen months to two years younger than the Sandhurst corps Although he believed our native qualities to be better than those of the Germans the system of physical training which the latter had to undergo was far superior to our own  some of the exercises too wer specially devised to test their nerve He considered that drill was a better training than games because in the latter it was next to impose i ble to really test a boys progress Professor Bower of the University of Glasgow spoke of the great difficulties under which athletics were there carried on Many students were deterred from joining the clubs by the expense of the subscriptions  others were prevented from playing owing to the extent of the curriculum the time table of which left them no leisure for games As a result their physique was generally poor and this bid fair to become worse as it was about to become necessary for the univeraity to build upon the athletic ground Personally he attached so much importance to physical training as to consider it a necessity Dr H J Spenser Rector of the Glasgow High School  strongly advocated the formation of cadet corps or similar military organizations wherever possible both on national and moral grounds He stated that the difference between the English and Scotch boy was that while the former was encouraged to play games the latter had in many cases to encounter parental prejudice and opposition on this point Mr W Cecil Laming Rector of Kelvinside Academy con sidered that the Government ought to encourage and improve rifle shooting by members of cadet corps He was of opinion that from a moral point of view football was of greater im portance than either gymnastics or military drill Mr George S Deverell Superintendent of the Clyde training ship Empress said that he thought the physical training of the class of boys who came under his care was of equal importance with their mental training He urged that for their own benefit and that of the eountry every boy and girl should be compelled to learn and pass a certain standard of gymnastica before being allowed to leave school Mr W L Caine Headmaster of George Watsons College Edinburgh complained that the physical training of his boys was hampered by the exigent demands of the Education Department Mr Edwin Temple Rector of Glasgow Academy advocated compulsory drill and thought that all boys between the ages of 12 and 18 should be taught how to handle a rifle This would obviate the introduction of conscription which he thought impossible in the form in which it existed in France and Germany The Lord Provqst of Glasgow stated that the number of youths between the ages of 12 and 21 annually convicted at the policecourts of that city was on the increase the majority of the culprits showed poor physical development He did not think compulsion in the way of physical training possible but suggested that much improvement would result if direct instruction in behaviour to one anotherwere given to school children He thought that if the school playgrounds were left open for their use many loafers might be induced to desert the streets Mr Thomas W Cuthbertson Secretary of the Boys Brigade referred to the physical advantages achieved by his organization with good results to the morals of the lads He did not think it advisable that physical training should be made compulsory in continuation schools as many of the scholars had been doing hard physical work all day Miss Mary Anderson Headmistress of Ferguslie HalfTime School Paisley was of opinion that physical training was so important that it ought to be increased by taking half an hour off arithmetic Canon Mackintosh and other principals of Roman Catholic institutions were heartily in favour of physical training which they thought should be canied out by the ordinary teachers of the school wherever possible They did not all think it advisable to make this compulsory It was stated that many of the Roman Catholic parents were in favour of volunteering but opposed to soldiering Mr R E Thomas Chief Instructor in Physical Exercises under the Leeds School Board stated that over 50000 scholars in that city received physical instruction and those in the upper standards VI and VII were also taught to swim He considered that physical training was better than games for im proving the general standard as opposed to the development of individuals Great care must be exercised in the selection of the method of training  both Swedish and military drill were too severe if unmodified Dr R W Bruce Medical Officer to the Glasgow School Board pointed out that if physical training were made com pulsory a general medical inspection would be desirable Sir William Turner had no hesitation in stating that physical exercise was of the highest importance in connexion with the development of the body generally A certain period of each day should be set aside for body training so that the best use might be made of the mind Other witnesses referred to the value of manual training in m38 MwoJBfiRIBEBI IN THE BER CAMP ST HELENATQct S 1902 the education of feebleminded and infirm children and to the physical training system mainv on military lines which was so thoroughly carried out in Swiss schools THE EPIDEMIC OF BERIBERI IN THE BOER CAMP AT ST HELENA In reference to Dr Patrick Mansons paper on the prophy laxis and treatment of beriberi being the opening contribu  tion to the discussion on beriberi in the Section of Tropical Diseases at the Manchester meeting1 Dr W A Wheeler Civil Surgeon in Charge of the Boer Camp in St Helena has described his experiences of the epidemic of this disease which occurred among the Boers there The facts as he jbelieves fully agree with Dr Mansons theory as to the pro duction of the disease by place infection  At first only a few isolated cases of beriberi occurred in the campt Dead Wood Plain but at the time of his arrival there in May 1902 the disease had become epidemic and a new isolation camp was established of which he had com mand and in which he had on an average 75 cases to treat In regard to etiology Dr Wheeler believes that all the causes ordinarily ascribed might be eliminated As far as alcoholism was concerned the Boers were well known to be a temperate race and as prisoners of war they had no possible means of obtaining alcoholic drinks and every man re turning to camp after leave of absence was strictly searched Rice was at no time issued as partof the rations Arsenic was carefully tested for in the drinking water with a negative result and if any had been present in tinned foods the home troops would have suffered equally as the rations for soldiers and Boers were identical Malaria was ordinarily unknown in St Helena and although it was common in someparts of South Africavet careful questioning of each patient in no case elicited a history of this disease On the other hand the conditions existing among the Boers would lend great countenance to the theory of place infec tion resulting in the development of a toxin outside the body The Boers had been confined to one camp of 3000 men for over two years The greatest care was taken as regards drainsge latrines removal of night soil etc but even so the grouud could not possibly have escaped being fouled during this long time Again the large majority of those attacked were old men so to 70 men who in their own country had been accustomed to a free active life but who now as prisoners moped took no exercise ate and slept too much and stayed mostly day and night in small huts with every aperture closed They never washed their bodies and never changed their clothes Conr ditions such as these in conjunction with fouled ground would naturally bring about a state of affairs favourable to the production of a toxin The mosquito could be eliminated in this case for the camp was at an elevation of 2000 ft and a strong sea breeze was constantly blowing Dr Wheeler had never seen a mosquito there but vermin of other kinds were there in plenty The theory of place infection was also strongly borne out by the fact that on moving the invalids to a site hitherto unoccupied a most rapid and marvellous improvement took place The earlier cases had been sent to Jamestown Station Hospital at sea level and a fair number of these died  but 41ter the establishment of the isolation camp at Dead Wood Plain there was not a single death every man recovered cjinpletely some in a weekor so others more slowly The treatment consisted solely in this change of location and in giving extra diet 1 tin of milk 2 oz of oatmeal and 3 oz of whisky to each man As regards the ordinary diet it was at no time deficient  and was identical with that of the home troops encamped on the same groundnamely fresh meat four days a week tinned meat two days vegetables and potatoes on alternate daysbread sugar and coffee It is true the vegetables were compressed and the potatoes were often not too good With regard to the water supply  on careful analysis this  was found to be rather suspicious  both free and albuminoid  ammonia were too high and there was too much chlorides  it was however passable However after the outbreak of beri  beri among the Boers and of enteric among our troops only distilled water was supplied  With regard to the clinical symptoms  every case with two exceptions was of the dropsical variety and in many cases there was rapid oedema of the scrotum and penis The scrotum often swelled so enormously as to require punctures There was no retention no albuminuria no marked anaemia no marked paralysis except in two cases mentioned above  but always numbness and often complete anaesthesia of the legs great pain over the tibiae and the sternum and in the worst cases dyspnoea Appetite was good and the bowel functions normal The spleen was not enlarged In about 30 per cent of the cases the gums were spongy and the calves of the legs hard The two exceptional cases showed marked ataxic symptoms rapid emaciation and a lemon tint of the skin like that of pernicious anaemia But these also recovered entirely The following points were of most importance as bearing on the question of place infection 1 Nearly all the patients were old men 50 to 70 worn out by hardships and mental anxiety  2 the proverbial dislike of ordinary Boer to clean liness and ventilation 3 the prolonged residence on the same camping ground though the sanitation and food and water supply were carefully looked after  4 the total absence of any similar disease among the home troops encamped on adjacent land equally crowded sleeping on bare ground but accustomed to bathing parades and by nature cleanly  5 the epidemic of enteric among the troops at the same time as the outbreak of beriberi occurred among the Boers  6 the marked recovery of even the most acute cases after their re moval to fresh ground and the addition to the ordinary diet as compared with the considerable mortality among those at first sent to Jamestown   Colonel Williamson PMO Capetown laid considerable stress on the fact that 26 out of 78 cases then in the beriberi camp had come from the Potchefstrom district of the Trans vaal where a mild form of beriberi was supposed to be endemic But it is hardly likely that a man could carry a latent disease for three years In regard to Dr Mansons observations on the relation between beriberi sleeping sickness and malaria Dr Wheeler writes After having been in constant attendance on the beriberi camp for two months I went down to Jamestown one day when I was not feeling very well having had sub acute malaria for a few days In Jamestown I remarked to another medical man that I had a severe pain in the calf of my right leg and jokingly said I believe I have got beri beri myself I did not feel inclined for lunch and walked back to camp a distance of six miles up an ascent of 2000 ft When I arrived home I collapsed completely went straight to bed and did not waken for twentyfour hours  then I slept again for three whole days without food or drink On the fourth day I wakened in hospital perfectly well except for slight numbness in the right arm and leg and pain in the wrists Drugs or alcoholism could be entirely excludedj I have always been strictly temperate and the causation puzzled everyone For myself I put it down to sheer exhaus tion but the paper referred to has suggested a possible con nection with beriberi I was never unconscious  only always wanted to sleep Three days of constant feeding made me absolutely well again in fact in better form than I had been for a long time  During a residence of six years in tea districts in India I have naturally seen a large number of cases of the disease known there as beriberi and of malaria in all its forms I have also as a visitor seen the form of beriberi common in Singapore but this epidemic in St Helena has exhibited features very different from those in the other countries The icutenees of the cases the rapid recovery on removal to fresh ground the absence of all factors hitherto considered causa uve with the notable exception of that of fouled ground and personal uncleanliness is most remarkable

relation between the two condi tions The presence of haemorrhages on the surface and in the substance of the iris showed that the arteriosclerosis was not limited to the retinal vessels but also affected the ciliary arteries this latter circumstance of course being a strong contraindication to performing iridectomy seeing that exten sive intraocular haemorrhage is so likely to occur under these conditions The clinical significance of this complication in cases of thrombosis naturally lies chiefly in the direction of prognosis which is really not at all bad in many cases of simple thromb osis the patients often retaining some useful vision after the reestablishment of the circulation and the absorption of haemorrhages The occurrence of acute glaucoma as a sequel however renders the prognosis extremely grave since these cases owing to the condition of the vessels are such that an iridec tomy does not afford much promise of success My thanks are due to the honorary

JOHN GRIMSHAW MDLond MRCSEng Etc Aldershot It is with pleasure that I read the annotation on spectacled soldiers which appeared in the British Medical Journal of September 21st 1901 A there are various points in it which have occupied my special att ention for a considerable time under favourable conditions for examining into and forming some opinions on this important question it may prove of interest if I describe briefly my experience and m a general way record a few impressions on the subject Of defective vision in soldiers as it has appealed to me For over eighteen months as civil surgeon attached to the Cambridge Hospital Aldershot I have had charge of the ophthalmic work of this hospital and as a part of my duties connected therewith it has fallen to my lot to examine and report upon for the medical officer in charge all cases of I defective vision reporting sick at this hospital This process i includes all cases sent to hospital from the various inspection rooms in South Camp for eye examination and report Further I reported on all soldiers admitted into the Cam bridge Hospital who were invalided home from South Africa on account of eye trouble of one kind or another This repre sents only a small portion of my ophthalmic work in hospital and camp but time does not allow me to deal with my entire ophthalmic experience here in anything like a comprehensive and exact manner After some time when I fell into the routine work of the military medical system I recognised the great importance of this subject of defective vision in its relation to voluntary enlistment and to the efficacy of the man as a fighting unit after enlistment For the last twelve months therefore I have kept complete copies of my reports and it has been my aim to make each report minutely and accurately represent the true state of the eye examined I worked out the refrac tion of each eye by retinoscopy after application of hom atropine cum cocaine and afterwards checked the results and the ability of the soldier to answer correctly by examination with test types and trial lenses All other methods of routine eye examination were used by me in every case so that I could conscientiously say on occasion  no cause for defec tive vision can be found It is only those perhaps who have like myself seen the wearying and nerveshattering effects of the  scrimshankers importunity upon the responsible medical officer who can realise the value of this moral support when appealed to in the hour of trial  Are you sure there is nothing wrong with this mans eyes Mr  The amount of material I have had at my disposal can be  judged by the following extract  The work carried out by the RAMC at Aldershot since the war commenced has been enormous but it has been accomplished with remark able success Some idea of this can be gathered from the fact that during the year 1900 over iooco patients passed through the wards of the Cambridge Hospital alone and over 3 000 of these were sick and wounded from South Africa 1 find that in the last twelve months I have written some 250 reports of the kind described on cases of defective vision for the medical officer in charge of the Cambridge Hospital These reports I may add are forwarded by this officer to the principal medical officer attached to the invaliding documents of those patients whom I have recommended for discharge on account of visual disabilities The cases of ametropia were  Hypermetropia  3D and under small error of  1 disre garded  34  Over  3 D  54 Total of hypermetropia   88  Of these 88 cases 42 had more or less marked astigmatism Myopia 3D and under small error of  x disregarded   16  Over 3D 15 Total of myopia  3t t Of these 31 cases 16 had astigmatism Mixed Astigmatism 17 Total cases ot ametropia   136 Presbyopia  12 Total 148 i34 mwSSUOPHTHALMIC WORK IN THE ARMY Jan ifr 1902 Among nonrefractive or complicating morbid conditions were  i Leukoma common 2 Sequelae of old iritis com monnamely anterior synechiae anterior capsular opacities with more or less occlusion of pupil posterior synechi asin cluding cases of total posterior synechiae with exclusion of pupil followed by softening and shrinking of globe and com plete loss of sight The majority of the latter iritic class and all the destruction of globe cases were in soldiers invalided home from South Africa 3 Cataracts rare 4 Vitreous opacities common 5 Fundus changes rare including optic neuritis several of which according to medical history sheet followed enteric in South Africa choroiditis and choroidal haemorrhages  ruptured choroid  detached retina including a remarkable case caused by lightning stroke a de scription of which was read by Major Yarr before the Ophthalmological Society I would here like to draw attention to the number of cases sent to me diagnosed conjunctivitis which were really cases of iritis and to the frequency with which I see sequelae of neglected cases of iritis in synechiae etc as above de scribed On several occasions I have just been in time to prevent dire consequences of mistaken diagnosis or in efficient treatment by frequent applications of atropine Moreover I have reason to believe that an error of refraction especially astigmatism and hypermetropia is liable to lead to a mistaken diagnosis of optic neuritis For example I will quote a case at present in my wards Sergt P invalided home from South Africa suffering from defective vision the result of optic neuritis following an attack of enteric medical history sheet Retinoscopy reveals simple myopic astigma tism in each eye but no signs of optic neuritis or other morbid change in fundus or elsewhere On examination with trial lenses  RV TV c  1 D cyl axis vert   LV do To help me to avoid certain pitfalls of eye work on entering general practice I regularly carried a little box in my vest pocket containing discs of atropine for iritis cocaine for cornea foreign bodies etc eserine for glaucoma and homatropine c cocaine for retinoscopy and fundus examina tion To my box I have added fluorescin discs for corneal ulcers The benefits which have accrued to patient and self by the adoption of such aids to memory afford me sufficient excuse for mentioning my little device To all RAMC medical officers I would urge the invalu able help of retinoscopy in army ophthalmic work It is indispensable  nothing can replace it as an objective visual test easy of application I may say that many of the cases reporting sick were ordered to do so by their musketry instructor for defective vision revealed by bad shooting Trial by fire is a very excellent trial in more ways than one for the soldier and it serves better than any conventional rule of thumb visual tests to convert his latent defective vision into total manifest My cases prove either neglect of the medical examiner or his assistant to conform with War Office regulations or the inadequacy of the visual tests to serve as an effective barrier to the enlistment of recruits visually defective from ametropia or organic lesion Both causes operate in permitting a large number of men to enter the army who are unfit for it through visual defects whether of a nature to be corrected by glasses or not 1 Is the medical examination of recruits unsatisfactory under the present system or at any rate inefficiently per formed The following cases of ametropia selected from amongst many in my list would seem to point to an answer in the affirmative Private H ColourSergeant B 35 175 4 2 X X X   2  3 7 R L R amblyopic Private C 5  6 R

tests and they have replied in the following fashion   1 was never examined I tipped the recruiting sergeant I rushed through with the crowd  I guessed  them some how  I never did count the dots though examined Confronted with cases of the quality and quantity here re corded and by such explanatory statements made by men in the regular army I am able to sympathise with Lord Kitchener in his strictures passed upon the physical unfit ness of the Imperial Yeomanry and the troubles in which they involved him and his staff in South Africa With reference to the remark  I tipped the recruiting sergeant I may state that the recruiting sergeant receives 2S 6d for each recruit The addition of another 2S 6d as a dole from the anxious wouldbe Thos Atkins would surely make recruiting a lucrative and desirable form of occupation It will be seen therefore that it is to the recruiting sergeants advantage that the maximum number of his can didates be accepted by the medical examiner The tricks of the trade are well known and understood by the experienced officer For example the test dot card is held up before the candidate by the medical examiner whilst the assistant covers an eye It does not require a vivid imagination to understand the ease with which the number of dots can be conveyed by the assistant to the subject by a series of secret taps There are other tricks of legerdemain practised in the attempts to impose upon the examining surgeon which are worthy almost of a Maskelyne Even actual imperson ation of the proposed recruit is not unknown But 1 am afraid there is carelessness on the part of the medical exa miner of recruits and even criminal neglect on the part of him who rises superior to the testdot card and credulously asks the recruit  Are you all right   The present army sys tem must not be altogether exonerated from blame in the matter First in these days of recruiting difficulties it is to be feared that medical examiners believe that the quality of recruits must be subsidiary to quantity and that the adop tion of the principle of let em all come would be accept able to the recruiting authorities Secondly these responsible examinations as now arranged often fall upon civilian doctors or raw RAMC lieutenants who can scarcely be blamed for carrying their responsibility so lightly if through ignorance or inexperience they do not realise the immediate or farreaching results of carelessness of their recruiting actsa carelessness which will involve financial loss to the State by enforced discharge of semi trained men from the service and possibly disastrous losses on the field of action through imperfect shooting picketing or scouting The best way I think to prevent such unfortunate occurrences  in the examination of recruits would be to ap point consultative Boards of experienced RAMC officers specially skilled in the detection of disqualifying disabilities to examine recruits before final admission into the ranks  such a Board to have on eye matters at least an expert skilled by specialism in the visual disqualifications of recruits to whom all doubtful eye cases might be referred for report Private H  2 25 X 6 e R L Private C  7  X X  8 7 Private B 9 X j io  R and L Jan 18 1902 OPHTHALMIC WORK IN THE ARMY LmSS i3S Some such system would certainly have to be organised if the British Medical Journals suggestion of enlarging the meshes of the recruiting net were to be adopted for the ophthalmic expert would have to answer amongst other questions whether the fish caught were worth the curing  But at this stage we are confronted with the question of specialism by officers of the RAMC a question large and important the discussion of which does not come within the range of these reflections I need only say that such specialism is not only very desirable but absolutely neces sary if the multitudinous duties of the RAMC officers are to be performed in anything like an efficient and satisfactory manner 2 Are the visual tests sufficiently stringent  These V tests by means of the testdot card are as follows  A recruit for the regular army must be able to count these dots at a distance oi 10 feet Each eye must be examined separately These tests would pass a recruit for the regular army with VTV and reject one as unfit with V below ft This means that a degree of 175 myopia each eye would be accepted For the militia volunteers and the departmental corps V acuity represented by testdot card held at 5 feet instead of 10 feet is demanded Such a difference appears somewhat inconsistent when so many irregular troops are at present engaged on active service in South Africa It will be seen that the test will not exclude a hyper mtrope whose compensatory accommodation is unstable enough to break down by the least constitutional debility  and as a matter of fact I have many records in my notes of   I first noticed my eyes bad after enteric In consideration of this question it must be remembered that in shooting the eye has to be accommodated in rapid succession between the fore and back sights of the rifle and the target Even simple errors of refraction of 2 D to 3 D or 15 D will render this difficult This testdot card was introduced by Professor Longmore in i860 and was based by him on the work of German oculists No fresh edition of the test has been published by the War Office since 1870 when the then distance of 15 feet was re duced to 10 feet a modification which was demanded by the exigencies of recruiting The test is a rough and ready one and is very suitable for recruits who are unable to read It assumes that because a man can count dots at a distance of 10 feet which I would note is a totally different thing from seeing them with any sharpness of definition he can see a bullseye 3 feet diameter at 600 yards with sufficient precision to enable him to shoot at it with reasonable chances of success And in this assumption there are surely possible fallacies From testdots to targets from 10 feet to 600 yards from counting dots to shooting bulls are surely distances to leap which resemble somewhat impassable gulfs For be it ob served soldiers do not in active warfare shoot at white bulls or blackgrounds  they shoot at men often only part of a man and at men also who may be indistinguishable in colour from the ground on which they stand or lie Moreover it is un doubtedly true that the use of guns of such long range and precision in modern warfare demand keener visual acuity in the soldier than was formerly the case Most of the shooting I am told in the Boer war has approximated closely to ranges of 1000 and 2000 yards and even accurate shooting at shorter ranges is vastly more important now than it used to be in the old days of the bayonet For Lord Roberts has said that the bayonet is an obsolete weapon of attack and has been replaced in modern warf are by rifle fire within a zone of 200 to 600 yards and that in future battles will c teris paribus be won by armies which possess the best and straightest shots at this distance From Sir Redvers Buller we get the opinion that superiority of the Boers over us in this wearisome South Africa campaign is largely because of his superior distant vision Everyone therefore must admit the desirability for each recruit of the regular army to have the raw material of visual acuity in him lor the making of an efficient fighting unit which par excellence means a firstclass shot and a sharp eyed scout These visual tests are insufficiently stringent to serve in barring men from entering the army who do not possess that excellent vision necessitated by these two allimportant functions of the modern efficient soldier and my experience goes to prove that men in the army are waking up to the im portance of good vision as seen by their anxiety to have de lects corrected by glasses or otherwise Officers have con sulted me respecting their eyesight preparatory to going through their course of musketry at flythe who have had errors of refraction as low as  125 D and  15 D myopia A few days ago Lieutenant P RHA consulted me about his eyes He had recently returned from South Africa and when there

competition He said that the watering of his eyes affected his shooting I was able by operation to relieve his epiphora and to make his shooting more satisfac tory to him All these cases could count their dots at 10 feet with ease Telescopic sights are now used by the artillery and recently efforts have been made to perfect rifle fire by some such aid All guns small and large are made to fire with maximum accuracy at all ranges  yet correct shooting is still dependent upon good vision and but little attention is paid to this sub ject It still seems as if the question of whether a man is of certain height or chest measurement or whether he has vari cose veins overshadows the most important question of all Can he see well  By way of digression I may state that it is somewhat astonishing and perplexing to learn from soldiers who have returned from the front the frequency with which kopjes were targets and not Boers Fighting all day Sir and never saw a Boer  Yes Sir we simply blazed away at the hills on the chance of hitting a Boer or two Such remarks as these I have often heard from our invalided South Africans and they have compelled one to ask oneself the question whether in these days of smokeless powder and in the clear atmosphere of the veldt the eyes of our absentminded beggar  were not a little to blame in his failure to spot the Boer although cunningly entrenched Everyone also will I presume admit the necessity for the prompt discharge from the army of the man who through ametropia if this must remain uncorrected or organic lesion has ceased to be an efficient soldier Unfortunately these visual tests cut both ways in their application for  whatever visual disorder a NCO or soldier serving in the ranks may happen to contract so long as he is left with acuteness of vision equal to that for which recruits are tested he must be regarded as visually qualified for military duties Moreover as will be seen later the test imposed upon men who have suffered impairment of vision of one eye is more stringent in case of discharge than on entrance It follows therefore that if the visual tests are ineffective in barring men with unsuitable vision they will serve even in a greater degree to keep such undesirables in the army unless spectacles are allowed to correct the ametropes and the men are willing to wear them Enteric Fever In Sierra LeoneNot Yet Endemic With A Note On A Case Of Infection ThreeMonths After ContactAuthors F SmithSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2177

contact tafite By Major F Smith RAMC Sierra Leone Enteric fever has not been generally regarded as a Sierra Leone disease and as a matter of fact it is very rare indeed The object of this paper is to record the fact that enteric is among us to moot the question as to whether it is a new thing or not and to point out a danger which overhangs us in the shape of an extension of the disease Our insanitary sur roundings are likely to conduce to its establishment in Free town The city contains some 40000 inhabitants spread over a large area and the place is honeycombed with unsteined wells and cesspits the latter generally at a higher level than the former and within twelve yards distance A great part of the inhabitants do not yet use any common water supply These conditions are more likely to bring about an endemic state than to give rise to a sudden extensive epidemic It seems an extraordinary thing that enteric has not been more common in Sierra Leone considering that there is nothing to prevent it from travelling from the North of Africa where it is common or from South Africa where it has played such havoc with our soldiers Malaria has however been hitherto regarded as almost our only fever and the facts seem to justify this view The absence of records of enteric cannot be looked upon as being to any great extent due to cases having escaped the notice of medical men We have had skilful physicians here since the early part of last century men with experience of diseases of other countries and they are not likely to have all of them overlooked the existence of a malady having such marked characteristics No doubt many like myself have been on the lookout for it The following is a list of all the causes and suspected cases I have heard of  List of Cases of Enteric Fever and Suspected Cases in Sierra Leone from Bemote Times to May 1902 Noofl Case Date or Approximate Date Remarks 4 56 7 8 1892 Negro soldier of

end of attack and I suspected  enteric European Late in 1899 Native negro soldier reported by Dr Horrocks and i verified post mortem at Panguma far away in the  hinterland Case landed from a manofwar Died a few days later in the Colonial Nursing Home Dr Renner informs me that he had twosuspicious cases among the European residents Second quarter A West Indian negro woman in Freetown Two of 1901 attacks of haemorrhage Brought to my notice by Dr Latchmore West Indian negro soldier in Tower Hill Barracks Verified at necropsy Dec 190X A suspected case in a Freetown native Jan 1902 Ditto Feb 1902  Three native children living in one house in Freetown The diagnosis in Cases 11 and 12 is strengthened by the fact that the dried blood examined by Professor A E Wright in the laboratory of the Army Medical School at Netleygavea positive reaction in the agglutination test Eight of the 13 cases namely Nos 2 and 7 to 13 came under my personal observation Though there is no definite evidence of any connexion of these cases one with another the sequence of occurrence is such as to suggest relationship be tween Nos 2 and 3 also between No 7 and all those which followed except No 8 Case No 2 was in a man who had recently arrived from Egypt where enteric was rife He was taken ill almost im mediately after arrival in this country and while on service in the hinterland He was brought down through Panguma and stayed there two days in quarters in the barrack en closure in which case No 3 occurred a few months later Case No 7 is dealt with below but of those which followed No 8 was in a soldier in isolated barracks on a hill and was most likely connected with the arrival early in 1901 of some comrades who came from St Helena in the same ship which brought the case No 7 The remainder occurred on the same side of the town as No 7 but the houses were by no means near and there was no common water supply It is probable though that the clothing was washed in the same stream Dirty clothes in Sierra Leone are  taken to the brook  and washed in the pools which in the dry season are more or less stagnant but com municate by rivulets of running waterhot water is never used by our washerwomen These cases might of course have arisen out of Nos 2 4 5 or 6  or again out of unrecog nized cases from the hinterland Case No 7 bears on the question as to whether or no enteric fever is always waterborne The woman was in St Helena with her husband  she came to Sierra Leone in the middle of January on a transport which had carried soldiers and Boer prisoners from South Africa Towards the end of the follow ing April she developed enteric fever Her husband who came with her had not been ill neither had her only child or any one connected with the family The woman was in lodgings in the town where as before stated the disease is almost unknown No local source of infection could be dis covered There is little doubt that in this case the germs of infection came from St Helena or the transport The assumption then is that the infection was carried about on the person or belongings of the woman or some member of her family for some weeks before it found its way into her system It will be gathered from the remarks on the other cases that there is no certainty about the origin of this case No 7  but the rarity of the disease in Sierra Leone and the absence of evidence of other cases occurring in or near the house before this West Indian woman was attacked together with the im  portant point that she had recently come from an infected 1 place is strongly in favour ofA the theory that she brought the bacillus with her The serious fact in any case is that we have enteric fever in Sierra Leone  and it is well that all should know it in good time Our climate is bad enough already without the addi I tion of typhoid to our burdens THE CLIMATE AND DISEASES OF BANGKOK By P A

aroused to recognise their responsibilities in the matter and it is a little difficult to understand why the Secretary of State for War a couple of months ago put himself forward as the apologist for the administration of the camps The fjrst Blue Book on these camps Cd 819 presented to both Houses of Parliament by command of His Majesty November 1901 appears to have been compiled in South Africa in response to a request which the Secretary of State for War made to Lord Kitchener on March 18th 1901 in the following terms   Please send by next mail a dispatch giving full report on refugee camps in Cape Colony as well as Orange River Colony and Transvaal The rst report in the volume is made by Dr George Turner Medical Officer of Health Transvaal to Major General J G Maxwell Military Governor Pretoria and was transmitted by him to the CommanderinChief South Africa An extract from Army Orders South Africa March 7th 1901 sets out that the Military Governor Pre toria and the Deputy Adminstrator Orange River Colony will be responsible for the formation and maintenance of iburgher refugee camps In the Transvaal such camps will be administered by civilian superintendents under the general management of Major Goodwin Railway Pioneer Regiment General officers commanding and command ants are responsible only for the external protection of these camps and will afford the superintendents as much assistance as possible Lord Kitchener forwarded to the UnderSecretary of State for War reports on the camps in the Transvaal on March 22nd 1901 on those in the Orange River Colony and Natal on March 29th 1901 and on those in Cape Colony on May 10th 1901 The volume contains a eries of subsequent reports forwarded at various dates down to September 20th 1901 by Lord Kitchener to the War Office Many of the reports thus forwarded by the CommanderinChief in South Africa were from civilian officials but the Colonial Office and the Adminis trator Lord Milner make their appearance in this connec tion only in the second Blue Book Cd 853 from which it appears that at the end of September 1901 some corre spondence took place as to sending out matrons and as to shifting certain refugees to make room for others but attention appears first to have been given by Mr Chamber lain and Lord Milner to the prevention of the high mor tality then prevailing on November 8th 1901 The facts as to the divided control of the camps and the circumstance that the medical arrangements were under the civil admin istration must have been known to Mr Brodrick before Parliament was prorogued and it seems a most remark able circumstance that he did not make the position clear THE BOERS AND ENTERIC FEVER The great epidemic of enteric fever which occurred in the army at and about Bloemfontein early in 1900 was followed by a serious prevalence among the more scat tered forces in South Africa at the end of that year and the beginning of 1901 and the official returns for the last two months appear to indicate that the disease is again making its presence felt The number of deaths from disease in the Field Force South Africa which had been 142 in September and 136 in October rose in November to 236 and in December to 351 The causes of death are not indicated in the returns but relying upon previous experience it will be safe to assume that a very large pro portion of the deathsprobably about 80 per centhave been caused by enteric fever There has all along been good reason to believe that the Boer forces have not suffered to anything like the same extent from this scourge of South Africa and a piece of evidence on this head is found in a very interesting article in the current number of Blackwod The writer does not give his name but he states that he is of British nationality and before the war was a district surgeon under the late Transvaal Government He was ordered to join the local commando as medical officer and from early in October 1899 until February 1900 he was with the exception of three weeks with the Boer forces engaged in the unsuccessful siege of Mafeking The force he states at first numbered 6000 or 7000 but laterabout the middle of Novemberit was reduced to 2000 by the departure of Cronje for Kimberley After stating that the Boer wounded preferred to be treated in their waggons or tents in the laager rather than go to the hospital organised by a German lady Mrs Weiss MD he continues as follows The health of the laager was wonderfully good It would seem to an army medical man almost incredible but it is nevertheless true that in my laager on the Lower Malopo we never had a definite case of enteric and we were encamped on one spot without moving for two months and then only moved twenty or thirty yards farther down the reason of the move being to enable the waggons to be drawrf closer together for pur poses of defence In the new spot the laager remained certainly for another three or four months The oxen several hundred of them are fastened at night in the middle of the circle of waggons and tents and the horses also thus converting the whole space into a manureheap through which after a few nights no one would think of walking In the warm weather the manure contained myriads of maggots which in due time became myriads of flies The flies have often been described as they were just as bad in Natal  but to give some idea of their numbers I may mention that once whilst sipping a glass of claret I counted fifteen flies on my lipsall these flies and all this filth and yet no enteric  Of course the Boers now and then made efforts to clean up a little but the centre of the laager was not often passable on foot  also our water supply was not of the best We got all our water from the Malopo a muddy little ditch 6 to 10 feet wide in most places which had already passed through the upper Zeerust laager and also through Mafeking naturally receiving a certain amount of sewage in its course through the town There were 2 deaths not in my laager that I know of reported as  fever which might have been enteric but were I believe generally considered to be malarial  at any rate granting that all deaths from sick ness about 8 or 10 at the outside round Mafeking during the siege were from enteric even then any will confess that they were wonderfully few How this comparative immunity is to be accounted for is not clear It has been suggested that the majority of Boers have suffered from enteric fever in childhood an age at which the dis ease is as a rule milder than in adult life and the official accounts of the habits of the Boer women in the refugee camps certainly lend some colour to the opinion On the other hand it would appear that the Boers are not much in the habit of drinking water and that their usual bever age is coffee The boiling of the water for making the coffee may be thought of as a reason why enteric fever has been comparatively rare among them LOCAL TREATMENT IN THE UPPER AIR PASSAGES There are certain regions of the body which for no obvious reason are frequent battle grounds for controversialists It is mostly one of the natural orifices of the body that is the centre of disturbance and the conflict as a rule rages the more fiercely the narrower the field in which it is fought Within the past few months several illustrations of this general proposition have been given in the British Medical Journal Whether these controversies tend on the whole to edification may perhaps be doubted but until philosophy has softened the manners of men they must be looked upon as regrettable incidents in the vic torious march to the conquest of truth

to the physical training system mainv on military lines which was so thoroughly carried out in Swiss schools THE EPIDEMIC OF BERIBERI IN THE BOER CAMP AT ST HELENA In reference to Dr Patrick Mansons paper on the prophy laxis and treatment of beriberi being the opening contribu  tion to the discussion on beriberi in the Section of Tropical Diseases at the Manchester meeting1 Dr W A Wheeler Civil Surgeon in Charge of the Boer Camp in St Helena has described his experiences of the epidemic of this disease which occurred among the Boers there The facts as he jbelieves fully agree with Dr Mansons theory as to the pro duction of the disease by place infection  At first only a few isolated cases of beriberi occurred in the campt Dead Wood Plain but at the time of his arrival there in May 1902 the disease had become epidemic and a new isolation camp was established of which he had com mand and in which he had on an average 75 cases to treat In regard to etiology Dr Wheeler believes that all the causes ordinarily ascribed might be eliminated As far as alcoholism was concerned the Boers were well known to be a temperate race and as prisoners of war they had no possible means of obtaining alcoholic drinks and every man re turning to camp after leave of absence was strictly searched Rice was at no time issued as partof the rations Arsenic was carefully tested for in the drinking water with a negative result and if any had been present in tinned foods the home troops would have suffered equally as the rations for soldiers and Boers were identical Malaria was ordinarily unknown in St Helena and although it was common in someparts of South Africavet careful questioning of each patient in no case elicited a history of this disease On the other hand the conditions existing among the Boers would lend great countenance to the theory of place infec tion resulting in the development of a toxin outside the body The Boers had been confined to one camp of 3000 men for over two years The greatest care was taken as regards drainsge latrines removal of night soil etc but even so the grouud could not possibly have escaped being fouled during this long time Again the large majority of those attacked were old men so to 70 men who in their own country had been accustomed to a free active life but who now as prisoners moped took no exercise ate and slept too much and stayed mostly day and night in small huts with every aperture closed They never washed their bodies and never changed their clothes Conr ditions such as these in conjunction with fouled ground would naturally bring about a state of affairs favourable to the production of a toxin The mosquito could be eliminated in this case for the camp was at an elevation of 2000 ft and a strong sea breeze was constantly blowing Dr Wheeler had never seen a mosquito there but vermin of other kinds were there in plenty The theory of place infection was also strongly borne out by the fact that on moving the invalids to a site hitherto unoccupied a most rapid and marvellous improvement took place The earlier cases had been sent to Jamestown Station Hospital at sea level and a fair number of these died  but 41ter the establishment of the isolation camp at Dead Wood Plain there was not a single death every man recovered cjinpletely some in a weekor so others more slowly The treatment consisted solely in this change of location and in giving extra diet 1 tin of milk 2 oz of oatmeal and 3 oz of whisky to each man As regards the ordinary diet it was at no time deficient  and was identical with that of the home troops encamped on the same groundnamely fresh meat four days a week tinned meat two days vegetables and potatoes on alternate daysbread sugar and coffee It is true the vegetables were compressed and the potatoes were often not too good With regard to the water supply  on careful analysis this  was found to be rather suspicious  both free and albuminoid  ammonia were too high and there was too much chlorides  it was however passable However after the outbreak of beri  beri among the Boers and of enteric among our troops only distilled water was supplied  With regard to the clinical symptoms  every case with two exceptions was of the dropsical variety and in many cases there was rapid oedema of the scrotum and penis The scrotum often swelled so enormously as to require punctures There was no retention no albuminuria no marked anaemia no marked paralysis except in two cases mentioned above  but always numbness and often complete anaesthesia of the legs great pain over the tibiae and the sternum and in the worst cases dyspnoea Appetite was good and the bowel functions normal The spleen was not enlarged In about 30 per cent of the cases the gums were spongy and the calves of the legs hard The two exceptional cases showed marked ataxic symptoms rapid emaciation and a lemon tint of the skin like that of pernicious anaemia But these also recovered entirely The following points were of most importance as bearing on the question of place infection 1 Nearly all the patients were old men 50 to 70 worn out by hardships and mental anxiety  2 the proverbial dislike of ordinary Boer to clean liness and ventilation 3 the prolonged residence on the same camping ground though the sanitation and food and water supply were carefully looked after  4 the total absence of any similar disease among the home troops encamped on adjacent land equally crowded sleeping on bare ground but accustomed to bathing parades and by nature cleanly  5 the epidemic of enteric among the troops at the same time as the outbreak of beriberi occurred among the Boers  6 the marked recovery of even the most acute cases after their re moval to fresh ground and the addition to the ordinary diet as compared with the considerable mortality among those at first sent to Jamestown   Colonel Williamson PMO Capetown laid considerable stress on the fact that 26 out of 78 cases then in the beriberi camp had come from the Potchefstrom district of the Trans vaal where a mild form of beriberi was supposed to be endemic But it is hardly likely that a man could carry a latent disease for three years In regard to Dr Mansons observations on the relation between beriberi sleeping sickness and malaria Dr Wheeler writes After having been in constant attendance on the beriberi camp for two months I went down to Jamestown one day when I was not feeling very well having had sub acute malaria for a few days In Jamestown I remarked to another medical man that I had a severe pain in the calf of my right leg and jokingly said I believe I have got beri beri myself I did not feel inclined for lunch and walked back to camp a distance of six miles up an ascent of 2000 ft When I arrived home I collapsed completely went straight to bed and did not waken for twentyfour hours  then I slept again for three whole days without food or drink On the fourth day I wakened in hospital perfectly well except for slight numbness in the right arm and leg and pain in the wrists Drugs or alcoholism could be entirely excludedj I have always been strictly temperate and the causation puzzled everyone For myself I put it down to sheer exhaus tion but the paper referred to has suggested a possible con nection with beriberi I was never unconscious  only always wanted to sleep Three days of constant feeding made me absolutely well again in fact in better form than I had been for a long time  During a residence of six years in tea districts in India I have naturally seen a large number of cases of the disease known there as beriberi and of malaria in all its forms I have also as a visitor seen the form of beriberi common in Singapore but this epidemic in St Helena has exhibited features very different from those in the other countries The icutenees of the cases the rapid recovery on removal to fresh ground the absence of all factors hitherto considered causa uve with the notable exception of that of fouled ground and personal uncleanliness is most remarkable  SouthWest London Medical SocietyTne first meeting f the winter session of this Society was held on October 8th it Bolingbroke Hospital Wndsworth Common

collecting evidence on the subject of typhoid fever and the variations in the condition of the water supply but as yet it is too soon to publish the results I have obtained AIRBORNE TYPHOID By LieutenantColonel R H QUILL RAMC Senior Medical Officer Ceylon At the late meeting of our Association Dr Leigh Canney read a very interesting paper on the Etiology of Typhoid Fever in which while strenuously supporting the proposition that epidemics of typhoid fever are always waterborne he vigorously denounced those who ventured to believe that such epidemics could sometimes be traced to an airborne origin I should like to say at the outset of the remarks I have to offer on Dr Canneys proposition that I in common as I be lieve with the officers of the RAMC as a body hold that epidemics of typhoid fever are chiefly waterborne and it is to the water supply we first turn our attention when investigat ing the origin of typhoid cases occurring sporadically or epidemically But I am entirely at issue with Dr Canney when he lays down the hard and fast proposition that typhoid epidemics are invariably waterbornenever airborne The subject is one of farreaching importance well deserv ing of full discussion I will therefore as briefly as possible adduce evidence to prove that the waterborne theory will not always account for the occurrence of a typhoid epidemic My facts will be drawn from our experience in connexion with the large camp in this island where Boer prisoners of war are confined In August 1900 a large camp was formed at Diyatalawa in the hills of Ceylon for the Boer prisoners of war The first batch of prisoners arrived on August 9th and succeeding batches quickly followed until by the end of December 96 officers and some 5000 men were under confinement On September 21st 1900 one of the prisoners who had arrived on September 5th reported sick He was found to be suffering from typhoid fever of probably ten or more days duration  This was the commencement of an epidemic of typhoid among the prisoners which soon assumed formidable proportions By the end of December 600 cases had been diagnosed as typhoid fever And during the same period some 200 cases of simple continued fever occurred many of which it is highly probable were mild cases of typhoid We fully satisfied ourselves that this epidemic of typhoid among the prisoners had been imported from South Africa but in that connexion I refrain from further remarks as it has nothing to do with the proposition I have set myself to prove It is here necessary for my argument that I should briefly describe the relationship which exists between the prisoners camp and that of the surrounding camp where is located the military guard The prisoners camp situated on an undulating slope is surrounded with a strong fence of barbed wire  outside that fence are inner and outer military guard lines The  inner guard consists of a number of sentry boxes at intervals of 100 yards and placed only some 20 yards from the barbed wire fence The  outer guard  consists of guard huts occupied by strong guards placed on rising ground some 200 yards further back The latrines urinals washhouses and hospitals for the prisoners are all situated close to the barbed wire fence which surrounds the prisoners camp as a whole The guard for the prisoners was formed by the 2nd Battalion Kings Royal Rifles who were a fine healthy body of men No suspicious fever of any kind prior tothe outbreak among the prisoners existed among them The battalion remained in a thoroughly satisfactory healthy condition until October 18th 1000that is for over two months after its arrival at Diyatalawa and for a month after the first case of typhoid occurred among the prisoners  On October 18th a man reported sick he was found to be suffering from fever which quickly proved to be typhoid From that date admissions for typhoid among the battalion occurred at short intervals until by the end of December there had been altogether 24 admissions and 5 deaths Now in attempting to account for this outbreak of typhoid fever among the military guard at Diyatalawa Camp I com mence by advancing the following evidence against the out break having been in any sense waterborne 1 The water supply was obtained from a mountain stream some three miles distant and was brought into camp by underground iron pipes The intake in the hills was so isolated that its pollution was indeed very remote On the arrival in camp of the main iron pipes smaller ones passed directly into four large Pasteur tank filters disposed about the camp n suitable positions while in each barrack hut portable Pasteur or Berkefeld filters were placed and kept under careful supervision  thus all water used in the camp before its distribution invariably passed through a thoroughly reliable filtering medium The water prior to filtration was subjected to a weekly chemical analysis and the report always gave the water a high character a similar verdict followed frequent bacteriological examinations There has been no alteration in the water supply or filtering arrange ments since the camp was opened and no case of typhoid fever has occurred among the troops since December 1900 that is since the practical cessation of the epidemic among the prisoners of war 2 No fresh milk was allowed within the camp precincts When milk was required condensed milk Milkmaid Brand wars used 3 All aerated waters used in camp came from the Ceylon Brewery at Newera Eliza and were identical with those used at that sanatorium There has been no enteric fever at Newera Eliza 4 No uncooked food or uncooked vegetables were used in camp 5 No native hawkers of any kind were allowed to enter the camp 6 Within the camp there were five or six native shops  these were under strict military supervision No native drinks of any kind were sold in them The aerated water sold in them were invariably procured from the Ceylon Brewery at Newera Eliza 7 All men leaving the camp for purposes of duty or pleasure were obliged to take with them a water bottle filled with filtered water 8 It is to be remembered that for obvious military reasons the camp was situated in an isolated position in the hills far removed from habitations of any kind As the foregoing considerations in my judgment com pletely put out of court a waterborne cause as being respon sible for the typhoid outbreak in the military camp I was driven to the conclusion that the infection was airborne being derived from the adjoining prisonersofwar camp where at the time an epidemic of typhoid fever wa raging In support of that opinion I submit the following obser vations  1 Guard huts accommodating strong guards surround the prisoners lines and are close to them This for military reasons is unavoidable 2 The men on sentry iuty are during day and night posted at short intervals almost immediately outside the barbed wire enclosure which separates the prisoners from the mili tary camp Thus those on sentry duty a numerous body of men are in close contact not only with the prisoners but with their latrines urinals and washhouses all of whichs I have already stated are situated close to the barbed wire fence The undesirability on health grounds of the line of sentries being placed so close to the prisoners camp was fully recognised but for military reasons it was not found possible to alter the arrangement  From the foregoing remarks it will be obvious that those on duty in the guard huts and sentry boxes must be to a very appreciable extent exposed to the emanations arising from the latrines used by the prisoners of war especially during the time when the latrines are emptied a frequent necessity Now assuming that such manation contained typhoid organismsnot a very farfetched hypo 34 mSSLSSJPRETORIA FEVERFeb 15 1902 thesis when we remember that at the time typhoid fever was very rife in the prisoners camp and further assuming that typhoid infection can be airbornethe possibility nay the probability of the infection being thus conveyed from ttie prisoners camp to the military guards appears to be well founded 3 But in addition to the assumption that the emanations from the prisoners latrines may have conveyed infection to the military guard it has to be recorded that the soil of the prisoners camp gave peculiar facilities for the spread of the infection The rank grass which originally covered the slope upon which the previous camp was arranged very soon dis appeared giving place to a reddish soil so friable that dust was much in evidence notwithstanding that it was the rainy season of the year Now it is not unreasonable to reject as pure the dust of a camp in which at the time a formidable epidemic of typhoid fever was prevailing 4 Lastly the possibility of the infection being conveyed to some extent by flies must be considered During the whole period that typhoid fever was prevailing in the prisoners camp flies in that camp amounted almost to a plague the military camp being also infested but to a lesser extent Now flies being well adapted for the carriage of infection it is plain that under the conditions existing in the prisoners amp there would be nothing to prevent flies laden with typhoid bacilli migrating from the prisoners to the military camp and thereby conveying to the latter camp the poison they carried I have endeavoured in this paper to review dispassionately the evidence bearing on the causation of the typhoid outbreak which occurred among the military guard at Diyatalawa Camp Ceylon during the closing months of 1900 I submit that I have shown  That all water avenues through which typhoid fever could have been conveyed to the military Chjnp at Diyatalawa were efficiently guarded and therefore tnat a waterborne origin must be abandoned b That the infection was airborne resulting from emana tions from specifically infected latrines

and Assistant Medical Officer Fever Hospital Metropolitan Asylums Board London A great many soldiers who stay for any length of time in Pretoria or its neighbourhood suffer from attacks of fever of a remittent type which is of short duration and for want of a better name and a good deal from want of any accurate know ledge of its nature is returned either as  remittent  malarial remittent sometimes simple continued fever and has even been given the special name  Pretoria fever To ally the complaint with malaria however is distinctly wrong as it has no connexion whatever with it Below I only refer to the fever of the Pretoria neighbour hood I do not include the simple continued fever so common at the beginning of the war amongst soldiers especially in Cape Colony This fever was more often of an intermittent type True malaria does not so far as I can ascertain exist in Pretoria and its neighbourhood among the soldiers except cases imported from Komati Poort and its surround ing districts I am informed however that amongst the poorer class of Dutch living on the lowlying ground near the river in Pretoria a low form of fever occurs but I have seen no cases of a malarial nature amongst soldiers living near I am also informed that about Penaars River an intermittent fever occurs among the soldiers  the temperature rarely rises over ioo and is unaffected by quinine Personally I have neither heard of nor seen a single case of remittent fever originating in this district in which plasmodia have been found in the blood Captain Beveridge RAMC Analyst to the Army in South Africa who has examined the blood of many of these cases has not met with a single instance The onset of fever is as a rule sudden  the patient has been feeling out of sorts probably for a day or two previously but not sufficiently so as to cease work The attack com menees with acute frontal headache pains in the back and legs  sometimes acute pain in the lower part of the occipital region which occasionally occurs in enteric fever and is rather a characteristic symptom when present  sensations of  cold water being poured down the back  often vomiting  loss of appetite and malaise In 24 hours the temperature may reach 1040 rarely higher A history of diarrhoea previous to admission to hospital is often given When admitted generally after about twentyfour hours fever the patients condition is usually as follows Head ache as above also about this time slight abdominal pain located as a rule by the patient above the umbilicus and passing from right to left slightly griping in nature an almost constant symptom Vomiting if present rarely lasts more than twentyfour hours after admission Diarrhoea is fairly common for the first day sometimes longer but occasionally the patient is constipated He is heavy and languid with flushed face The temperature variable between ioo and 1040 as a rule The tongue is generally thickly coated with white or yellow fur sometimes inclined to be dry sometimes quite moist  occasionally quite clean even rawlooking and moist No enlargement of the spleen can be felt but as a rule there is tenderness over this region below the costal margin and sometimes over the liver On the whole the condition on admission is generally much more characteristic of an intestinal lesion than of malaria The temperature generally descends gradually dropping one or two degrees in the morning rising half to one and ahalf in the night The time of descent is variable two days or much longer but remittent in character The symptoms rapidly ameliorate  the headache disappears within two or three days and even though the patient has a temperature of 1010 or 1020 at night he may be quite indignant at being kept in bed and on a light diet Spots resembling enteric only occurred in one case of mine at the sixth day but not more that 20 per cent of the enterics out here have characteristic spots The stools are rarely typically enteric The pulse is slow and quite out of proportion to the temperature In one or two cases it was markedly dicrotic even when the tempera

WOUNDS IN WAR By CharlesRoberts MB BS FRCS Resident Surgicar Officer Manchester RoyalCnrmary late Civil Surgeon So nth African FielaForce In discussing the treatment of abdominal wounds in war we have to consider i the nature of the injury 2 the cases in which operative interference is indicated and 3 to what extent the prospectof success of abdominal operations is diminished by the difficulties inseparable from campaigning When the wound is caused by a highvelocity and mantled bullet of small calibreas the Mauser and LeeMetfordthe extent of the visceral injury depends little if at all upon the range at which the bullet is fired except in some instances in which the wound is complicated by injury to bone At very long ranges when the force is spent and in ricochet wounds the bullet may be retained The course it takes within the abdomen is then lost and the internal injuries maybe widespread and with difficulty made out Where both wounds of entry and exit are present the track is always that of a straight line drawn between these two points and from anatomical knowledge we are able to say what viscera may have been injured Transverse wounds are more fatal than those passing in an anteroposterior direc tion Wounds above the umbilicus are more favourable than those below Direct anteroposterior wounds in the small in testine area are very unfavourable Complete transverse wounds above the umbilicus are very unfavourable That the small intestine area may be crossed without perforation occurring has been demonstrated  1 By examination after death In the published record of the work of the Portland Hospital in South Africa written by the professional staff a case is described the details of which were supplied by Mr Cheatle Two perforations were found in the caecum and sigmoid flexure of the colon and though the bullet had undoubtedly crossed the area occupied by the small intestine no wound of the bowel had occurred 2 By examination during lap aro to my Mr Makins in his work on his Surgical Experiences in South Africa gives an account of an operation in which two linear rents were found in the jejunum involving the peritoneal and muscular coats only He also noted in other instances linear ecchymoses and wounds of the peritoneal and muscular coats alone associ ated with complete perforations The view that the intestine escapes perforation in many of the cases that recover is sup ported by the fact that frequently so few abdominal symptoms arepresert It is difficult to believe however that in all cases no per foration is present for in many shock is severe frequent vomiting persists for two or three days the temperature rises and the abdomen becomes rigid and painful these symptoms being readily attributable to the shock of perforation and slight local peritoneal infection the necropsy in Mr Cheatles case previously mentioned showed that no extravasation of faeces had occurred from a perforation of the caecum and in cases operated upon no free escape of faeces has been found before manipulation Sometimes thepresence of melaena has formed strong evidence of perforation There is little doubt that a perforation may heal primarily or become shut off by  adhesion to a neighbouring coil within a few hours In considering the cases in which operative interference is required we must first exclude those wounded who will die in the first twentyfour hours from intraperitoneal haemorrhage or from the shock of the extensive internal injuries and who are not amenable to surgical treatment Their number is always considerable probably from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of those wounded Where increasing peritoneal haemorrhage is threatening life and the surroundings and general condi tion of the patient allow of it laparotomy must always be performed and the bleeding arrested whether from torn vessels in the omentum or mesentery or from laceration of the liver or spleen Only too often however extensive visceral injuries will also be found and a favourable result will not be obtained Wounds of the liver kidney and spleen as a rule heal well and when haemorrhage is not dangerous require no operative treatment except for secondary complications such as biliary fistula nydro nephrosis or perinephric abscess Laparotomy may be required when perforation of the stomach or bowel may have taken place If we exclude those who die in the first twentyfour hours we may estimate that of the cases of penetrating abdominal wounds amenable to surgical treatment about 60 per cent will recover The recoveries however are chiefly amongst those cases in which the area of the small intestine is not crossed and when this area is involved the mortality is pro bably very great Too often without exploration we cannot be sure whether perforation exists or not and whilst a routine laparotomy is not justifiable in every case it should be per  formed at the first evidence that perforation exists Such evidence may be found in the persistence of shock a steady increase in the rate of the pulse and in the abdomen becom ing increasingly rigid and tender and especially is it probable if vomiting has persisted and the passage of flatus is arrested Under these circumstances and when the surroundings are such as not to expose the patient to fresh dangers the opera tions should not be delayed andthe apertures may be dealt with by suturing or the area of the wound may be resected according to the condition found Especially is the operation likely to be successful whn the injury is localized the patient is seen within six hours of being wounded and transport has not been difgcult When the bullet is retained or tne track is a complete transverse one the prognosis is far less favour able K The results of laparotomy for gunshot wounds in war have been most unfavourable In the SpanishAmerican war Senn reported that all cases he knew of that were operated on died In the Tirah campaign of 8 cases of penetrating wounds of the abdomen 5 were operated on and all died In the Boer war I only knew of 2 successful operations performed for wounds of the small intestine In the American war in the Philippines Dr Robinson reported that 5 cases were operated on and 4 died The unfavourable results are attributable to various causes The severity of the injuries the delay in bringing in the wounded difficult transport and the unfavour able surroundings render abdominal operations at the front in mosteases unpermissible We are led to the following con clusions 1 That as a rule the conditions in a field hospital are not suitable for performing laparotomy Moreovermany patients with penetrating abdominal wounds recover without opera tion and in the majority of those who die the nature of the injury is such that death must result whatever be the condi tions of operation and an exploratory laparotomy may add a fresh danger to the patient 2 Wh n occasions arise in which the conditions of operation 5 1Q28 m5LbSBJTHE REDCROSS BADGEfpcT 4 1902 approximate to those in civil practice laparotomy should be undertaken for increasing intraperitpneal haemorrhage en dangering life and when there is evidence that perforation of the stomach or bowel probably exists provided that the patient is seen early enough Dr Forbes Ross said that he had listened with great pleasure to Dr Robertss paper which went to prove that the smallbore bullet was the most humane implement yet invented for war The axiom in abdominal smallbore bullet wounds do not operate had now become a military medical actuality In fact the surgeon in these cases was more deadly than the enemy armed with the smallbore bullet Mr Clinton Dent at Ipswich and Sir Frederick Trves had foreshadowed this result which was now fairly accurately settled A FEW OBSERVATIONS MAINLY  CONCERNING THE REDCROSS BADGE By Deputy InspectorGeneral Porter CB RN In the late war in South Africa regrettable recriminations took place on both sides regarding alleged abuses of the Geneva Cross These appear to have in a great measure originated in misunderstanding due to preventable causes as well as in the changed conditions of modern warfare Smoke less powder the increased range of weapons and the possi bility of using artillery with precision against unseen adver saries have all combined to widen the modern battlefield In this way not only the combatants but the necessary adjuncts of armies medical and other are brought under fire At Magersfontein and at Paardeberg to quote from personal experience our field hospitals marked by Red Cros flags and pitched on sites selected with a view to nphexposure were shelled by the enemy In the former case even had the enemy distinguished the flags he could not be charged with deliberately firing upon them as he was shooting at extreme ranges of several thousand yards and could not possibly locate his objective within a hundred yards less or more In the latter case the formation of the ground precluded him from seeing his objectivea ridge intervened Consequently in these days when an engagement is pro ceeding the Cross is of value rather as a means of showing where aid can be obtained than as affording any specific pro tection to the wounded Of course when the fight is over the matter is different and the wearers of the Cross have their definite protective rights and limits in their own sphere of action These are fairly well understood by all men although very few even amongst medical officers have ever read the official conditions laid down by the Geneva Con ventions After making all possible allowances cases of deliberate abuse of the Cross occurred during the late war Perhaps the wonder is they were not more numerous when one remembers the lax discipline and the character of many of the mercenaries in the enemys ranks Besides the badge being of no particular size or material any one could fashion it and wear or hide it away at will  for example it enabled recruits for the Boers to cross the Portuguese frontier at Komati Poort Again the enemy when hard pressed by us as at Jacobsdal hid their Mausers donned Red Cross badges and so evading capture were able once more to fight against us What appears to be wanted is a uniform badge of strictly regulation pattern and materials  simple and at the same time not capable of being easily counterfeited This should be issued under proper authority to accredited wearers who should at the same time be supplied with regitered identification cards to be invariably carried on the person This card might also have printed on it the few more important laws regulating the Cross and the penalties of disobedience In like manner all Red Cross equipment such as ambulances cases of medical and surgical appliances comforts and so forth should be marked by authority and limited to their proper use In South Africa the enemy had all manner of vehicles adorned with red crosses A curious assortment fell into our hands after the fight at Modder and were magnanimously restored to Cronj although it was generally asserted they had been used for many purposes legitimate or otherwise accordingto the urgent needs of the moment So long as there is no punishment for painting a red cross on a case here and there even amongst friends the temptation to wrongdoing is great for example when the forced march is imminent and personal baggage is reduced almost to the vanishing point In the early days of our occupation of Bloemfontein certain ladies in virtue of wearing red cross badges they had fashioned for themselves managed to get up by train all theway from Cape Town at a time when the necessities of the military situation were extreme and the meagre railway transport was being taxed to its utmost These ladies were not nurses but all that befell them was to be returned whence they came Probably to this day they think they did a smart thing and are in no way conscious of being guilty of a discreditable action In the next naval war the care of the wounded will fall mainly upon hospital ships and their ambulance steam launches serving under the flag of the Geneva Convention Your modern ship of war is first and foremost a fighting machine and so while the best possible provision that the limited circumstances will admit of is made for the wounded yet military necessity must remain paramount and extensive space cannot be spared for hospital purposes In the brutal business of war methods which often appear harsh in the outset turn out to be really the most humane in the end During an action there must be suffering  probably little more can be done for the wounded than to promptly get them out of the way of the men fighting the guns relieve their pain 8to bleeding and generally put them in the most favourable position for removal to the hospital ship after the engagement is over Special ambulance boats will then steam alongside and the wounded be promptly hoisted into them by such eminently suitable contrivances as the Kirker ambulance sleigh Here I would call attention to an obvious defect in the Red Cross flag  When flying in the bows of a hospital boat and at only a short distance off it closely resembles the St Georges Cross that is the official badge of a British Admiral It is quite conceivable in war time that the one might be mistaken for the other and disastrous results ensue say to a boat loaded with wounded The badge of the Geneva Convention afloat should be clearly outside the pale of pos sible confusion with any combatant device whatsoever and least of all an admirals flag The Geneva Convention has laid down certain regulations regarding hospital ships fitted out by private enterprise for the aid of belligerents irrespective of side  but it is I believe silent regarding the rights of Government hospital ships Are they liable to be made prizes of war If so will they first be permitted to convey their sick and wounded to their destination It would be well if some authoritative ruling could be arrived at as to what extent benevolent neutrality may go in the supply of aid to either belligerent Our Continental neighbours recently decried us for being so cruel as to refuse them permission to send ambulances through our lines to the enemy This at the time was specious  but we now know in the light of afterevents the gift of ambulances would have been the reverse of humane and would have served to pro long a useless struggle with the  certain consequence of increased bloodshed To sum up finally regarding the badge  i While easily recognizable it should not be easily counter feited or be capable of confusion with any combatant device in use afloat or ashore 2 It should be issued under authority only When issued to individuals they also should be provided with means of proving their identity to friend or foe 3 Abuses of the badge should entail definite penalties and as a rule these should be swift and severe In the last number of the Official Blue Bookthe Health of the Navy for 1900I dwelt at some length on the subject now discussed As however Blue Books are to most men sealed books and the matter is of importance I have therefore taken the liberty of bringing it before you and trust I have suc ceeded in

part of the pyrexial period the patient lost flesh and became anaemic Convalescence was slow and he did not recover his usual health before the end of July TreatmentHe was treated wtth quinine salol and tonics without ap preciable result Examination of the BloodHis blood was examined by me on two occa sions once about the middle and once towards the end of the pyrexial stage Malaria parasites were not found and the blood did not aggluti nate the typhoid bacillus in dilution of i to 20 In the early part of December four months after complete recovery Dr Dodgson examined the blood and found that it agglutinated the Malta fever coccus in dilu tion of 1 to 40 Case 11A civil medical officer aged 28 was admitted into the Yeomanry Hospital at Pretoria on October 5th HistoryHe arrived at Capetown in July was at Deelfontein for a few weeks and had since been in Pretoria He had not been abroad before He had never had enteric fever and had not been inoculated He suffered from diarrhoea shortly after arriving in South Africa and the motions have been liquid or pultaceous ever since Early SymptomsFor a week before admission he was laid up with malaise and pyrexia the temperature rising to 1010 or 102o in the evening and falling to normal in the morning On admission October 5th there were no physical signs but he complained of pain in the back of the neck which lasted for a few days and then disappeared On October 18th the spleen could be felt just below the costal margin and the tongue was slightly dry and brown On October 24th the spleen was a trifle larger  the tongue was now moist but still brown Examination of BloodOn October 27th the blood was examined by Dr Dodgson  it agglutinated the Malta fever coccus in dilution of 1 to 80 but gave no reaction with the typhoid bacillus ProgressUp to this period the patient had not felt ill and with the exception of slight enlargement of the spleen there was no physical sign The temperature had run an irregular course being normal during part of each day but always being raised to 1010 or 102o some time or other in the day On the morning of October 28th the temperature was normal but from that time it gradually rose and reached 104o on the evening of October 31st From October 29th until November 9th there was con tinuous pyrexia the temperature varying between ioo and 103o On November 10th the temperature was normal and continued so with the exception of a rise to 103o on November nth and slighter rises on No vember 13th 14th and 17th During the period between October 28th and November 10th the patient felt ill and became emaciated and his con dition gave rise to anxiety There was no definite physical sign with the exception of gradual enlargement of the spleen This organ on November  1 th could be felt nearly 3 inches below the costal margin and was de cidedly hard Second Examination of the BloodThe blood was examined by Dr Dodgson on November nth when it agglutinated the Malta fever coccus in dilution of 1 to 60 but gave no reaction with the typhoid bacillus Recovery After November nth the spleen rapidly diminished in size and in a few days no enlargement could be made out The patient gradually improved and he was discharged on December nth from the hospital whence he proceeded to Capetown After a few weeks he had ite returned to his normal state of health During the illness the abdomen was never distended and there were no typical enteric spots The motions were sometimes liquid and sometimes pultaceous and were ever typical of enteric fever TreatmentHe was treated with quinine sodium salicylate salol arsenic potassium iodide and other drugs without appreciable effect I feel sure from clinical observation that neither of these patients was the subject of enteric fever and this is sup ported by the negative result with the agglutination test In both cases towards the end of the pyrexial period the question of general tuberculosis was raised and in Case i the hard enlarged spleen was in favour of such a diagnosis The complete recovery which ensued put general tuberculo sis however out of court I think that these cases resemble Malta fever more closely than any other disease The only absolutely certain means of determining Malta fever is to obtain the cocci from the spleen but in lieu of this we have the positive test of the agglutination of the cocci by the blood I do not know how far this test is reliable and consequently I do not know how imuch value to place upon it Nearly a year ago when I was in Kimberley I heard of cases which I considered to be most probably Malta fever so that it is not unlikely that this disease occurs in South Africa Two other cases which I have seen out here resembled Case 11 in many respects In neither case did the blood agglutinate the typhoid bacillus and in one case it failed to agglutinate the Malta fever coccus but in the other case this test was not applied Pretoria March 12th 1901 PresentationA handsome writing table was recently pre sented on the occasion of his marriage to Dr Charles

THOMAS FRCSEng Senior Surgeon to the late Welsh Military Hospital Honorary Surgeon to the Hamadryad Hospital to the Cardiff Infirmary etc I have already recorded my views1 regarding the

pegs which form the angles or corners of a rectangular parallelogram the sides of which are 50 feet by 33 feet that is the regulation distances of the weatherline pegs The next step is to find the point of intersection of the diagonals by means of two pieces of string and place the centre of the ridge pole upon it The strings are then April 20 1901 THE WELSH HOSPITAL IN SOUTH AFRICA mSSLi

blank in the centre of sides for the doorway The ground plan is now ready and the further procedure about the raising of the marquee is carried out in the usual manner Fig 2From Manual Royal Army Medical Corps 1899 Ground plan of the pegs of the maiquee showing direction of weather lines  weather line pegs  x bracing line pegs The regulation method is difficult to carry out quickly as there are many complex measurements to be attended to and the weatherline pegs are the last to be driven in whilst they are the first to be driven in in Keoghs method and they seem to me to be the key to the whole plan of the hos pital The width of the avenues of locomotion from front to  rear and from flank to flank is determined upon by fixing j the weather line pegs There is very little trouble in grasp I ing the principle of placing any number of parallelograms of i definite sizes in straight lines at definite intervals whilst the chances of going wrong are reduced to a minimum The advantages of Keoghs plan over the present regula tion method may be summed up under the following headings  i It is simple to understand 2 The camp is more easily kept clean on account of having a single row of pegs which admit a brush between them i 3 The camp looks smarter And lastly but not the least in importance there is more room inside the marquee because the rounded corners of the marquee are raised higher on account of the longer pull of the bracing lines and the difficulty of arranging six or eight oblong beds conveniently into a more or less oval marquee Clinton Dent is to a certain extent overcome by Keogh method My own bias is for the regulation marquee Types of Bullets and Wounds Produced by Them Fig 3 shows the different types of bullets I came acrossr and with most of them I feel sure you are already ac quainted It is hardly necessary to reiterate the fact that wounds in flicted by ricochet bullets are severe or that the lesions of an expanding bullet are most disastrous after penetrating bone while those of the LeeMetford and Mauser are of a com paratively trivial character I cannot refrain from relating the case of a Colonial trooper who was shot through the right posterior triangle of the neck the bullet entering an inch and ahalf above the centre of the clavicle and emerging through the centre at the middle of the sternum the only symptom being a transitory feeling of uselessness of the right upper ex tremity with a sensation of a  hot flush  running down the 1 imb Recovery was complete and rapid without any paresi s I am inclined to attribute the sensations of the patient to being caused by the hydrodynamical displacement of the fluid of the tissues in front and around the bullet upon the brachial plexus during its transit whilst the relative harmless ness of the bullet to important structures may be explained to a certain degree by the fluid wave immediately in front of the bullet partly separating or bluntly dissecting or pushing aside the movable structures such as veins arteries and nerves Boys many years ago photographed the airwave which precede and accompany bullets travelling through air and one cannot but infer ev analoga the existence of a fluidwave preceding the bullet travelling through the body  such a  fluidwave acting as a blunt

haemorrhage As I have had a few questions addressed to me by private correspondents I think a few diagrams would assist in rendering more clearly the method of using the tourniquetthan a long description Messrs Mayer and Meltzer have made for me the forcepstourniquet repre sented in Fig 5 and this is the only size I now use for amputations on the young and the old I had smaller sizes made at first but further experience showed that they are quite unneces sary and are not suitable for patients with big or stout limbs whilst the larger size will do for almost every amputation upon thin or corpulent patients The causes for removing limbs in military and in civil practice are not often iden tical but the methods of amputating are the same and vary with the bias of the operator concerned As I have had a larger experience of amputations in civil than in military practice I  trust that the recording of the two fol I lowing cases will be instructive with II

principles should be ap plied in towns but here of course the steps to be taken must be governed by local conditions and the reports are largely concerned with recommendations on this head as to particular places Daniels points out that it must always be remem bered that in a European convalescent from an attack of fever his parasites will be in the stage capable of being transmitted to the mosquito He must therefore be well guarded against the attacks of mosquitos both for his own and his neighbours sake and with such an inmate thorough fumigation of the house should always be practised Stephens and Christophers state further that in Europeans parasites are rarely found except in definite attacks of fever and that even in the case of those who habitually sleep without mosquito nets and exposed to the risks of constant infection the parasites were very seldom found so that at any one time only a very small percentage of Europeans showed the least trace of malarial infection whereas in native children in Lagos and on the Gold Coast the frequency with which gametes occurred was very striking They insist that it should be clearly realised by Europeans in the towns that they are dwelling in the midst of thousands of cases of malaria none the less dangerous to them though in the native child presenting none of the characteristic signs of an attack of fever They thus sum up their main conclusion which is that malarial fever is a contagious disease contracted through the medium of the mosquito from the native child Need for a Sanitary Service Daniels writing of British Central Africa and British East Africa makes the following observations with which we may conclude this notice of the reports  Sufficient attention is not paid to sanitation in its widest sense Sani tary works are usually performed either by local Boards or a general Board of works with or without medical advice They are not directly under the control of a medical department Money set apart to the medical departments is entirely absorbed in treating disease that is for hospitals nurses etc and little or none spent in preventive medicine Most of the money for public works is spent on public buildings and im provements which may be indirectly beneficial to the public health or not Money devoted to preventive medicine or sanitation should be kept apart from either the medical or public works votes and accounted for separately A separate department for sanitary affairs distinct either from public works or the medical department would I think be advan tageous in most places ANOPHELES AND AGUE IN ENGLAND Grassi has stated that the geographical distribution of the genus Anopheles in Italy coincides with that of malaria and has used this generalisation to exclude on the ground of their wider geographical distribution a number of blood sucking insects as possible carriers of the parasite of malaria Celli1 snowed that the statement that the distribution of Anopheles corresponded with that of malaria is not true even for Italy as he found it in various Alpine valleys in situa tions where there has never been any malaria In the first number of the Journal of Hygiene there is a paper by Drs George H F Nuttall and Louis Cobbett and Mr StrangewaysPigg giving an account of a detailed in vestigation which they have made with regard to the distri bution of Anopheles in England Three species of Anopheles are known to occur in England  these are A maculipennis A claviger Fabr vel maculipennis A bifurcatus and A nigripes Of these the firstnamed is by far the most common At the present day Anopheles in Great Britain are most numerous m lowlying land containing many ditches ponds and slowflowing water suitable for the habitat of the larvae and corresponding to the districts where ague was formerly prevalent Further they found not only that Anopheles is present in parts of England where malaria used to exist but also in other parts where there is no history or tradition of malaria ever having existed It therefore appears that the disappearance of ague from Great Britain does not depend upon the extinction of mosquitos capable of harbouring the parasite and the authors suggest that the disappearance of the disease is probably due to several causes operating together  a A reduction in the number of these insects consequent upon drain age of the land this being in accord wdth all the older authors who attributed the disappearance of ague largely to this cause b Reduction of the population in infected districts as the result of emigration about the time when ague disappeared from England this would naturally reduce the number of infected individuals and thus lessen the chance of the Anopheles becoming infected c It is possible that the use of quinine has reduced the chances of in fecting the Anopheles through checking the development of the parasites in the blood of subjects affected with ague They express the opinion that the firstmentioned cause seems to have been chiefly operative and that the existence of Anopheles in nonmalarious districts may explain the occa sional occurrence of ague in outoftheway places for with suitable conditions of temperature and the requisite number of Anopheles a malarious patient coming from other parts might infect the local insects which in turn would spread the infection to healthy persons It would appear therefore that the actual number of Anopheles in a district may have a considerable influence on the prevalence of malaria   ibkitish Medical JLopjrnal October 13th 1900 p 1137  THE PREVENTION OF WATERBORNE TYPHOID IN ARMIES IN THE FIELD In a paper on this subject read before the Epidemiolgica Society on January i8th by Dr Louis Parkes and Samuel Rideal DSc FIC the outbreak of typhoid fever among our troops in South Africa was discussed The questions  arising in connection with the outbreak might said the authors be summarised as follows  i Has the number of cases of enteric fever proportional to troops employed exceeded that characterising other cam paigns in similar climates with similar disadvantageous sani tary surroundings  2 Was the likelihood of enteric fever becoming epidemic amongst the troops foreseen by the military authorities  3 Were the best practicable and available means taken to safeguard the army both in stationary camps and when on the march  It seemed highly probable that the first cases amongst the troops arose from the consumption of water infected with the enteric virus derived either from the civil population with whom the troops were brought into contact or more probably from the Boer combatants amongst whom it was generally supposed the disease was present from their first taking the field Inasmuch as troops on the march were always careful to choose camping grounds which had not been previously in use unless strategical reasons rendered such a course neces sary whereas they were often dependent for their water supply on sources which had been already defiled either by the enemy or by advance columns of their own side the as sumption appeared to be warranted that if it were possible to render all water used in drinking by the troops innocuous there would be no general development of enteric fever on a large scale The sterilisation of water for the use of troops either by boiling or filtration was impossible of attainment during the rapid marches and swift changes of position necessitated by war conducted on modern methods Even if filters or boiling apparatus could be made to accompany a rapidly moving column it was very doubtful if men parched by long marches performedunder a fiery sun and in clouds of dust could be restrained om slaking their thirst as soon as they arrived at water Failing the sterilisation of water by boiling or filtration it was asked Is there any substance which can be added to water which will destroy the virulence or inhibit the growth of the bacillus typhosus whilst not rendering the water unpalatable or injurious to the health of the consumer  Ordinary poisonsor even nonpoisonous disinfectants were inadmissible for this purpose There were other sub stances howeverwhich might be expected to prove beneficial as regards their effect upon bacillus typhosus whilst not harmful to the consumer Such were the dilute mineral acidsdilute sulphuric acid BP and dilute nitrohydro chloric acid PP and the organic acids citric and tartaric which were largely used in the manufacture of lemonade Other substances with which the authors had experimented were acid bisulphate of soda and acid phosphate of soda and sulphovinate of soda All these were bodies of which the human system was tolerant whilst in the proportions whicli Jan 26 1901 NOTES ON HEALTH RESORTSitlSSi 243 they had found to be required after contact of from fifteen to thirty miuutes to inhibit the growth and activity of bacillus typhosus they were quite palatable imparting a subacid flavouring which was agreeable to the taste and would materially aid in quenching thirst After reference to previous work on the subject by Stutzer Christmas Reinsch Schum berg and Braithwaite the authors gave details of experi ments which they had performed In the case of tartaric citric and nitrohydrochloric acids it did not appear that anything less than the maximum BP dose per pint of water was efficient to sterilise if the contact was not to last longer than fifteen minutes Half the maxi mum dose 10 grains per pint was inefficient in the case of citric and tartaric acids after 15 minutes contact whilst the minimum dose 5 grains per pint of citric acid had no effect after twentyfour hours contact  and in the case of tartaric acid the minimum dose did not completely sterilise after the same period Of the two tartaric acid appeared to be the more potent in its destructive action upon bacillus typhosus As regards the dilute acids nitrohydrochloric and sul phuric the former appeared to be more efficient than the latter  but no further experiments were made with them as it was considered essential that the substance tobe carried by individual soldiers in the field should be a solid which could be made up into small tabloids and not a liquid which would have to be carried in a bottle and be measured out with some exactitude when required for the purpose of steril ising the water to be used for drinking Acid sodium bisulphate was not a BP medicinal sub stance It probably had no purgative effect as the astringent properties of its free sulphuric acid would tend to counteract any laxative action of the sodium sulphate The minimum purgative dose of sodium sulphate was a quarter of an ounce and as the authors only suggested the use of 15J grains of the bisulphate to every pint of water a man would have to drink 7 pints of water before a quarter of an ounce of salt not known to be purgative would be taken Even if this quantity of water was drunk in a day there is no evidence that a quarter of an ounce of the bisulphate would exert any harmful effect There was evidence that the bacillus typhosus was killed by only five minutes contact with sodium bisulphate in the proportion of 1 gram 15I gr per pint of infected water  but in their opinion it was better that contact should be made for fifteen minutes in order that sterility might be ensured Ex perimental trials were also made with acid sodium phosphate and with sodium sulphovinate but these substances were found inefficient It might be used as an argument against the deductions which the authors thought they were entitled to draw from their experiments that in broth cultures of bacillus typhosus the organisms were living under artificial conditions and that waters infected by natural means de rived the living virus directly from the faeces or urine of an enteric fever patient There would be reason in such a line of argument if it could be shown that the bacilli on emerging from the human body were more resistant to adverse agencies such as their chemical solutions were than those which had been cultured and subcultured in broth That this was not generally held tobe sowas now recognised for the probabilities were in favour of the view that patho genic organisms by propagation in artificial media outside the human body tended to become saphrophytic  and whilst very probably losing in virulence yet acquired higher resistant powers to agencies affecting their life and growth than they ever possessed when they flourished as parasites in the human body The authors thought there was every probability that the agency which proved fatal to the subcultured bacilli would have an equal if not greater effect upon organisms of high virulence im mediately derived from the excreta of an enteric fever patient Experiments were made by them to determine the dose of the poison or the number of bacilli that must be imbibed in order to induce the disease a subject on which practically nothing certain was known Their conclusions were that on the whole it would appear as if one might be justified in assuming that  1  water naturally infected with the virus of the disease did not contain so very large a proportion of the bacillus  that 2 thiorganism wanot by any means resistant to acids  or other weak disinfectants  ahd 3 that the use of such simple means as suggested by the authors for combating infection had possibly a future before it more especially under conditions of life where the means of sterilisation by boiling and filtration were not readily available As regards the use of sodium bisulphate during a cam paign they recommended its being employed in the form of tabloids each tabloid to contain 5 grs of the bisulphate The tabloids should be made to dissolve quickly in water and for this purpose the minimum quantity of gum arabio or other adhesive substance should be used in their manu facture The tabloids should be put up in wellmade light metallic boxes to hold about  lb weightequivalent to about 350 tabloidsenough to sterilise over 100 pints of water at the rate of 3 per pint One of these boxes should be carried by every soldier in his haversack Supposing the soldier to consume 5 pints aday when on the march the J lb tin would suffice for nearly three weeks at the end of which time he will probably again be in touch with his transport Instructions should be given by the medical officer to the rank and file as to the use of the tabloids and more especially as to the desirability of allowing all contaminated water to remain in contact with the dissolved tabloids for at least fifteen minutes before being consumed The acid tabloids would be found to render the water much more effective in slaking thirst and there would in conse quence be less inclination to drink large quantities of water a smaller quantity when acidulated sufficing The tabloids  might also be used as thirst lozenges when water was scarce and would they believed be found useful by promoting tliB secretion of saliva and so preventing parching of the mouth The authors were informed by an officer recently returned from the war that he found the thirst lozenges he took put I with him from England most useful There was an immense de mand for them by the men of his company  and the men who took them were satisfied with much less water than those who failed to obtain any NOTES ON HEALTH RESORTS Climate of Teneriffe By Stanford Harris MD MRCS

SURGERY OLD AND NEW By Sir William MacCormac Bart KCB KCVO MA MCh LLD DSc On October ist 1856 Mr MWhinnie assistant surgeon to St Bartholomews Hospital delivered the introductory address at that Institution In the course of it he referred to the Crimean War and many of his remarks are applicable now He said that  although the military surgeon enjoys certain advantages which the events of the late war promise to render greater we must not conceal the fact that military surgeons have not yet attained the position to which their varied acquirements skill and devotion fairly entitles them Speaking of the return of the victorious regiments and the enthusiasm which accompanied their triumphal entry he called to mind the glorious part our own professional brethren had taken in the struggle and that the surgeons had as in preceding wars distinguished themselves oy their skill devotion bravery and humanity He quoted Colonel Ambert a French colonel of dragoons who had used in October 1854 generous and eloquent words in describing the qualities of the medical officer  In the hour after the battle he will be chief among the multitude during the fight calm when all around is agitated and disturbed in an atmosphere of grape shot and smoke he must deny himself all emotion The shrieks of the wounded the booming of cannon and the crash of shells do not disturb himall ranks appeal to him for help and he gives it alike to the poor soldier or to the mighty general to the fallen amongst the enemy and the wounded of his own army  After the battle the General and his soldiers hear the shouts of triumph but the surgeon has to listen to the groans of the sufferer  night comes on and all are asleep save him awake amongst the wounded and next day exhausted with fatigue he sets out again with his ambulance giving hope to all improvising a thousand methods and supplying material means of aid by the power of his intelligence and skill Honour then to him  his mission is a thousand times sacred Fellow citizens you who were so moved at the heart rending sufferings of your soldiers in the East the military surgeon has saved your sons though he may himself have died at his post and the heroism of science has equalled if it has not surpassed the bravery of the field of battle Mr MWhinnie pointed out that from evidence given before Parliamentary committees and other undeniable testimony it was clearly shown that the blame attached to the medical department at the beginning of the Crimean campaign was undeserved and had the hygienic measures suggested by its members been carried out the losses and sufferings of the army would not have been greater than those which attend the ordinary casualties of war and that when the injunctions of our military brethren were attended to the health of our troops soon became most satisfactory Dr Balfourthen of the Royal Military Asylum Chelsea whose authority is entitled to the greatest attention and respectwrites that so far as I can learn from competent judges there has been an amount of good surgery which sur passed the anticipations of even the best friends of the depart ment and I believe we are far ahead of the French army in that respect The wars which compare with that in South Africa in regard to length of the struggle numbers of wounded and strain upon the Army Medical Department are the Peninsular and Crimean wars the American war of the Rebellion and the FrancoGerman war Many lesser campaigns have intervened such as the Egyptian and the Indian wars and the struggle between China and Japan but these are not epochmaking like the other great wars and do not constitute milestones along the march of military medical progress In considering this question we must also remember there is much concerned beside the mere treatment of wounds There is the organisa tion of the Medical Corps the improvement in the means of transport of sick and wounded the formation of hospitals and the commissariat supply We scarcely remember it now but chloroform was first 4Q mwSalWAR SURGERY OLD AND NEW Aug 24 i9o tested on a large scale in the field during the Crimean cam paign and its success was complete Mcleod says there was but one death which can fairly be said to have arisen from it Baudens tells us that chloroform was administered some 25000 times in the French army and that no fatal case had occurred It was found even more precious in the field than in civil practice by relieving shock and permitting many primary amputations which could not otherwise be performed Fewer assistants are required when it is employed which materially adds to its value Mr Blenkins of the Guards remarks that without the aid of chloroform many severe operations could not have been undertaken or performed at all The next great war was that of the American Rebellion and the records of its results are to be found in the monumental volumes issued from the SurgeonGenerals office In the AustroGerman war of 1866 antiseptic surgery had not been introduced nor was it employed during the Franco German war of 187071 except to a quite limited extent upon the German side The mortality after operation was then very great indeed on both sides and especially in the French army All kinds of infective diseases prevailedsepticaemia pyaemia and tetanus were common most indeed of the operation cases died pyaemic suppuration was universal gangrene and secondary haemorrhage were frequent Wounds of large joints entailed fatal results abdominal wounds were scarcely ever recovered from and onehalf or more of the cases of chest injuries died Fractures of long bones were always very serious especially those of femur  amputations were frequent and attended by a large mortality  while excisions of joints in the lower limb at all events were most unsatis factory if performed as primary operations A very large proportion of those who died on the field of battle if not killed immediately perished from haemorrhage Operations however were almost invariably performed with the assist ance of chloroform and an infinite amount of suffering was thus saved The large bullets of former campaigns weighing often twice as much as those now in use inflicted most extensive damage both on the soft parts and the bones the comparative mag nitude of the injury and the imperfect means of guarding against sepsis offer a sufficient explanation of the high rate of mortality In the war between Russia and Turkey a systematic at tempt was first made by Professors Bergmann and Reyher to treat gunshot wounds of the knee antiseptically with very great and at the time astonishing success In the campaign in Egypt in 1882 antiseptic methods were so effectively car ried out that there was not throughout a single case of ery sipelas pyaemia or septicaemia or of any infective preventable disease I do not mean in this brief communication to enter into minute details or to give you many statisticsindeed from South Africa there are as yet no complete ones available I would only seek to indicate in a general way some of the improved conditions of modern warfare as exemplified in South Africa The use of chloroform was universal and that not less blessed agent in relieving pain morphine in this way the detrimental influence of shock was much lessened But hock is less severe in the case of the modern bullet than previously was the case due no doubt to the different cha racter of the wound The limited amount of local damage produced in most in stances by the comparatively small and very swift LeeMetford or Mauser bullet has impressed all observers The normal external wound is circular and quite small like the end of an ordinary pencil and it soon became sealed with a black cab of dried blood The exit wound is often quite similar or like a small slit and closes in the same way The soft parts and bone are damaged as a rule in a limited degree and recovery generally took place rapidly and without com plication The bullet seems to be itself aseptic  clothing is very seldom carried in with it  the bullet track behaves more like an incised wound than a contused one  the rapid manner in which the small external wounds seal up reduces the injury to the subcutaneous form and the frequency of recovery is proportionately great The manner in which the bullet may traverse the abdomen thorax cranium the great joints and important viscera not only without entailing a fatal result but often producing only a minimum of constitutional or other disturbance must be witnessed to be realised I was much impressed with the small number of cases of primary fatal haemorrhage and the large number of traumatic aneurysms The large vessels even including the innomi nate artery may be wounded by a bullet without causing fatal bleeding and often with a surprisingly small amount of haemorrhage either external or internala totally new expe rience In the Crimea and in the FrancoGerman war the estimated proportion of deaths from primary haemorrhage on the field of battle was about 20 per cent and it was thought beforehand that the small hardened bullet would probably greatly increase the number but this is not true and in South Africa and in the Cuban war death from this cause was found to be compara tive rare The same comparative infrequency may be stated in respect of secondary haemorrhage Wounds of the blood vessels are generally followed by aneurysmal swellings sometimes arterial more frequently arteriovenous The treatment of these cases is difficult and many I am convinced should if possible be left alone Unless immediate interference is indicated by some urgency such as fresh haemorrhage pressure symptoms or impending gan grene the longer the interval permitted before operation the better the prospect of ultimate success besides some cases get well spontaneously In those operated upon the ligation of the vessels at the seat of injury remains for most cases the classic and safest treatment but it is often attended by the greatest difficulties and often followed by gangrene The treatment of the larger proportion of Mauser wounds is generally of the expectant kind and of none may this be more correctly stated than of wounds involving the abdominal cavity Many surgeons went to South Africa anticipating a large field of surgical enterprise in this direction but I feel sure the surgical records of the campaign when published will prove the advantages of noninterference in the greater num ber of instances and this has also been the experience of the American surgeons in the war with Spain where the weapons used were precisely similar There all the abdominal cases but one operated on died while many treated expectantly recovered but the general mortality was as high as 70 per cent of the total while in the Civil War the mortality reached 87 per cent The liver kidneys and spleen may be perforated and yet recovery ensue The large intestine and I believe the small intestine also must have been frequently perforated without fatal consequences The small perforation caused by the Mauser bullet and the frequently empty condition of the bowel are the principal factors to account for a nonfatal issue In every region of the body the percentage of cases terminating fatally is diminished Formerly a gunshot frac ture of the femur formed a serious menace to life and deter mined not infrequently an immediate amputation In the Civil War of 6576 fractures of the femur nearly 3000 2923 were treated by primary amputation and the mortality following the injury amounted to 50 per cent In the SpanishAmerican war of 82 cases of gunshot of femur 6 only were amputated while 74 were treated conserva tively We do not yet know the mortality results in South Africa nor do I know of any uncomplicated case of gunshot fracture of the femur treated by primary amputation I fancy there must have been very few Recovery was looked I upon as the ordinary result although union was often con siderably delayed and the risk to life and limb was increased the higher up the fracture  while possibly 15 to 20 per cent were amputated for various causes later on I think the record of this war will show amazingly few primary ampu tations for injury but a certain number had to be performed

and complete recovery followed in a few days In other cases there was more or less haemothorax and in a few pyothorax  what the ultimate mortality table may show we do not yet know but it will not be very large In the FrancoGerman war half the cases terminated fatally and in the Civil War the mortality was as high as 626 per cent It may be taken as proved that a Mauser or Metford bullet may traverse the knee and other articulations and fracture the bones entering into the joint without causing any risk to life or limb or even any permanent disablement The old difficulty as to amputation or resection did not arise the treatment was expectant suppuration was rare and when passive movement was commenced sufficiently early excellent functional results followed In the sketch to which I have limited myself I think enough has been said to show how completely the character of gunshot injuries is changed Their severity is not only diminished but also their relative frequency so that the pro gressive improvement in lethal weapons does not appear to render the prosecution of war more difficult or to render it impossible as some have recently contended In the American Civil War 1 man was killed for every 44 wounded while with the Mauser bullet the proportion of killed to wounded is 1 to 7 j Only 6 to 8 per cent of those wounded now die whereas In the Civil War the percentage was 14J this is due no doubt to the altered character of the injuryand also in no small measure to improvements in the method of treatment It has often been forgotten what a complete change there is in the battles of this present war from any that have gone before Stress is placed upon our losses but they are almost insignificant in comparison with those of former times In the Crimea they reached nearly half our strength There was no trained transport corps nor hospital service nor adequate system for the care of the wounded on the battle field at the beginning of the war and numbers died on board the ships transporting the sick and wounded to Scutari in consequence of the inadequate preparation although it is a journey of only 36 hours Now the enemy is for the most part unseen and the smoke less powder fails to give any sign of his whereabouts At some of the earlier battlesthat of Colenso for instancethe Boers were invisible during the entire day  not a single Boer was seen by our men and the result was that the enemy only lost 5 killed and 25 wounded  while on our side there were 1100 casualties What a contrast is this to the early battles of the Franco German war with their brilliant cavalry charges and their masses of men hurled at the objective without heed of the loss incurred  they were literally decimated At Gravelotte on August 16th 1870 each side had 16000 men placed hors de combat On the 18th two days later occurred the terrible struggle of St Privat where 120000 French were pitted against 180000 Germans The artillery the mitrailleuses chassepots and needleguns plied against one another in the open Five times Steinmetzs sharpshooters were driven back and many corps lost half their officers The Prussians were repeatedly repulsed with fearful loss and at 7 in the evening Bazaineand his officers considered the field was won But at 9 the Prussians again attacked and in the early morning the Royal Guards advanced up the exposed slopes of St Privat against Canrobert They assaulted one position after another in superb fashion but the slaughter was dreadful  almost all the principal officers were struck down the colours exchanged hands several times and 160 German officers and 4000 soldiers were laid low in the attempt Nevertheless the Germans poured in regiment after regiment 14 Saxon batteries of artillery were added to the ten Prussian ones and as the sun was setting the Saxon regiments of the Guard drums beating and trum pets calling rushed at the double on Canroberts forces there was fighting in the streets in the houses in the ceme tery man to man with bayonet and butt end of musket and the place was taken The French lost that day 12000 men and the Germans more than 20000 amongst them the flower of the army for the Prussian Guard had 300 officers and 8000 soldiers either wounded or killed One of them was Langenbecks son who told me he had spent many long hours in search of him only to find him mortally wounded The Germans nearly lost the battle and would certainly have lost had Bazaine come to the assistance of his colleague He heard the guns and was informed of the situation by Marshal Leboeuf yet he never left his office at Plappeville Soon afterwards Moltkes supreme knowledge shut him up helpless with 170000 men in Metz and a little later on October 29th Metz la Pucelle and all this great French army was forced to surrender In some of the great Napoleons battles as many as 38 per cent were disabled  at Waterloo the number was 24 per cent At Koeniggratz the bloodiest battle of the war of 1866 it was 7 per cent At Mars le Tour it was 16 per cent and at Sedan 12 per cent I was there that day September ist 1870 when the French lost 3000 killed and 14000 wounded not very far short of our total loss for the entire period of the war in South Africa During twentyone months of this war from the beginning up to the end of June 4355 officers and men have been killed in action 18291 were wounded and 1493 or 81 per cent of the wounded died Modern troops in the field are now supplied with a packet of antiseptic material called a  first field dressing It is hermetically sealed and carried in a special pocket in each soldiers jacket If a surgeon be near he applies the gauze contained in the packet to the wound and fastens it on with the bandage supplied  or the wounded man himself does it or his comrade for him as every man is taught its use and application It certainly helps somewhat and comforts the wounded  but I do not myself much believe in its antiseptic adequacy and it often slips out of place Later on the Roentgen rays are of great service  they localise the foreign body when lodged and determine the ex tent and direction of a fracture They should serve to abolish the use of the probe which is a fertile cause of mischief and of needless pain and suffering Before the regimental system ceased to be each regiment had a surgenmajor and two assistant surgeons In time of peace there was very little for them to do except to look after a few sick in the regimental hospital In time of war they accompanied their regiments into action as at Waterloo and in the Crimea and tended the wounded often under fire When the regiment moved on the wounded had perforce to be left behind to the chance care of such persons as could be found to look after them and there was practically no or ganised system of transport field hospitals and bearer com panies The organisation of the transport of wounded from the field to the field hospital and thence to the stationary and base hospitals is now very complete and worked well in South Africa Formerly the wounded might have to lie for days untended now they are looked after with the least pos sible delay and passed along the continuous relief chain from the front to the base with a minimum of hardship and delay I myself saw many who had been exposed after Sedan for three or four days and some were even longer without any succour The hospital ships and hospital trains are comparatively new departures and of immense value in modern warfare The ships were I consider something as near perfection as anything human can be and the hospital trains did splendid work One officer I knewMajor BrazierCreaghlived for twelve months in one of these trains almost constantly on the move During the period of twelve months and six weeks that Major BrazierCreagh commanded this train he conveyed 16485 officers and men from the battlefields and along the lines of communication covering a distance of 34473 miles The train was several times under fire and was shelled on two occasions It was also in collision and more than once in imminent risk of being wrecked by the Boers  and the Princess Christian Train made 102 journeys carried 7000 patients and traversed over 30000 miles up to June last and is still at work with the same staff of surgeons and nurses on board as at the beginning At the battle of Colenso before the firing had ceased a hospital train was loaded with 120 wounded men every one of whom had been previously dressed and otherwise attended to by the bearer companies This train with its occupants The Undermanning Of The Army Medical

Highness the Maharaja Sindhia of Gwalior GCSI AMBULANCE CHALLENGE SHIELD The Council of the Volunteer Medical Association have arranged that the final competition for the Ambulance Challenge Shield at present held by the 2nd Volunteer Battalion Royal Fusiliers shall take place this year on Saturday June ist at Wellington Barracks Regiments intend ing to compete should signify the same without delay to the Honorary Secretary SurgeonMajor de Zouche Marshall Shortwood Teddington from whom all particulars can be obtained Owing to Her late Majestys death the volunteer medical officers annual mess will not take place this year THE DEADLOCK IN THE RAMC An Old Medical Officer writes that the present deadlock in the RAMC has something to do with the abolition of the old regimental system supplemented by a  medical staff Economy is at the root of the present condition of thingsa scrape along on a bare peace establishment with no allowance for pestilence and war The break down in China in i860 was directly caused by the War Office superseding the Indian arrangements with which the war began The same kind of thing has happened during the Boer warthe attempt to carry on a great campaign with a medical establishment not even sufficient for peace duties The soldier should be taught to look upon the medical department as something to fall back upon when he is sick or wounded not as a starved branch of the army He recommends that competition should be abolished the old system of nomination with a qualifying examination only maintained THE RAMC AND THE PROPOSED COMMISSION SurgeonMajor Frederick W Gibbon ist Durham VRE writes  I notice in the British Medical Journal of April 13th a letter from Dr Edward Thompson MP in which he suggests paragraph 8  Six months military training at Netley or Aldershota surgeon should know enough battalion and company drill to take charge ot the men of his own corps when necessary Yet it distinctly lays down that a combatant officer who joins the medical branch loses his previous ser vice in counting for promotion I know I had three and ahalf years  combatant and seven years rank service lost in promotion yet I have found that service of most use to mein connection with my volunteer I career I frequently come across volunteer medical officers going up for examinations who are at a loss to know how to get a company from one side of a square to another or do any simple squad movement I would suggest that all medical students take out commissions in the I volunteer force for when qualified this training would be of immense  value to them whether they entered as a volunter or army medical officer and it should form part of one of the regulations for entrance that is not less than twelve months rank on combatant service in a volunteer militia or line regiment previous to joining the medical staff SUGGESTIONS ON THE REORGANISATION OF THE ARMY MEDICAL SERVICE RAMC sends us a very lengthy communication on this subject He writes  The establishment of a Government medical school or cadet school does not seem advisable  the present competition is better  butr as an alternative might not the various universities or schools at a fixed percentage have the power to nominate to commissions  Com petitors should be at once commissioned and pass to Netley for special instruction in subjects connected with the Army Medical Service This instruction should last for twelve months and embrace both theoretical and practical study in advanced medicine and surgery hygiene bacteri ology administration etc A number of medical officers of each rank should be annually sent to study particular subjects and to afterwards lecture on them at the stations where they may be quartered so that the knowledge thereof may filter through the entire service The Militia Medical Corps should be reconstituted and to bear the same relation to the militia as the RAMC does to the regulars The Volunteer Medical Corps should be similarly constituted and wear one uniform Courses for the militia and volunteers to be held at various large con venient centres and at Netley as a head school under a senior medical officer Rank in the auxiliary forces should correspond with that in the regular army The RAMC in peace should be organised in field hospitals and bearer companies to be allotted to fixed stations  reliefs to be effected by interchange of officers and men of companies Officers not required with companies should be allotted to base hospitals The companies should be filled up to war strength on hostilities In field service all orderlies should be carried in carts or ambulances  mounted companies should have permanent transports  dismounted to be horsed by ASC Light twowheeled carts should be allotted to com panies Lighter ambulances should be provided Motor ambulances should be provided where the country is suitable Reserves should be formed of  i Officers and men who have served in the RAMC 2 Trained St John Ambulance men 3 Others who may volunteer An increase of regimental stretcher bearers is not advisable under modern conditions of small arms fire Young medical officers should be attached to regiments for two years Principal medical officers should be on the staff of the general officer commanding MEDICOLEGAL AND MEDICOETHICAL GUYS HOSPITAL MATERNITY CHARITY On May gth Mr A Braxton Hicks held an inquest at Lambeth on the body of George Ernest Eyre aged five days the son of a printers labourer living at

Langley a midwife attached to Guys Hospital Maternity Charity residing at 10 St Thomass Street SE the Institution deposed that she attended Mrs Eyre in her confinement The child was expected about that time Witness was sent for on Sunday May 5th and went back again The baby was born before she got there the second time Mrs Lloyd said it was a natural presentation Witness attended to thes mother and child The latter was a little discoloured but quite normal On the Monday afternoon at about 2 oclock witness again visited and she paid a further visit on Tuesday or Wednesday when the child was appar ently all right  she saw nothing the matter with it It was not a larges child One of her assistants then took over the caseone of her pupils She was there first and sent for witness The Coroner surprised  You have pupils do you  Where is it going to stop  Pupils will be having pupils too I suppose I am not surprised what the medical journals say about this midwife business Although you are a certificated midwife when a call is made you send a pupil who finds something wrong and then you go Do not you think you should have called the obstetric physiciana qualified practitioner  Witness  I often have cases like this The Coroner  And I have often to hold inquests because a medical man who could give a certificate is not called and midwives take too much upon their own shoulders Witness went on to say that the nurse told her of the death at 9 oclock on Friday morning and she asked Dr Sime the physician to see the child The Coroner  You did not see it

not give a certificate because he only saw the child after death First of all this certificate is incorrect as to the date of death It is on paper headed  Guys Hospital which gives it an official

1890 with a well marked scirrhus of the left breast The whole breast was removed as well as the axillary lymphatics and those subjacent tfco the pectoral muscles The examination of the tumour proved it to be a cancer of the typical scirrhus type The whole of the wound healed by first intention with the excep tion of the sternal end where for some unknown reason sup puration occurred and the stitches had to be removed for drainage Healing was very slow but in about a month she left the hospital with a small superficial granulating surface uncicatrised She returned once or twice for dressing and then disappeared for some months During her stay in ttiospital absolutely nothing suggestive of leprosy was observed On the contrary with the exception of the breast tumour she looked a healthy and exceptionally fat woman The breasts were very large and adipose In July 1899 about six months after the above operation she returned to hospital and on examining the cicatrix a wartylooking patch was found near the inner end and on the upper side with a few hard illdefined nodules along the inner half of the cicatrix She would not remain in hospital at this time but about iiwo weeks later she returned complaining of what she called erysipelas of the face Her face presented a number of deep red elevated shiny swellings more or less symmetrically arranged and giving the patient a sensation of intense heat or burning The sites of these patches were the supra orbital regions the malar prominences along the lower jaw and over the chin Similarlooking patches were found on her arms and legs Some of them were in the shape of large rings chiefly about the elbows and on the forearms the enclosed skin having a bleached and dry look Most of these areas were completely or partially ansesthetic anaesthesia was also found over extensive areas of the legs chiefly on the outer aspect of the right leg and left ankle On examining the mammary region there was found around the part of the cicatrix that had healed by granulation an extensive area of kin with the same deep red hue  the skin looked very coarse and had a brawny feel The patient stated that the  ery sipelas began first at this place and afterwards appeared on the face and limbs During her stay in hospital several fresh patches appeared on the legs and arms having the ame characteristics Dr Lutz saw the patient with me at this stage and agreed that she had a very acute infection of leprosy The woman who belonged to the lower class had been many years in Brazil Her husband died some years ago as the result of an accident She had one married daughter and neither her husband nor daughter ever suffered from any disease like hers By chance I learned from a visitor that the woman had a son who was suffering from a skin I disease and I succeeded in examining this son He was a youth of 18 who for three years had been suffering from typical leprosy of the mixed tubercular and anaesthetic form His face had the wellknown leonine expression and the alae nasi and lobes of the ears presented welldeveloped tubercles On his legs and arms he had deeplypigmented blotches and numerous anaesthetic areas Since his illness became pronounced he has always lived with his mother This case is a very interesting one furnishing as it does very strong evidence that the bacillus leprae can find an entrance through an open wound In all my experience of leprosy now extending over some sixteen years this is the first case in which I have been able to discover with any degree of certainty the source and mode of infection I1 W Loudon Strain MB CM Surgeon to the Hospital Samaritano Sao Paulo Brazil REPORTS ON MEDICAL AND SURGICAL PRACTICE IN THE HOSPITALS AND ASYLUMS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE PRETORIA HOSPITAL TRANSVAAL A DERMOID CYST IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCROTUM I OPERATION By Herbert J Godwin MB BS MRCS LRCP late Civil Surgeon to the South African Field Force  Acting Surgeon to the Pretoria Hospital Transvaal Colony W A G was admitted suffering from a swelling of the right side of the scrotum about the size of a cocoanut HistoryThe patient a fairly healthylooking man aged 42 stated that he had always had a swelling on the right side of the scrotum He was a married man and had had seven children six of whom were living He also stated that his father had a similar swelling and also his the patients eldest son This swelling gave him no trouble till a few months previously and just before the British occupation of Pietersburg Transvaal Colony he consulted a medical man who tapped it and drew off a small quantity of fluid He then came to Pretoria and consulted another medical man who tapped it and injected it with iodine Three days later the swelling became much larger and very painful Condition on AdmissionThe right side of the scrotum was enormously swollen red and fluctuating The superficial veins were very large and prominent The swelling was very tense and painful to touch The left testicle was normal Operation The patient was put under chloroform and a free incision made  putrid gas and pus came out in abund ance This collection was between the tissues of the scrotum and tunica vaginalis The tunica itself was found to be very much thickened  an incision was made into it and on intro ducing the finger the whole cavity was found to contain hair and cartilage with signs of commencing suppuration The cord was then tied and the whole mass removed The cord was twice as large as normal the arteries and veins being the same Examination of the TumourIt was found to be a cyst the wall of which was quite J inch thick  it was completely nlled with a mass of brown hair and projecting from the inner walls of the sac were pieces of cartilage an inch in length  no signs of any testicular substance could be found anywhere The cord which was very thickened seemed to spread out over the sac just after its exit from the external ring The vessels from the cord surrounded the sac in a tortuous manner and were very large AfterHistoryThe patient made an uninterrupted re covery RemarksThis case seems of interest for the following reasons 1 That dermoid cysts in this region are very un common  2 that when they do occur an atrophied testicle or some remains of a testicle are generally to be found 3 the fact that the patients father and the patients eldest son had a similar swelling  4 the difficulty of

Aneurysmal Varix J D a Boer prisoner of war aged about 40 was admitted on May 9th 1900 suffering from the effects of a bullet wound of the left thigh received at Rooidam on April 5th  range unknown The bullet was probably a LeeMetford and had entered the front of the thigh 4 inches above the patella passed upwards and backwards and emerged 3 inches below the gluteal fold The wounds were healed on his admission About 10 inches below Pouparts ligament in the line of the femoral vessels there was a rounded pulsating swelling 4j inches in diameter  the pulsation was expansile and was accompanied by a very distinct thrill which could be traced upwards as far as Pouparts ligament and downwards to the popliteal space There was also a continuous rough murmur audible all along the course of the vessels an excellent example of the bee in a paper bag sound No oedema of leg The patient was unable to walk without the assistance of a thick stick  he complained of weakness in the limb and shooting pains down the inner side of the leg as far as the ankle The diagnosis of arteriovenous aneurysm was made TreatmentHe was placed on calcium chloride in full doses three times a day and kept at absolute rest in bed for three weeks without any effect afterwards instrumental compression of the femoral artery was given a trial but caused no improvement His heart and arteries being appa rently healthy it was decided to operate and on July 17th the vessels were exposed in Hunters canal by the usual in cision On drawing the artery to one side it was seen that a communication existed between it and the vein  the latter vessel was considerably enlarged and pulsated visibly but there was no proper sac The artery and vein were now sepa rately ligatured above and below the point of communication and about 1 inch of each vessel removed The incision was closed in the usual manner without any drain and the leg wrapped in cotton wool and elevated No ill effects followed the operation the wound healed rapidly there was neither loss of temperature in the limb nor oedema He was dis charged on September 22nd 1900 able to walk without a stick and apparently suffering no inconvenience Case 2 Traumatic Aneurysm Boer prisoner W P van A aged 32 admitted May 9th 1900 for bullet wound of right thigh Like the previous case he was wounded at Rooidam on April 5th Projectile Lee Metford bullet  range unknown Condition on AdmissionThe entrance wound was in front of the thigh over the beginning of Hunters canal and the exit at a slightly lower level behind The thigh was very much swollen and a tense pulsating tumour existed in the region of the injury  the tumour was diffuse in character and painful pulsation ceased on compression of the main vessels at Pouparts ligament a rough systolic bruit was present No pulse could be felt below the level of the knee There was no oedema TreatmentThe tumour gradually increased in size and pain shooting down the leg became more constant On May 12th an incision about 4 inches in length was made over the line of the artery in the upper portion of Hunters canal Be neath the fascia the intermuscular planes were found exten sively infiltrated with blood clot On the clot being cleared out and the femoral vessels exposed in the canal a punctured wound was found in the femoral artery the vein being un injured The artery was ligatured above and below the wound and divided between the ligatures the cavity irrigated with sterilised water and the wound closed There was never any loss of heat or oedema in the leg after the opera tion He made an excellent recovery and was allowed up on June ist and eventually handed over to the authorities as a prisoner of war

HJEMATOMA By E L Luckman MRCS LRCP Surgeon to the Hospital Mrs E aged 25 married about five months consulted me about her condition HistoryShe had been quite regular each month until after marriage About two and ahalf years previously whilst shaking some carpets she complained of pains in the left side below the ribs  and since then she had suffered great discomfort and noticed that side of the abdomen was in creasing in size Any exertion proved troublesome she suffered from indigestion and constipation State on ExaminationThe patient was cheerful in dis position of pale complexion height about 4 feet 11 inches Examination of the abdomen showed a large tumour filling the whole of the left side and extending to the right of and below the umbilicus There was dulness on percussion in the left lumbar region The surface was smooth slightly notched at its lower part and in the umbilical region felt like a cyst on digital compression Operation August 2nd 1900After the usual aseptic ablution of the abdomen Dr J Maclaren administered the anaesthetic Assisted by Messrs W O Jones Golland and Ransome I opened the abdomen making an incision four inches long in the middle line below the umbilicus The tumour was easily pushed into view a patch on its surface about two inches in diameter had a greenish appearance and was somewhat tough It was surrounded by a fringe of peritoneum I inserted my fingers and gradually separated this from the splenic tumour which was then free with the exception of its attachment to the pancreas and the vessels entering the spleen The cyst was aspirated and forty ounces of a sanguineous fluid withdrawn The spleen was next care fully drawn through the abdominal incision and a silk cord ligature tied firmly round the short pedicle embracing the splenic artery vein lymphatics and a little of the tail of the pancreas and divided The cut end of the pedicle was care lully examined for any oozing The abdomen was flushed with a warm saturated solution of boracic acid until there was little or no discoloration of the fluid The pedicle appearing satisfactory was returned to the abdomen The wound was closed by ten silk sutures through the peritoneum abdominal muscles and skin dusted with iodoform and boracic acid over which was placed a pad of iodoform gauze salembroth wool strapped and bandaged Time occupied operation and dressing an hour and a half AfterHistoryThe patient had a little vomiting after the operation which was easily controlled She passed a good night The wound was dressed on the fifth day and the sutures removed on the eighth The patient made an un interrupted recovery and left the hospital in five weeks She quickened ten days after the operation and on December 28th 1900 was safely delivered of a male child iolbs in weight the patient herself weighing less than 120 lbs Since the operation her health has been remarkably good with the exception of the last two months of pregnancy when she had purpura of the upper and lower extremities which passed away soon after the birth of the child The spleen was partly solid and partly cystic Dr Coutts of Owens College kindly examined the fluid which was dark brownish red in colour specific gravity about 1030 contained large amount of albumen many blood corpuscles and a large number of cholesterine crystals The tumour six months after operation after it had been kept in spirit weighed 12 ozs Blood eight months after operation haemoglobin 62 per cent The Dental Hospital of London

OF THE British Jfeucal tesoctatton Held at Cheltenliam July 30th 31st August 1st and 2nd 1901 PROCEEDINGS OF SECTIONS SECTION OF NAYY ARMY AND AMBULANCE Deputy SurgeonGeneral W G Don MD President INTRODUCTORY REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT ON THE WORK OF THE SECTION The Section over which I have the honour to preside was inaugurated last year under auspicious circumstances and this its second meeting promises to be equally successful The President of last year InspectorGeneral innis RN in his opening address said that he deemed it a happy omen that the new Section of the Association was inaugurated while the great war which he hoped was near an end had con centrated public attention on the medical services His anticipation of the early end of the war has unfortunately not been realised  it has gone on and afforded still further object lessons in all our military departments including the medical  while the reforms suggested in various directions have yet to be worked out and practically applied The objects and scope of this Section are wide and compre hensively expressed in its title  it may be taken to embrace matters relating to the personnel organisation and equipment and to the hygiene and surgery of our naval and military ser vices both in peace and war  while on the civil side it in cludes such problems as the provision of ambulances and emergent aid to sick and injured persons especially in our populous urban centres To facilitate procedure during the three days at our dis posal we propose to discuss  first naval  secondly military  and thirdly civil matters so far as can be arranged On naval questions we are prom i sed papers by naval medical officers on most important subjects  namely the disposal of wounded in naval actions and the relative healthfulness of modern warships to which attention has lately been called  will not venture to anticipate what may be said on these matters further than to remark that while we probably have data sufficient for arriving at some definite conclusions as to the healthfulness of ironclads our experience is as yet very limited regarding the disposal of the wounded in modern sea fights The subject is complicated on account of the many different structural types of our warships each requiring special contrivances of their own I may be allowed to express much personal interest in such naval problems because of lasting early experiences  for it was my fortune to learn some thing of the interior economy of our wooden walls of fifty years ago having served for six months as a medical volunteer in HMS Duke of Wellington flagship of the Baltic Fleet of 1855 and taken part in the three days bombardment at Sweaborg Such a reminiscence brings the obvious reflection how mar vellously and completely have naval life and warfare changed within my own limited recollection  With the military medical problems which may engage our attention I am after fortyfour years consecutive and con tinuous service in the army naturally very fairly conversant I confess I regard these problems after the experience of many mutations both in the home and Indian services as still presenting grave difficulties and even dangers unless warily and judiciously handled Major Dick RAMC Assistant Professor of Military Surgery Netley was to have recounted some aspects of smallbore wounds as inflicted during the war which have come under his direct ob servation but we regret his inability to do so But Sir William MacCormac has promised some observations on War SurgeryOld and New to which his great experience 4 and authority will lend the highest interest We already know sufficient of such wounds to warrant the antici pation that when the full surgery of the war is made known we shall have some startling revelations especially in regard to penetration of viscera by smallbore bullets I lately saw a wounded soldier on sick furlough who while lying down was hit by a Mauser bullet the missile entered the right chest below the armpit and passing in a slanting direction emerged in the region of the left kidney From its course and the resulting symptoms several of the important viscera could not have escaped penetration  yet months afterwards when I saw him the only inconvenience experienced was occasional spasm of the diaphragm on sudden exertion When we meet with such cases and can recall the terrible visceral wounds inflicted by the expanding Mini bullet of forty years ago or even by the still more recent Snider or Martini the pencillike missiles of the latterday magazine rifles seem comparatively almost harmless Field transport for sick and wounded on which Captain Ward RAMC promises to give his recent war experiences is a subject of great importance and some difficulty  for it is part of the bigger question of army field transport at large which cannot or ought not to be fixed and fettered by inelastic rules  because it must vary widely according with three factors which may operate in any given campaign These are  the physical nature of the country in which military operations are conducted  the length of the lines of communication  and the required mobility of the fighting force It is an open question whether the medical service should not have com plete autonomy in its field transport of whatever kind  but I am not inclined to lay much stress on the point further than that it should be autonomous subject alone to the express disposition of the general officer in command For necessity and especially military necessitycan have no law beyond or overriding that of preservation of the fighting force  and consequently however autonomous in theory the medical or other branches of transport may be there is always the risk even the probability that under the pressure of military exigency as after Paardeberg it may be appropriated for the supreme transport of food and ammunition Intimately bound up with the kind and amount of field medi cal transport is the question of its use under new conditions in affording first aid to the wounded in an action The enor mous widening of the zone of fire from modern weapons makes all active duties connected with stretchers and ambu lances increasingly difficult and dangerous It is now next to impossible with any safety for bearers to keep in touch with an advancing fighting line while the distances between the combatants may be so great as to render the distinguishing of red crosses and Geneva badges impossible  hence probably the complaints that the ambulances have been deliberately fired on Not only does the range of fire exceed that of unaided vision but the use of smokeless power makes location of a firing line more a matter of the ear than the eye  there is plenty of noise but little to be seen A wounded cavalry soldier told me he had been six times under fire but never once saw a living fighting Boer while engaged In means for affording civil first aid to sick and injured persons in our great urban centres we seem lamentably be hind many Continental and American cities We all trust this reproach may before long be removed It is a question whether motor might not be substituted for horse ambu lances for all emergent purposes Important questions con nected with enteric fever will be brought to your notice I have now the pleasure to invite you to proceed with the various matters that may come before us THE TREATMENT OF WOUNDED IN NAVAL ACTIONS By FleetSurgeon Gilbert Kirker RN MD MCh MRCS This subject may be conveniently dealt with under the three following heads  i The surgeons station or the place where the wounded are treated 2 The time of treatment 3 The conveyance of the wounded 2121J The Working Of The Refugee CampsSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2135 Nov 30 1901 pp

University of London and the students prepared for the degrees of the London University and if they began with chemistry and physics that was ample as it was all that the Council was concerned with If there was no proper instruc tion in chemistry they could not be signed up for it All the Council and the Registrar had to do was to let the student begin his first year at a proper institution  he began with che mistry and physics and he hadnothing to do with biology when he finished those subjects he went on to biology With re gard to the exclusion of technical schools it was only where those institutions in which technical education alone was provided for which were excluded  but if technical education and medical education as well was conducted by them then thy were included Dr Norman Moore was very sorry to press anything a lainst Newnham College but he maintained that to take aivrantage of surrounding circumstances was a different thing t  having a place adapted for teaching fitted up within its o vn walls  otherwise if that view were adopted a person living in London might have recourse to the British Museum However he had such a regard for Newnham College that he should be very unwilling to press it and if the Council could be satisfied that the College was teaching those subjects within its own walls then it should be included The amendment was then put and declared lost The President pointed out that the motion before the Chair was that the list of scientific institutions submitted by the Executive Committee be approved Dr McVatl thought that this matter should not be dis cussed until the report of the Education Committee had been considered because it was practically the admission of a number of institutions that wpre not medical schools If the motion was carried it would very greatly augment that list Therefore he proposed  That the farther consideration of the report oc the Executive Com mittee regarding the list of scientific institutions recognised by licensing bodies be postponed until after the Education Co nmittees report with regard to the conditions of admission to the Studmts Register has been considered Dr Glover seconded the motion Dr MacAlister was of opinion that the postponement would only further complicate matters as it was not certain that the Council could come to a final conclusion upon the Education Committees report with regard to the oonditions of admis sion to the Students Register  and there was the further fact that the list could be extended at anytime by taking the nroper means Many members were surprised at the omission from the list of certain wellknown science colleges but the reason of that was that those science colleges had not been recognised by the licensing bodies As soon as such recogni tion was obtained there would be no difficulty in increasing the list Mr George Brown supported the amendment because he intended later on to move that this Council should recognise pupilage with a medical man as part of the first years medical education The President pointed out that there were already cases before the Registrar awaiting some deliverance by the Coun cil as to the recognition of certain scientific institutions that was to say certain applicants for registration who desired to know whether certain of these institutions would be recog nised therefore there was a practical question involved in the consideration of this list It was obvious from what had fallen from Dr MacAlister and the report itself that this list was not a final one and he would observe that Scotland stood without a representative upon it He had pointed out the fact to Dr MacAlister but the answer he got was one he was obliged to accept namely that none of the schools in Scot land were recognised by the licensing bodies there but so soon as they were recognised by those licensing bodies the Committee would be prepared to admit them Sir William Thomson supported the postponement be cause it seemed to him that the question was important and was involved in the matter of the Education Committees report The amendment was then put when 14 voted for and 5 against and it was declared carried At the request of Dr Pettigrew the names and numbers were taken down The amendment was then put as a sub stantive motion and was declared carried Restoration of Names On the motion of Dr MacAlister the Council went into camera to receive a report from the Executive Committee in regard to certain applications for the restoration to the Medical Register of names removed under Section xxix of the Medical Act 1858 At 6 pm the Council adjourned no intimation being con veyed to the press THE WORKING OF THE REFUGEE CAMPS The volume of repoits etc on the working of the refugee camps has now become accessible and we are therefore in a position to attempt a summary of their contents This task is by no means an easy one as the reports simply follow each other in chronological order and to obtain a complete and continuous view of the different camps it is necessary to examine five different reports for each camp We propose to confine ourselves in the present article to the camps in the Transvaal which as shown in our former article have had a higher mortality than the camps in the Orange Colony and Natal Transvaal Camp The inmates of the different camps were divided in the first instance into three classes  i Those who have come into the camps for protection of themselves and their herds and are selfsupporting 2 Those who have surrendered and come into camp for protection but are unable to support themselves In this class would be included widows and orphans and the relatives of our prisoners of war 3 Those whose husbands are on commando and have been brought into camp for their own protection against natives etc or for military reasons It is noted March 22nd that it is difficult to treat with the liberality they deserve Classes 1 and 2 without incurring the reproach of having treated Class 3 with undue generosity The largest camps in the Transvaal are at Heidelberg Irene Johannesburg Potchefstroom Standerton and Volksrust The following statistical table shows the sickness and mortality experience in the Transvaal camps in the month of April The deaths for men women and children are massed together and cannot be differentiated but it is possible to give separately the sicknessrate among children For death rates the

improvement deterioration or a fairly stationary condition as regards sickness month by I month In the improving group Mafeking Camp takes a I prominent position  Johannesburg occupies a similar position I though how far this is due to the formation of Johannesbrg relief camps for which no vital statistics are given must be left in doubt Standerton occupies a fairly uniformly favur I able position while the statistics of Krugersdorp are even more favourable On the other hand Irene Camp has had a consistently bad record  so likewise has Middleburg  and the I conditions at Volksrust Petersburg Nylstroom and Vereeniging deteriorated It would be easy to extend our com parisons to the camps in the Orange River Colony and Natal  but such statistics would be wearisomeand the present examples will probably suffice to illustrate the causes of the more or less favourable statistics in the different camps Irene for instance has had a consistently bad record What are the facts recorded about it Dr George Turner the Medical Officer of Health of the Transvaal officially in spected the camp on the March 6th He reports that the latrines are well placed but that there are insufficient pails  and that the floors of the latrines require paving Pails for night use near the tents were also needed Slaughtering of sheep which was forbidden in the camp nevertheless was winked at to some extent The number of sick was great and something should be done to diminish the number of cases of diarrhoea He particularly urges that all milk be diluted with boiled water before being served out in view of the stupidity of the Boer mothers He notes that no care could have prevented the measles cases For the month of May at the same camp Dr Green the Medical Officer ascribes the heavy mortality to malaria dysentery and diarrhoea measles and pneumonia either caused or made worse by cold and insufficient clothing He also states that the average infantile mortality among Boers on their own farms is very great The tents were unsuitable for invalids allowing great extremes of temperature The medical and nursing staff was deficient in numbers In June Dr Woodroffe then medical officer of the Irene camp ascribes the high mortality to measles to excessive changes of temperature in the camps to the aversion of the Boers to fresh air and clean water to the absence of fresh milk and vegetables from the diet to the helplessness and callousness of many during sickness and their belief in disgusting remedies and their unwillingness to help one another For August it is reported that the constant importation of new inhabitants kept the measles going that the disgusting remedies used by the Boers made matters worse but that the sanitary condition of the camp is good It is stated that  A sharp watch has to be kept to prevent people emptying their slops at their front door In the tents of some slops and stools are allowed to remain for hours without being removed blankets and shawls are often used as diapers for babies with the result that the stench is unbear able The following disgusting details of Boer domestic medica tion remind one of mediaeval Europe  No one can imagine the difficulty a medical man has in preventing these people from using their dangerous useless and disgusting remedies Goat dung and wormwood made into a decoction and drunk in quantities is the favourite drippel or middel for bringing the measles out pieces of raw meat are bandaged over each eye in acute con junctivitis and most of these cases are caused by dirt Babies ears are receptacles for an endless variety of rubbish and consequently otorrh a is very common Rags wetted with human urine are used for open flesh wounds and so on Krugersdorp may be taken as an example of a camp with a very good record It is noted that in May the condition of the families brought in was deplorable as they were very short of clothing and bedding The food supply was how ever very good and the water excellent and there was little sickness The report for the month of June states that the camp is on sloping ground that it has been drained by deep trenches and that a reservoir for water large enough for the entire camp has been built The pail system was in use Only 8 deaths had occurred 3 from starvation the patients having been brought in in a dying condition In July measles was epidemic but the deathrate remained low The sanitary arrangements were excellent It would be easy to extend the preceding examples Suf ficient however has been adduced to indicate some of the main lessons of the camps  1 A large share of the high deathrate in them is ascribable I to the condition in which the women and children arrive j3 iSLBa54Ll JAMAICA AS A HEALTH RESORT Nov 30 ik Often they have been halfstarved and are broken down in health It cannot be wondered at that under these circum stances measles and other diseases are inordinately fatal 2 The dirty personal habits of the Boers their use of improper and often disgusting remedies and their ignorant errors of dietetics in regard to young children have rendered it extremely difficult to secure favourable results in the treatment of cases of sickness among the Boer children 3 There appears to be no doubt as indicated in our pre vious special article that the measles which has been preva lent has been of a specially malignant type Its malignancy has doubtless been intensified by the dirty condition of the Boer children and by the overcrowding that has been per mitted in the camps as well as by the previous bad health of these children 4 The present reports afford abundant evidence confirm atory of the conclusion at which we had previously arrived that dysentery diarrhoea and enteric fever in a large propor tion of the camps have been prevalent as well as measles 5 The fact that some of the camps have had but little of any of these diseases and that measles when it has been in troduced into them has had a relatively low fatality appears to indicate not merely differences in the condition of the Boer women and children on their arrival in camp but dif ferences in the subsequent management of the respective camps Numbers however as well as quality are required Doctors nurses and inspectors cannot do a superhuman amount of work  and in a large proportion of the reports there is complaint of an insufficient staff 6 It is clear that every attempt appears to have been made to provide necessary food clothing and medical comforts Sometimes these attempts failed but this was obviously not owing to lack of efforts in this direction 7 We had anticipated that an examination of the preced ing statistical tables prepared at great labour would have shown a regular relationship between magnitude of the camps and amouut of sickness and mortality Roughly speaking there is such a relationship but it is not uniform One or two of the smaller camps show a high mortality  several of the large camps particularly Krugersdorp Klerksdorp and Standerton show a low mortality This maybe partially due to the fortuitous nonintroduction of infection Internal evi dence seems however to show that it is due in a much larger degree to more efficient administration than that of the more severely scourged camps These facts do not in our opinion militate against the main conclusion whichwe urged in the previous special articlethat the camps should be split up and scattered and be placed on pure soil the maintenance of which in its pristine freedom from contamination by excreta or  slops  should be the constant care of a sufficient staff One of the chief causes of the recent high mortality has been the difficulty of getting the Boers to use latrines of prevent ing them contaminating the soil around their tents In some camps there has been much greater success in this matter than in others If the unsuccessful camps were moved and placed under efficient supervision and control great improve ment could almost certainly be effected JAMAICA AS A HEALTH RESORT From our Special Commissioner When in the early part of the year I was offered the opportunity of voyaging to Jamaica with the object of briefly reporting from personal observation on the capa bilities of that island as a health or pleasure resort I accepted with pleasure It was no small consideration to escape for more than four weeks from the rigour of this insular climate during the months of February and March As with most others too the very name of the West Indies was to me associated with a charm and romance above per haps those attaching to any other portion of the world The writings of Kingsley and Michael Scott recurred to one and with the younger and more ardent doubtless the writings of Marryat with the descriptions of lovely Creoles and dignity balls would have recurred with still more vivid force To visit for however brief a period some of the scenes these writers have described to view with ones own eyes the wondrous wealth and beauty of the tropical vegetation and to taste the numerous tropical fruits whose excellence could only be tested on their native soil made up a programme too enticing to be resisted The Voyage A drawback to Jamaica as a health or pleasure resort is to many its distance from this country some 4000 miles odd Formerly this disadvantage was enhanced by the fact that ito could be reached only by a line of steamers that called previously at several other West Indian islands or by going over to America and taking a long train journey south with a final sea trip of several days duration In either case by these routes the journey from England to Jamaica took the best part of three weeks By the establishment of the Imperial Direct West India Mail Service Elder Dempster and Co which runs a fortnightly service of boats direct to Jamaica and has in contemplation a weekly service in the near future a considerable reduction in the length of the journey has been achieved It now lasts about twelve days a less time than that occupied by going to Egypt by  long sea and many intending travellers to the East might fairly turn their faces Westward Ho  with both pleasure and profit to themselves Journeying down from Paddington on February 16th skating was going on in numerous places adjacent to the line and it was pleasant to think that in a couple of days or so one would be in a distinctly warmer clime where great coats would be an unnecessary encumbrance At Bristol we found the engine of the special boat train decorated with laurels and flags ours being the pioneer journey of the service and the same decorations were lavishly displayed on all sides on nearing Avonmouth So much time however was wasted on this short journey that one could have wished for less grandeur and more speed but it is not fair to cavil at the arrangements on an initial trip and doubtless on subsequent occasions every punctuality has been maintained As the arrival platform adjoined the wharf the vessel was easily reached from the train by walking through a covered shed The appearance of our shipthe Port Morant was a truly pleasing one Painted a pure white with an excellent promenade deck and other accommo dations she looked more like a steam pleasure yacht than a vessel designed for serious work in the North Atlantic She was one of the smaller boats of the fleet being slightly under 3000 tons burdenff most of the others ranging over 4000 tons In spite of several very minor defects which only actual experience at sea could reveal the Port Morant proved a trusty and seaworthy vessel capable of steaming at con siderably more than the guaranteed speed As she was the pioneer vessel of the service the whole of the inhabitants of Avonmouth and the district turned out to wish success to the enterprise which promises so much for the trade and prosperity of Bristol and the neighbourhood It soon appeared that the passengers were a community almost solely on pleasure bent and there was an absence of any distressing leavetakings and to the joyous strains of a band the waving of flags ancfe the continuous cheering of the crowd on shore we started on our long journey We carried rather more than forty our full complement of first saloon passengers one or two having to depend for sleep ing accommodation on the resources of the second saloon but this was no real hardship Including the surgeon to the ship there were no fewer than seven doctors on board most of then making the trip for the sake of health or pleasure A dis tinguished member of the medical coterie was Dr F W Mott who was suffering from some unpleasant sequel of influenza and it must be a source of universal gratifica tion that he came back restored to health to pursue his researches in neurology and pathological chemistry The first part of the voyage was somewhat rough but the weather in the North Atlantic at that time of the year is pro verbially uncertain It was not so rough however as to be unpleasant except to very bad sailors and it only gave rise to such minor inconveniences as the occasional having to dodge a dish at meals and the necessity of dealing the cards at bridge directly into each players hand as the motion of the vessel prevented their stopping on the table The latter part of the voyage was delightful and thoroughly enjoyed by every one on board The sea was quite calm and its intense blue surface was only broken by the frequent flight of myriads of Bills Of Mortality In South

reading It is of great importance however that they should be read and studied and an attempt has therefore been made to rearrange and classify the returns published weekly or monthly during the past year in such a form that their full meaning and magnitude can be easily grasped One difficulty in doing this is the variable strength of the army for which these returns have been made On February 8th loco MrWyndhamthenUnderSecretary for War stated that the total of British forces of all kinds in South Africa was about 194000 A return issued on December 6th gives the total strength on December ist 1900 of noncommissioned officers and men only as in round numbers 210000 In the first total officers are included but not in the second In the following table it has been assumed that the strength of noncommissioned officers and men has been throughout 200000 This assumption will imply that in the early part of Table I the deathrate from disease is somewhat under stated while in the latter part of the same table it is slightly overstated The error however is probably but small and Table I and the curve based upon it Fig 1 may be trusted as showing at least the

preceding weeks of the year occurred at the rate of 50 per week the total of deaths from disease during 1900 was 7501 which on an assumed strength of 200000 men gives a deathrate from disease of yjK per 1000 of strength To these must be added the killed in battle and those dying of wounds in South Africa not including any invalided home and 200 deaths from accident apart from battle and 92 prisoners who have died in captivity This gives a total casualty list for the year 1900 of 4318 noncommissioned officers and men or a casualty Jan 19 1901 BILLS OF MORTALITY IN SOUTH AFRICA

as 375 to 216 but if we make allowance for the number of invalids who have died on the way home or after reaching England it is highly probable that the death rate from disease has been about twice that from actual ing e figures as to invaliding deserve passing notice Since the commencement of the war 36986 noncommissioned officers and men as well as 1638 officers have been sent home as invalids or 185 per annum per 1000 of the total force It may be urged that as the total strength of the army has been maintained approximately at 200000 this statement as well as the deathrates already given exaggerate the real facts Many more than 200000 men have been in succession fighting in South Afriea in the Imperial forces and therefore the pro l portion of invalids being for a much larger number of men will be less than 185 per cent To argue thus is to contra vene an elementary point in statistics The deathrates and the invalidingrate so far given are annual rates and represent the experience for an entire year Assum ing the conditions to which they are exposed are identical the exposure of 600000 men for onethird of a year is only equivalent to the exposure of 200000 for an entire year Of the 36916 invalids sent home up to the end of 1900 5662 were wounded 30243 were sick and concerning 1081 it was not specified for which reason they were invalided Of the same number 243 had died when the return was issued 1570 have been discharged from the service as unfit and 654 are in hospital The preceding figures have an added significance when they are

for 1898 gives the data necessary for such a comparison The total deathrate of theField Force during 1900 has been approximately 59 per 1000 of strength the deathrate from disease alone being 375

available statistics do not enable us to state what proportion of the above enormous deathrate from disease during the Boer war is due to enteric fever There can be no doubt we think that enteric fever bulks largest in the returns which have been published Probably the four most common causes of death in the field army have been enteric fever dysentery respiratory diseases and rheumatic fever and probably also the order in which these diseases are given is the order of their importance in the death returns It is not unlikely that an annual deathrate of at least 10 per 1000 has been caused by enteric fever alone In one week that ending May 26th 1900 the deaths from disease were at a rate which if it had been continued throughout the year would have killed 94 out of every 1000 soldiers or on the above assumption 25 out of every 1000 soldiers would have died of enteric fever Whether the proportional mortality ascribed to enteric fever lias been as heavy as or more or less heavy than here sur mised it has undoubtedly been extremely heavy A few comparative figures will bring out this point It is to be noted that soldiers are at the most susceptible age for enteric fever and that new arrivals in countries like India and South Africa in which this disease is markedly endemic are more susceptible than inhabitants of an older date Deathrates from Enteric Fever per 1000 of Population or Strength England and Wales 5 years 189195 entire population  ol7 England and Wales 188190 Males aged 2025 o3U United Kingdom Troops 188796  os6 India  188695  5 6 South African  188589  137   189296  176 Thus while among the troops in the United Kingdom the deathrate from enteric fever is not dissimilar from that of the civil population at the same ages the deathrate from this disease among the troops in South Africa was excessive in the years preceding the Boer war and was about onethird to onefourth that among European troops in India The problem in South Africa so far as the prevention of enteric lever is concerned very closely resembles the same problem in India Although the preceding figures show that in past years enteric fever has been very prevalent among our troops in South Africa the experience of last year is altogether excep tional Over 200000 men have been subjected to conditions which were known to be a fertile cause of enteric fever and this experience has been associated with a mortality from this disease which is greatly in excesspossibly eight to ten times in excessof anything previously experienced in South Africa That the evils causing enteric fever in South Africa were known is shown by a Report on the Prevalence of Enteric Fever in Pietermaritzburg by Major R J Simpson MA MB which is published in the Report of the Army Medical Depart ment for 1898 Appendix No XI p 490 et seq This paper embodies a very careful study of enteric fever among the troops forming the peace establishment in South Africa and particularly among the 1400 soldiers stationed in the capital of Natal In this paper Major Simpson shows that  com paring two periods of five years each at the beginning and end of the period 188496 and excluding epidemic years the admission rate per 1000 from enteric fever has increased nearly fourfold while the deathrate has increased about one seventh The sources of this enteric fever were carefully investigated It was shown that the surroundings of the water supply of the town especially close to the intake warrant the gravest suspicion as to its purity On the problem of convection of infection by dust Major Simpson has some important remarks There is a relationship between deficiency of rain fall and prevalence of enteric fever not however through dust storms but in association with the rains following drought Thus  In 1890 there was a constant deficiency of rainfall from May to November followed by a rainfall in November 2 inches above the average The enteric began in December In the seasonal preva lence and at least in the occurrence of epidemics the same feature is recognisable that a prolonged dry season followed by a heavy rainfall is associated with a rapid increase in the number of cases of enteric fever In short the disease was chiefly waterborne In October 1896 a garrison order was published directing that all water used for drinking should be boiled and that measures should be taken to ensure its use The remark which follows the above statement is significant  It is however one thing to provide boiled water for drinking and another to ensure that nothing else is used even in camps There is abun dant evidence to show that the men were in the habit of drinking water regardless of its source when on route marches field days or walking out and as a matter of convenience probably the water nearest to the road or track they were pursuing They also habitually drank unboiled water from the taps in the ablution rooms Assuming however that the water supply could not be purified at its source what official is responsible for the con tinued supply of impure water to the soldiers at camp at Pietermaritzburg although recommendations as to the pro vision of filters were made by Major Simpson  The curve in Fig 1 shows a seasonal maximum at the end of May followed by a fall interrupted by a smaller rise in September The trend in the last three months is not so obvious This may be due to the fact that only monthly returns of deaths irom disease have been furnished This curve represents all fatal diseases It will be interesting to compare it with a curve of the ordinary seasonal incidence of enteric fever in South Africa This we are able to furnish by again drawing on Major Simpsons paper Fig 2Seasonal incidence of enteric fever in Natal Based on the dates of admission to hospital of347 cases of enteric fever in the years 188897 out of a total strength of 13196 The figures for each month indicate the percentage of the total annual cases  100 admitted in each month JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUNE JULY AUG SEP OCT Htv DICl It would appear therefore that at Pietermaritzburg and probably also in other parts of South Africa the maximum seasonal incidence of enteric fever is in December and Januaryr after which it gradually declines to a minimum in June August Epidemics of enteric fever frequently however disturb seasonal curves as the experience of last May Fig 1 too sadly proves It would greatly relieve the public mind to be assured that at this season of maximum incidence of enteric fever the army authorities had profited by the experience of last year and had grasped and grappled with the difficul ties of prevention of enteric fever as a practical problem in connection with which immediate action is required The Mortality In The Boer Concentration CampsAuthors R Hingston FoxSource The British Medical Journal

KilburnNW Oct 2Qth T MORTON MD SirIn all the correspondence upon this topic I have seen no reference to the archaic history of registration It may interest your readers and some of your correspondents to know the following which is given me by the learned and Venerable Archdeacon of Montgomery who besides being a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries is highly gifted both in reading and in observation From Phillimores Ecclesiastical Law page 2059 it appears that down to the passing of the Medical Act in 1858 bishops licensed physicians surgeons and midwives This was done partly in the interests of the Faculty to put a stop to impostors and charmers and especially for spiritual good The oath of midwives was very strict including  ItemYou shall not in any wise use or exercise any manner of witch craft charm or sorcery invocation or other prayers than may stand with Gods laws and the Kings ItemYou shall not give any counsel or minister any herb medicine or potion or any other thing to any woman being with child whereby she should destroy or cast out that she goeth withal before her time ItemYou shall not consent agree give or keep counsel that any woman be delivered secretly of that which she goeth with but in the presence of two or three lights ready With other regulations as to conduct The Archdeacon gives me some notes of physicians and surgeons in this St Asaph diocese so licensed for example  1665 Practicers of PhysickNone licensed or resident in the diocese  but one Dr Turner Thomas administers at Llanrwst Dr John Mostyn administers at Wrexham  Vaughan frequently at Denbigh All three Papists and 1756 At Abergeley licence for Surgery granted to Edward Griffith Gent by Robt Wynne DD Vicargeneral and official Principal of Isaac  Bishop of St Asaph Unfortunately at the time of writing no reference could be found of any midwife so licensed  but the Archdeacon has such a note somewhere The Medical Act of 1858 makes no mention of repealing any former Act Consequently it is a fair inference that the law under which such licencesand accordingly registrations were effected is still extantI am etc Colwyn Bay Oct 19th J LloydRoberts THE MORTALITY IN THE BOER CONCENTRATION CAMPS SirThe mortality of the children in the concentration camps in South Africa is large and appalling But I desire to point out that the method of estimation used in the article on the subject in the British Medical Journal of November 9th and which is generally employed in the press is very inaccurate It is not correct to estimate a yearly mortality by imply multiplying a monthly or weekly rate unless you i have evidence that the population remains stationary in namber8r that ism1iheprsent eafce unless the loss by death is compensated by gain from births and new arrivalsk As we do not know that this is so it would be safer if we want to estimate the effect of a constant rate of mortality for a year to treat it as operating on a diminishing populationthat is one which decreases each month by the number of deaths in such period A different result then comes out Thus the figures which you have given for the four months June to September show a monthly mortality of 267 per iooo chil dien or 1 in 37 as stated This would tell up not to 12 times 267 but to 2784 per 1000 in the year The statement that if the present conditions prevailed for three years all the Boer children now in the camps would be annihilated hardly needs refuting A population would never be wholly destroyed by a mortality of the highest rate imaginable unless it reached the integer since it operates necessarily on a constantly diminishing number As a fact it can easily be shown that if 1000 children are taken the mortalityrate in question would destroy not the whole 1000 but 623 of them in the course of three years I think however that considering the uncertainty of the numbers in the camps from one month to another and the influence of temporary epidemic or endemic causes it would be better to confine ourselves to the statement of a monthly rate of mortality which can be compared with the English or any other standard reduced from a yearly to a monthly rate for this purpose Where the rate is small as with us its multiplication or reduction to correspond with differing eriods of time is attended with little error The error is arge in the case of high rates such as those prevailing in the camps May I add that the deathrate of women which is in the camps so excessive is normally somewhat lower than that of men during the greater part of life but not  much lower as stated  I write thus in the plea for statistical accuracy not at all to detract from the purpose of your article which justly emphasises the terrible character of the loss now going on and the need for radical sanitary measures Probably we are far from the end of the troubles in this respect The breaking out of scurvy is to be looked for if the conditions are not greatly changedI am etc Finsbury Square EC Nov 11th R HlNGSTON Fox  The contributor of the article on the concentration camps writes  If Dr Hingston Foxs contention that annual deathrates based on weekly deaths cannot be correctly estimated holds good the weekly returns issued by the RegistrarGeneral stand condemned In truth however if it be remembered that they indicate a deathrate based on the facts of a given week they are not misleading Much less likely to mislead are deathrates based like those in the special article on the mortality statistics for four months This is a much larger slice of a year than a week and much more likely to repre sent the average experience of a year For the benefit how ever of those holding Dr Foxs views monthly deathrates were given which are statistically quite free from possible objection Dr Foxs contention that a decreasing population must be assumed is contradicted by the facts for the largest camps and therefore Dr Foxs alternative statement of deathrates is erroneous Dr Fox is right in his criticism of the statement that an annual deathrate among children of 1 in 3 would cause annihilation in about three years This does not however destroy the significance of the facts that 1 out of 37 children died during a month that during four months 1 out of 9 children died and that if this deathrate be continued for a year 1 out of every 3 will have died It should further be noted that the statement of proportion be tween English and concentration camp deathrate s among children as 31 to 180 which is sufficiently appalling does not allow for the fact that this assumes that all the children in the camps are less than 5 years old Wtre the correct ages given the excess of mortality among the children in the camps would be seen to be even more excessive than I have shown it to be Whether the dirty and insanitary habits of the Boers and especially of the Boer women be partially responsible for this or whether it be the civil or military authorities there is clearly urgent fed tor

CONCENTRATION CAMPSmwmSjl I49 In order to bring these statistics into manageable compass the experience of all the camps in the Transvaal Orange River Colony and Natal for the four months in question has been combined in the following table and placed in contrast with that of the small camp or camps in Cape Colony  Summary Table Number of Camps in  Deaths of Deathrate It is not assumed that the total number of inhabitants in the concentration camps is the number given in the first three columns of the above table It must be clearly understood that we are dealing with statistics for four consecutive months The Government returns do not state whether the population of each monthly return consists in part of the population of the preceding month and in part of newcomers though this may be assumed to be the case We have added together the stated populations in each monthly return to obtain the average ratio of deaths to population Thus in Table III it will be noted that the ratio of deaths in the Orange River Colony camps among men was i in 160 in June i in 107 in July 1 in 194 in August and 1 in 142 in September  while the average was 1 in 144 These ratios have been given in preference to the annual deathrate per 1000 as they represent a statement of actual facts and not an inference based on the assumption that the same experience would continue during twelve months The calamitous experience did however continue and became progressively worse during four months  and it is therefore justifiable now to proceed on the assumption that it might go on for several months longer if not for an entire yearand to contrast the above experience with the experience of England and Wales for an entire year Later on we shall attempt comparison with special communities smitten with measles An initial difficulty arises in contrasting the experience of the camps with that for England and Wales The three groups in the returns are men  women and children no clue being given as to the definition of child or the pro portion of infants of children aged 1 to 5 and of children over 5 though these data are essential in order to arrive at satisfactory statistics In the absence of these data we must have recourse to certain assumptions We will assume that all the children were under 5 years of age Probably a very considerable proportion were children aged 5 to 15 years Inasmuch as the normal deathrate at ages under 5 in England is 14 times as high as at ages 5 to 10 and 25 times as high as at ages 10 to 15 this assumption probably shows the experience of the camps in a too favourable light Annual Deathrate Per 1000 One Death to a Children Inhabitants In the Transvaal Orange River and Natal Camps based on four months experience  In England and Wales based on the experi ence of 1899 for children under 5  322 6 1 in 31 1 in 180 When dealing with the deathrates among men and women in the camps a similar though not so great a difficulty arises The deathrate per 1000 among persons in England and Wales ranges from 34 at ages 1520 to 332 at ages 5565 and 652 at ages 6575 Without attempting any exact com parison it is clear that among men the conditions of health varied greatly the deaths varying from i in 321 in the Natal camps to 1 in 213 in the Transvaal camps and 1 in 144 in the Orange River camps Women who normally have a much lower deathrate than men suffered exoessively the proportion of deaths varying in the camps of excessive mortality from 1 in 190 in the Natal and 1 in 156 in the Transvaal camps to 1 in 128 in the Orange River camps Amongst the 313 women in the Cape Colony camps only one died Fatality of Measles The question arises whether the epidemic of measles fur nishes a sufficient explanation for the calamitous deathrate shown above Exact statistics as to the severity case fatality of measles are somewhat scanty We append the following from two reports by Dr T Thomson issued by the Local Government Board dealing with urban districts in which cases of measles were compulsorily notifiable Fatality of Measles per 100 Attached at each Age Ages All ages A Unnamed District B BurtononTrent oI 12 23 34 45 510 96  40 197  50 102 1 58 49  03  15  03 11 i 01 Assuming that notification was equally complete in the two above districts it is clear that the fatality of measles varies greatly in different epidemics There is the strongest reason for believing that measles like some other zymotic diseases undergoes changes in virulence due to unknown conditions If we assume this to have been the case in the present epi demic would it reasonably account for the deaths of children in a proportion which if continued for a year would have killed 1 out of every 31  In District A above the highest fatality was during the second year of life when approxi mately 1 out of every 5 attacked succumbed but it is un reasonable to suppose that all the Boer children were of this age and it must be inferred that unless the measles in the camps displayed a virulence hitherto almost unknown other factors must have been at work Historical Epidemics of Measles Certain historical epidemics described by Hirsch1 throw light on the problem The most often quoted is the Fiji epi demic of 1874 which carried off from one fourth to onefifth of the whole population of the Fiji group It would be interest ing to discuss how far the virulence of this epidemic was caused by the fact that the Fijians among whom this was a new disease afforded a new and virgin soil for its virulent development and how far the lack of proper treatment and the exposure of patients to the most unfavourable conditions of food and housing were responsible for the result Possibly both sets of factors were at work We have no facts bearing on the question whether among the Boers who have been brought into these concentration camps measles had pre viously prevailed It is quite possible that in their scattered homesteads measles may have long been absent and that the camps thus furnished a most combustible material when the spark of infection was introduced It does not seem however that absence of previous measles can account completely for the high fatality of the present epidemic For analogous conditions we must look rather to the experience of the Confederate troops during the American Civil war and in Paris during the siege of 1871 than to Fiji Among the Confederate troops in 1866 measles caused 1900 deaths out of 38000 cases of sickness or a fatality of 20 per cent In Paris out of 215 of the Garde Mobile who took measles 86 or 40 percent died Clearly therefore under certain conditions among which are overcrowding defective sanitation and the influence of unsuitable and possibly scanty 1 Geographical Pathology vol i p 167 1420 mSSSaJ CONTRACT MEDICAL PRACTICENov 9 1901 food and depressing mental conditions measles sometimes assumes a virulence which is phenomenal Causes What are the causes which are likely to have been productive of the present excessive mortality in the concentration camps  i Almost certainly measles and complicating pneumonia are not entirely the cause When the story is completely told it will most probably be found that diarrhoea and enteric fever have also been prevalent 2 Some importance must be attached to the fact that a large proportion of the Boer children have probably never been previously exposed to measles and have now been exposed under conditions which ensure concentration of the poison of this disease The conditions are analogous to those of a work house into the babies ward of which measles is accidentally introduced Those who have experienced how fatal measles is under such circumstances will have little difficulty in partially realising the state of matters in the Boer camps 3 The Boers are stated to be dirty in their personal habits and difficult to control in regard to the elementary rules of sanitation necessary to maintain a large camp in a wholesome condition Probably this is true It is one of the strongest reasons for not permitting dense aggregations of people pos sessed of habits which are only safe in detached and lonely houses 4 Possibly unsuitable food and deficient clothing although every effort has doubtless been made to remedy these defects greatly aided in producing the result 5 In view of the excessive mortality from enteric fever among our own troops to which we have repeatedly drawn attention we are bound to suspect that the same unreadiness to make provision for probable contingencies has characterised the action of the responsible Army authorities in this as in other health matters The sanitary control of the large camps whether for soldiers or for Boers has been most unsatisfactory One of the most important recommendations of the recent South African Hospitals Commission was as to the necessity for appointing special sanitary officers whose duty it would be to organise and control the sanitary arrange ments of all large camps The sanitary as distinguished from the medical organisation of the South African Army has been attended by calamities for which the War Office must be held responsible Remedies What remedies are practicable  1 The immediate organisation of sanitary control of the camps on a scale sufficient to meet all requirements 2 Splitting up of the camps into a much larger number f units each having a separate organisation  visits from camp to camp being strictly prohibited The experience of the childrens hospitals in Paris gives abundant testimony to the dangers of accumulating a large number of measles patients These are graphically described by Dr Grancher2who quoted Dr Archambault as saying   Our patients die of the disease which they catch not of the disease for which they are ad mitted This is particular true of measles Uncomplicated measles needs to be treated in a separate building from measles associated with bronchopneumonia  and if disinfec tion is not required for measles it is desirable for its complications By antiseptic and aseptic methods the results of treatment of measles in the Paris hospitals for children have become much more favourable Such methods may not be practicable under the conditions of camp life The alternative is that no considerable number of sus ceptible children must be grouped together The camps must be split up and to some extent scattered This point is clearly brought out by Sir Walter Foster in a letter to the Times and he also lays stress on the importance of placing the camps on nonpolluted soils His words which represent the minimum requirements of the case may Joe quoted in conclusion  There are two plans for diminishing the evil which I think should be tried at once if they have not already been adopted namely1 The larger camps should be broken up into separated small camps so as to make the number of persons smaller on each area and 2 the sites on which the camps are placed should be regularly changed as fouled soil is a prolific cause of disease and a potent factor in increasing its virulence  2 Un Service

most readers will agree that Dr Larkings paper on Contract Practice is one of the most valuable contributions that have been made on this difficult subject Neither is Dr Larking in my opinion too optimis tic the solution of the question is in our own hands and the time is most opportune for action There is however just one statement which ought not to pass unmodified It is essential that we should all join heartily in the enterprise therefore it will be well to confess that practically we all are or have been miserable sinners Dr Larking says   The sinners are the younger members of the profession who like myself are led into these practices by an interested public Now it is notorious that in some districts a very large amount of unremunerative contract practice is done by senior members of oldestablished firmsmen who often hold high positions in our Associationby means of junior partners or assistants I point this out in no spirit of recrimination but to further the movement Dr Larking so well advocates Dr Larkings assertion makes it appear that the duty of begin ning rests entirely with the u younger members because they alone sin This is not so on the contrary the junior sinners may well look to their elders for an example Pro fessional and financial considerations make such a step much easier on the part of the oldestablished members I believe in most places the younger men would be only too glad to follow a good lead Warning to Young Practitioners SirI read with much interest in the British Medical Journal of October 19th your very excellent advice to a young practitioner and only trust that no one will sell his services at such a low price to any body of working men who preach the doctrine of unionism when their own interests are threatened Surely at the present day when we hear of a decreasing number of entries into the profession and a marked increase in the time required for study necessary to obtain a degree or diploma not mentioning the expenses to parents or guardians would it not be well for all young registered practitioners and others who are seeking districts to settle in not to accept any appointments under Colliery Friendly Society or Medi cal Aid Clubs without first making searching inquiries as to terms and the reason why their previous medical officer re signed or ceased to act for them  Many practitioners who accept such appointments for perhaps what looks like a tempting offer find out before long that they are slaves to a committee who only study their own interests and further that they are without friends among their professional brethren owing to an omission which might have been easily avoided by a little forethought Let us stand together and be loyal to each other upholding the traditions handed down to us which is the only way to gain public confidence I am glad to notice that in many districts doctors are waking up to the importance of combining which is a sure means of protecting themselvesI am etc October 30th A General Practitioner The Royal Free Hospital has received from Mr George Courtauldthe sum of 1000 to endow a bed in

laws of a similar kind in this country It would be vain repetition to do more than mention facts so familiar and recent to all of us The latest Midwives Bill of 1899 is a case in point Based upon its immediate predecessor it had the advantage of the General Medical Councils recommendations  it provided that no woman shall call herself or habitually practise for gain as a midwife unless she has obtained a licence  that in order to be licensed she must produce evidence of having undergone a proper training and subsequent examination or at the time of passing the Bill been in bonMe practice as a midwife The Bill did not render it illegal for any person to render assistance to a lyingin woman in an emergency Many thorny details were associated with this Bill  it bristled with difficulties which it is unnecessary now to recall or to recapitu late Amendments were proposed by the General Medical Council the British Medical Association by numerous Branches Societies and individuals It was altered in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons it was pricked mutilated distorted until at length it became almost unrecognisable from its original form  finally it came to an ignoble end being talked out in the House done to death by its own promoters and wellintentioned friends I have shown that midwives have existed since the begin ning of the world  that they will continue as long as the human race lasts is equally oertain Alter their names if you wish or can  call them midwifery nurses or any other appellation you can suggest license them register

the East York and North Lincoln Branch of the British Medical Association By C H MILBURN MB MS President of the Branch  Surgeon to the Victoria Hospital Hull My iirst duty is to express to you my sense of the honour you have conferred on me by electing me to the important posi tion of President of this Branch I can assure you that I ap preciate the compliment highly and I trust as the first Pre sident in the new century that I shall with your assistance and support be able to hand on the office to my successor with no tarnish on the lustre with which I receive it from my im mediate predecessors In the annual presidential addresses with which your souls are vexed but to which you listen with a patience and courtesy worthy of a better cause it is usually tue fashion to review either the whole or by less ambitious men some special division of the science of medicine and to point out the progress made and the lessons taught during and by that rogress I do not wish in this case to be outside the ashion and therefore as a subject which during the last eighteen months has occupied our thoughts more or less 1 have chosen as the basis of a short address The Military Sur gery of the Time of Ambroise Par and that of the Present Time I wish therefore today briefly to emphasise the fact of progress in medicine because we sometimes fail to recognise that we live in a time when knowledge is far advanced beyond that of even a few years ago  and because we have all that advanced knowledge we are disposed to pity those who had the misfortune to live in thosepast years  and all the more if they lived centuries ago We think they knew nothing and their work is therefore only worthy of our contempt  or at any rate they can have our sympathy for their ignorance We give them no credit for the work which has made our progress possible And yet if we read old treatises or books on such subjects as those in which progress is possibleand in this case on surgerywe often find that practices were in vogue then which we think are new and known only to a favoured few of us  that theories were invented and squabbled over to account for results the causes of which are unsettled even to this day  that reasons were given then to explain facts which are not yet explained and which are theorised over as dogmatically now as then For instance we find that observations were made of facts in con nection with wounds which were explained on certain theories then but which we explain in an entirely different way now and just as much to our satisfaction Who can say that  we have reached finality and that someone years hence may not be able to explain facts in a different way and also to hi complete ana finite satisfaction On this point Sir W Mac Cormac at the dinner when he received the Honorary Freedom of the Barbers Company on March 26th said  It is interesting to note that Par when he was 65 years old dedicated in 157s his great work on surgery to the King and he there tells us that he had laboured forty years to bring his art to perfection and striven so hard to attain his end that the ancients have nought wherein to exce us and posterity will not be able to surpass us It is extraordinary that this boast of attained perfection made more I than 300 years ago remained largely true until the latter half of the nineteentn century witnessed the transformation of surgery This boast of perfection has been made with curious frequency by surgeons The celebrated French surgeon Baron Boyer who was also at one time a barbersurgeon says in the preface to his great work on surgery in 1814 1 that surgery had made the greatest progress and had arrived at the highest degree of perfection of which it was susceptible Sir John Erichsen and others have in their time said much the same thing Some years ago an English translation of this book by Ambroise Par came into my possession and in a desultory way I have occasionally looked through it and been amused at his phraseology and the quaintness of his illustrations or effigies as he calls them Being interested in military surgery I have read his chapters on gunshot wounds and found much that was suggestive Though his pathology is of course obsolete his histories of his cases are good  and L have thought it might be useful to briefly recite some of them with their treatment and then see what advance we can claim in the treatment of battle wounds as shown by a few reports of some of the cases so far recorded from the Boer war Before doing so it might however be worth while going over very shortly a few facts in connection with Ambroise Fares life By so doing we shall be better able to judge of the opportunities which he had to practise military surgery and so get our foundation on which to build the superstructure which shows the claims he had to be called the  Father of  Modern Surgery  and incidentally to learn on what is the best authority how military surgery was carried on in the sixteenth century Quoting from an article in the Medical Review of April this year I find that Ambroise Par was at one time a barbers apprentice who arrived in Paris in 1532 and set about being initiated into the mysteries of shaving hairdreesing and poulticing Becoming a master of his trade in 1536 he opened shop under the barbersurgeons sign of the three basins In the intervals of his trade he probably studied at the hospitals and during the wars of Francis I he gained that knowledge of wounds and fractures which renders him the Father of Modern Surgery nevertheless it was as a barber that he started life As such he was illiteratethat is without Latinityand we find him deploring in the dedica tion of one of his books that it hath not pleased God so much grace to grant me that in youth I should have been based in Greek and Latin It was only by  a discreet process of dissimulation and a grave infraction of rules that Par received his cap and degree from the French College of Surgeons of that day He was attached to the persons of successive kings and was one of the few intimates of Charles IX whom that monarch was able to save from the horrors of the St Bartholomew Massacre Charles IXs successor Henry III so valued Par that through him the whole body of surgeons came into favour Jwb 22 1901JMILITARY SURGERY IN PARES DAYuSZSSLu 533 Francis I had created a Faculty of Surgery in 1544 with privi 1 leges not inferior to those of the University of Paris His 1 decree was renewed by Henry III who further gave the sur i geons permission to open a course of public lectures This  will give some idea of the important part Par played in the 1 development of the recognition of the value of the surgeonB art  It also shows that during the troublous and warring times of 1 Francis I Henry II Francis II and Charles IX he would 1 have such opportunities as fall to the lot of few surgeons of  seeing and treating wounds received in war  As an example of the surgical treatment of those days I quote the following case from Pars book   Whilst I was a surgeon to the Marshal of Montejan at Turin a certain common souldier received a wound on his wrist with a musk et ball by which the bones and tendons being much broken and the nervous bodies cruelly torn there followed agangrene and at length a mortification vcn to the elbow  besides also an inflammation seized upon the middle part of his chest and there was  a certain disposition to a gan grene  whereby it followed that he was painfuUy and dangerously troubled with helchings liicketings watchings un quietness and frequent swoundings which occasioned many chirurgeons to leave him as desperate But it so fell out that I overcome by his friends entreaty undertook the cure of this wretched person destitute of all humane help Wherefore knowing the mortification by its signs I cut off the arm by the elbow as speedily as I could making flrst the liga ture  I say I took it off not with a saw but oncly with an incisionknile cutting in sunder the ligaments which held the bones together because the sphacel was not passed the joint of the elbow Neither ought this section to be counted strange which is made in a joint  for Hippocrates I anuch commends it and saith that it is easily healed and that there is I nothing to be feared therein besides swounding by reason of the pain I caused by cutting the common tendons and ligaments But such in I cisin being made the former ligature could not hinder but much blond I must flow from thence by reason of the large vessels that run that way I wherefore I let the bloud to flow plentifully so to disburden the pat I and so afterwards to free it from the danger of inflammation and a gan I grene  then presently I stanched the bloud with an hot iron for as yet I I knew no other course Then gentlv losing the ligature I scarified that I part of the brawn of the arm whioh was gangrcnated with many and I deep incisions shunning and not touching the inner part by the reason oE the multitude of the large vessels and nerves that run that way  then I presently applied a cautery to some of the incisions both to stanch the bleeding and draw forth the virulent  sanies which remained iif the part And then I assailed the spreading putrefaction by applying the formerly prescribed medicins  I used all sorts of restrictive meaicius to stay the inflammation of the chest I also applied epithimaes to the heart and gave him cordial potions and boles neither did I desist from vising them until such time as his helchings liicketings and swoundings had left him Whilst I more attentively intended these things another mischief assails my patient to wit convulsions and that not through any fault of him or me but through the naughtiness of the place wherein he lay which was in a barn everywhere full of chinks and open vHi every side  and then also it was in the midst of winter raging with frost and snow and all sorts of cold  neither had he any fire or anything necessary for preservation of life to lessen these injuries of the air and place Now his joints were contracted his teeth set and his mouth and face were drawn awry when I pitying his case made him to be carried into the neighbouring stable which smoaked with much ihorsedung and bringing in fire in two chafing dishes I presently anointed his neck and ail the spine of his back shunning the parts of the sliest with liniments formerly described for convulsions  then straight I way I wrapped him in a warm linncn cloth and buried him even to the I neck in hot dung putting a little fresh straw about him When he had stayed there some three days having at length a gentle scouring or flux I of his belly and plentiful sweat he oegan by little and little to open his I mouth and teeth which before were set and close shut Having got by this means some opportunity better to do my business I opened his mouth as much I pleased by putting this instrument between his teeth Now drawing out the instrument I Kept his mouth open by putting in a willowstick on each side thereof that so I might the more easily feed him with meats soon made as with cows milk and rear eggs until he had recovered power to eat the convulsions having left him He by this means freed from the convulsion I then again began the cure of his arm and with an actual cautery seared the end of the bone so as to dry up the perpetual afflux of corrupt matter It is not altogether unworthy of your knowledge that he said how that he was wondrously delighted by the application of such actual cauteries a certain tickling running the whole length of the arm by reason of the gentle diffusion of the heat by the ap plying the caustic  which same thing I have observed in others especially in such as lay upon the like occasion in the hospital of Paris After this cauterising ther fell away many and large scales of the bonebesides when there was place for fomentation with the decoction of red rose leaves wormwood sage bayleaves flowers of camomil and dill I so com forted the part that I also at the same time by the same means drew and took away the virulent  sanies which firmly adhered to the flesh and bones Lastly it came to pass that by Gods assistance these means I used and my careful diligence he at length recovered Wherefore I would admonish the young chirurgeon that he never account any so desperate as to give him for lost content to let him go with prognosticks  for as an ancient doctor writesthat as in Nature so in diseases there are also monsters Translating this rather long case into our modern termin ology we find that this man had a compound comminuted fracture of the wrist  that he developed gangrene and I take it by the description of the convulsion that he also had tetanus Yet with all these complications and in spite of treatment he recovered I say in spite of treatment7 ft idvisedly for apart from the gangrene knowing as we do hat tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacillus whose habitat s earth we wonder how he did get better seeing how com pletely this  common souldier as he is called is placed inder the most unfavourable conditions possible for recovery ble undergoes amputation at the elbowjoint no doubt oughly performed and without an anaesthetic  he is bled reely  he is laid in a barn  full of chinks in the midst of vinter with no comfort  and to crown all buried to the neck tor three days in  fertiliser7 But he recovers One feels Lhat he himself deserves the credit of this rather than the surgeons skill What would be the present day treatment of such a case Y A soldier so shot through the wrist would be promptly or within a very short time picked up by the stretcherbearers a tourniquet or the first field dressing having probably in the meantime been applied He would then be taken to the eld hospital and further examined If there was much mashing of bones in due course he would be anaesthetised Loose fragments removed the wound thoroughly cleansed cut tendons sutured and an antiseptic dressing and splint put on lie might then be slowly passed down to the base and there carefully nursed back to healthwith in every probability the limb saved and serviceable If through any mischance tetanus supervened tetanus antitoxin would be injected and a disease overcome which has hitherto been dreaded by both surgeon and patient Looking both at the means and the results I think you will agree with me that surgery has a great deal to be proud of and the soldier a great deal to be thankful for in the progress shown between the two ex tremes of which these cases are types As a matter of fact I believe there has been a remarkable freedom from tetanus during the Boer war  at any rate I have not come across re cords of many cases Apart from the question of tetanus however the vast majority of cases of bullet injury seem to have run a most un eventful course Many reasons have been advanced for this pleasing result Mr Smith the civil surgeon in charge of the Surgical Division of No 9 General Hospital in an article in the British Medical Journal of April 20th suggests the following  1 The sterility of the bullet owing to the heat engendered by its great rotatory velocity 2 The purity of the atmosphere 3 The hardened fit condition of the men 4 The absence of serious oozing 5 The absence of air or foreign bodies in the track 6 The sun and the dry atmosphere which glaze and seal up the small wound before it has had time to become con taminated To these I think should be added  7 Promptness of dressing this resulting from the fact that each man carries attached to his uniform a  first field dressing which has been applied at once either by the wounded soldier himself or by a comrade as witness the large number of VCs awarded for such aid under fire 8 The greater gentleness of handling and transport of in jured men owing to the greater extension of training of soldiers in  first aid Increase of the damage is thus pre vented as there is not as in the past rough and unintelli gent though wellmeaning assistance given 9 And in my opinion as the greatest of all is the in creased science knowledge and skill exhibited ly the sur geons of the Royal Army Medical Corps and their civil colleagues They are not the men themselves to call public attention to their work either in this r previous wars so that I think it behoves those who have watched and followed their work to call public attention to it and as the Government and the public do not give them the rewards and the credit to which they are entitled I hope it will be some solatium for them to know that their fellow civil practi tioners consider that their conduct and work has been such as well merits the commendation of  Well done thou good and faithful servant Our eulogies of the RAMC cannot be too great nor our support and assistance to them too thorough in their fight against War Office starvation of the medical service and red tapeism Has any other unit of the South Africa Field Force I except

civil ambulance organisa tions to make up the wastage which occurs even in peace let alone in war Neither the artillery the cavalry or the in fantry was expected to do war work with its peace establish ment Yet the RAMC was  and astonishment was shown and abuBe scattered when it was proved to be a physical im possibility Worse still it was expected to do that work with really less than peace strength for it has been well known that even before the war broke out the numbers of the RAMC were far below those authorised even if that strength were sufficient for ordinary times Why was that  Because the service was and is most unpopular and will be come more so unless radical alterations are made by the War Office as regards fair and equal treatment pay privi leges etc And unless the authorities are quick to recognise this they will soon have no RAMC left  for men already in leave it as soon as they can and there are none to take their places I feel that it behoves us to recognise the injustices done to our military brethren and to appeal to all to do what in them lies to bring about justice for that is all that is asked for the RAMC Returning now to the consideration of bullet wounds we find that in the classifying of gunshot wounds Par says that they are usually round on account of the bullets being round As a result of this he says   All wounds which are made in mans body by gunshot whether simple or com pound are accompanied by contusion dilaceration dis temper and swelling  and up to the introduction of elon gated projectiles that was undoubtedly true and the injuries produced were correspondingly severe With the exception of shrapnel which are scattered on the explosion of a shell all bullets are now elongated The reason is that they are better able to take the grooving of the rifle which makes them rotate on the axis of the line of flight We thus get a flatter trajectory and therefore greater accuracy Another effect is muchincreased velocity and a longer range because more powerful explosives or propellants can be used and with the bullet fitting the rifle bore closely there is no waste of power behind Paradoxical as it may seem with all this greater accuracy and power there is now much less damage done than in the old days of the round bullet for the elon gated one by its high velocity and rotatory motion bores its way between planes of muscles bones blood vessels and nerves pushingthem to one side rather than smashing its way through There have been many cases reported in which this must have happened but I think the following is as typical as any I have read In A Subalterns Letters to his Wife he describes how Arnold a Vorkshireman belonging to Rimingtons Guides got a bullet through his head and yet rode fifteen miles into Bloemfontein without falling off his horse The bullet entered close to the orifice of one ear and came out through the lobe of the other Arnold smoked his pipe in hospital that same evening and next day he got out of bed to go back to his corps but was forcibly prevented by the nurse The following morn ing however he was discharged cured In this case I have no doubt the bullet had made its way amongst the muscles in front of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae also practically threading its way through the large vessels and nerves of the neck and just missing the mastoid processes The following is another interesting case de scribed by Mr Smith in the article which I mentioned before  Private McK of the Inniskilling Fusiliers wounded at Colenso February 34th The bullet had passed obliquely through the lower part of the neck and the upper part of the thorax with entry at the centre of the left sternomastoid and exit in the right posterior axillary fold j inch external to the angle of the scapula It is difficult to imagine how the great vessels escaped The chief injury was to the left brachial plexus For some time he had complete motor and sensory paralysis of the arm Subsequently sensation returned and when I saw him though themuscles were weak and atrophied some motor power had returned to all except the group supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve Even in this case there cannot have been much more damage done than bruising and contusing or there could not have been the satisfactory result of the recovery of power and sensation that ensued Regarding the wound of entrance the area of the point of impact is much less than with a  For instance the St John Ambulance Brigade provided 1934 noncom missioned oflicers and men orderlies for South Africa and 5 for China in 40 contingents as required The War Oflcc acknowledgement is as usual when things medical are affected that is wanting round ballet and so the point of entry is naturally much less On the other hand the wound of exit is often crater like in its extent This may be because even in the short time that elapses between entrance and exit a reflex contrac tion in rear of the bullet concentrates the expansive and radiating force in the direction of the line of flight and so makes it focus the energy on the surfaces internal to the skin and on the skin itself finally bursting its way out and not infrequently carrying with it fragments of bone etc Another reason is that the bullet in its passage through the tissues may have its point knocked up or flattened or otherwise made irregular if it comes in oontact with a hard bone This is however not so common now unless the point of the bullet has its nickel casing filed or cut off so as to expose the lead or unless the bullet is of the softnosed or expanding variety which makes it practically the same as regards result I regret that there is abundant evidence that these bullets have been used Only a vengeful nature can justify the use of such for they maim and disable with much more unnecessary cruelty than is produced by the hard pointed pencil bullet which equally well places a man horn de combat but does it in a  gentlemanly way and with not a tithe of the suffering nor with such an amount of permanent disablement The question of bullets which have been wilfully poisoned before being fired is an interesting one and one not brought up for the first time during the Boer war In describing  wounds made by gunshot Par says  Now to come to those who think that the venenate quality of wound made by gunshot springs not from the powder but from the bullet wherewith some poyson had been commixt or joyned or which hath been tempered or steeped in some poysonous liquor This may suf ficiently serve for a reply that the fire is abundantly powerful to dis sipate all the strength ot the poyson if any should be poured upon or added to the bullet This much confirma my opinion which everyone knows the bullets which the Kings souldiers used to shoot against the townsmen in the siege of Kouen were free from all poyson yet for all that they of the town thought they were all poysoned when they found the wounds made by them to be uncurable and deadly Now on the other side the townsmen were falsely suspected guilty of the same crime by the Kings army when as they perceived the Chirurgeons labour in curing wounds made by the bullets shot from Rouen to be frustrated by their contumacy and malign nature  each side judging of the magnitude and malignity of the cause from the unhappy success of the effect in curing Even as among physicians according to Hippocrates all diseases are called pestilent wftich arising from whatsoever common I cause kill many people  so also wounds made by gunshot may in some I respect be called pestilent for that they are more refractory and difficult I to cure than others and not because they partake of any poysonous I quality but by default of some common cause as the ill complections of I the patients the infection of the air and the corruptions of the meats I and drinks I venture to think that Par in speaking of infections and corruptions had anticipated our theories of sepsis of the present day though not quite on our lines And further you note how history repeated itself in that each side has charged the other with using poisoned bullets though I must confess that I have not come across any definite evidence proving it against the Boers and we do not have occasion to do such things in the British army even if we desired The probability is 1 think that many of the Mauser bullets have been in stock some time that they have been coated with some oily or fatty substance as a lubricant  that in the course of time this coating has become decomposed or turned rancid and the acid formed combining with the copper of the cartridge casing which is attached to the bullet has formed a copper salt and so produced the green or other coating which has been observed in certain bando liers or captured stores of ammunition I venture to submit this as the most likely reason for the unusual appearance of the bullets and which has originated the report that they were poisoned Passing to another division of military surgery I come across in Par records of the treatment and cure of pene trating wounds of the trunk cavities or of the hollow viscera And these therefore we can note as landmarks showing the great advance that has been made between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries  though I am not far wrong I think if I ptate that as much real progress has been made in the last fifty years as in the whole of the preceding three hundred and fifty For instance he describes the case of Captain Francis dAlon a native of Xantoign who before Rochel was shot with a musket

MILITARY MEDICAL SERVICE The Council of the British Medical Association at its last meeting adopted a report on the Military Medical Services which had been sent up by the Parliamentary Bills Conv mittee The report which is published as a special supplement to this issue of the Journal was drafted by a Subcommittee of experts upon which the medical officers of the auxiliary forces were represented and which was presided over by SurgeonGeneral Hamilton The suggestions contained in the report are therefore of a thoroughly practical character and will we trust receive the sympathetic consideration of the Secretary of State for War The substance of the report falls under two headsthe medical services of the regular and auxiliary forces but also touches on the Indian Medical Service which cannot of course be left out of account in any considera tion of the needs of military service of the Empire The regular service is dealt with both generally and specifically and fairly exhaustively Although the general causes which make it unpopular and keep it undermanned were well known at least to experts the subcommittee wisely determined as a preliminary to the consideration of the subject to ascertain the views of the medical colleges aod schools throughout the kingdom A large number of replies were received and as will be seen from the analyses of answers given in the report there is prac tical unanimity on one point namely that undermanning lies at the root of the drawbacks and consequent unpopu larity of the service From this one cause there result a host of evils such as overwork of individuals harassing changes of stations and duties undue prolongation of terms of foreign service in sufficient ordinary leave and no possibility of leave for the improvement of professional knowledge Insufficient pay in junior ranks is indicated as one of the chief causes of this undermanning It appears that the pay cannot be made to cover unavoidable expenses and it is therefore faeld that an increase in pay must precede any successful tilling up of establishments This difficulty has been ren dered acute by the fact that the army has now to compete with the increased emoluments which assistants have in recent years been able to command in civil life Notwithstanding successive augmentations of the army during past decades with consequent increase of duties atj home and abroad the medical service is at present about 200 under what it was forty years ago Furthi ithas now  to provide for the militia as the 300 militia surgeons of that period have all but died out Taking the two branches together there are now actually 500 fewer medical officers than in the early Sixties The processes of the official mind are often inscrutable and it is therefore difficult to determine the reason that has led to these two services being allowed to fall into so lamentable a condition unless it be mistaken trust in a socalled  Reserve formed about thirteen years ago by the simple procedure of counting the medical officers of the auxiliary forces two or three times over in separate lists The fallacy in the constitution of such a reserve was pointed out at the time of its formation and since then the atten tion of successive War Ministers has been drawn to the matter The Committee points to the fact that this Medical Reserve was not called up during the Boer war as proof that the authorities did not regard it as a reserve in the true sense of the word If by  national emergency  in vasion only is meant it would be of even less value as then the officers would have to join their respective corps on mobilisation The cogency of this reasoning cannot be gainsaid but we could have wished that the Committee had seen its way to suggest some definite scheme for a genuine reserve It must be admitted that the task of forming a reserve of civil practitioners tied down by private and personal responsibilities which perhaps exceed those of any other class in the community is very difficult Among the conditions which are mentioned as operating to deter young men from entering the Army Medical Service the character of the present entrance examination is mentioned It was instituted at a time when the diplomas of the licensing bodies in the United Kingdom were granted after a curriculum and examination very different from those now required It must be remem bered that for years past competition for commissions in the Army Medical Service has practically ceased owing to the fact that the number of candidates has not as a rule equalled the number of vacancies The report recom mends that in place of competition which has become inoperative candidates for the Royal Army Medical Corps should be recommended by the various constituted authorities of the profession the universities colleges and schools It is believed that in this wav the class of men best suited for the army would be obtained As an aid to the successful application of this principle the forma tion of medical cadet corps at the various medical schools is suggested It would be useless to attempt to forecast how this sug gestion of the abolition of open competition will be re ceived by the authorities Competition is assuredly no longer the popular fetish it was thirty years ago though there is still much to be said in its favour It is the fact however that in the army medical service it has practically ceased to exist and the situation thus created has to be dealt with It is clear that competition and nomination cannot be carried on as they now are side by side One of them must go  and as the former has already in practice ceased there seems to be no alternative but nomination The true army status of medical officers still seems doubt ful in the schools notwithstanding the granting of military titles in a Royal Corps this is doubtless due at least in part to i9 MwSS THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONSUMPTIVEMay 4 9V distrust of the military authorities from whom these conces sions Were wrung virtually by force and who still try to mini mise them in various ways What is not at all doubtful however is that should any illadvised meddling with the rank and titles of army medical officers now be attempted under the name of reform the result will be an abject failure that will cover the responsible Minister with shame as with a garment and lead to a state of things that will entail heavy cost to the overburdened taxpayer and too pro bably also inuch preventable suffering on our troops The report contains some valuable suggestions as to reorganisation of the headquarter and district medical staffs The pay and position of such a highplaced officer as that of DirectorGeneral are inadequate while his staff has been cut down much below the strength fixed for years under the recommendation of the Sidney Herbert Commis sion of 1858 The addendum dealing with the Indian Medical Service recoinmends its amalgamation with the home service in so far as military duties in India are concerned  but the subject is much too wide to be now discussed That part of the report which deals with the auxiliary forces contains in its first section the uncomprising state ment that  organisation in the sense of preparation for the medical requirements of a large force on taking the field can hardly be said to exist in any branch of the auxiliary service We venture to hope that this pro nouncement will receive the serious attention of the War Office for the tone of this part of the report shows that those best acquainted with the actualities and possibilities of the situation are much impressed by the many diffi culties which must attend any attempt to provide an efficient medical service for the great auxiliary army for home defence contemplated in the scheme of the Govern ment Provision has to be made for the Militta the Yeomanry and the Volunteers and the report is quite clear upon the point that the medical organisation for the auxiliary forces must be regimental as well as depart mental The organisation of the units of militia yeomanry and volunteers makes a unified medical service as in the regular army impossible though it does not preclude the maintenance and development of the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps On the contrary the report recommends that bearer companies and hospital companies sufficient for the whole volunteer force if mobilised into brigades divisions and army corps should be organised during peace for training and that the existing companies of the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps and the brigade bearer companies represent the nucleus of such an organisation It is further recommended that the medical services for the whole of the auxiliary forces should be organised on similar lines but kept as separate branches and made quite independent of the Royal Army Medical Corps Into the details of the scheme suggested in the report it would be premature to enter here They will at least form a basis for discussion and for further elaboration as the situation becomes clearer But we cannot refrain from drawing attention to the very different conceptions formed by the War Office and by the expert subcommittee of the British Medical Association as to the needs of the yeo manry The War Office considers that one medical officer will be sufficient for each regiment and does not appear tc contemplate any coordinating departmental organisation The report of the subcommittee of experts assigns two sur geons to each regiment and a supernumerary surgeon to relieve the strain on the two regimental officers during the annual training It recommends also a yeomanry medi cal staff corps of 250 medical officers with mounted brigade bearer companies properly equipped for service with cavalry We have before expressed the opinion that augmentation and reorganisation of the military medical services should not and cannot be long delayed It is most important how ever that nothing should be done hastily or without full consideration of the needs of the army and the peculiar exigencies of medical practice We believe that the sub ject would be best threshed out by a committee on which the War Office the military medical services the teachers in medical schools and the general body of the medical profession in the three kingdoms were fairly represented Mr Brodrick has as we have already pointed out plenty of theoretical advisers inside as well as outside the medical profession but we trust that he will listen with caution to theoretical reformers who are not in touch with and have no real knowledge of the services and who seem to imagine that the medical profession can be drawn upon at any time to any extent that may suit the requirements of the moment or the parsimony of Parliament Unless service is to be made compulsory this is simply a gratuitous assumption and any scheme of provision for the emer gencies of war or even for foreign service in time of peace based upon it must inevitably fall to pieces at the fipst impact of hard fact THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONSUMPTIVE The effect of bodily disease on the mind is a compara tively unexplored region of psychology We indeed believe in a general way that longcontinued severe pain may derange the reason  that cutaneous irritation may give rise to a kind of frenzy  that gout engenders an almost savage irascibility  that dyspepsia obfuscates the intellect and engenders spiritual gloom that a disordered liver breeds melancholy  that a loaded colon disables the judg ment  that fissure or fistula of the anus causes a peculiar irritability of temper These facts suggest that every organic lesion and indeed every pathological condition may reflect itself in a corresponding mental disturbance so as to supply a scientific basis for the charitable maxim  Tout comprendre cest tout pardonner An interesting contribution to this field of clinical research has been made by Dr Maurice Letulle who in a recent num ber of the Archives Gnrales de Mdecine gives the result of an investigation which he has lately carried out as to the psychology of phthisis In the early stage

surgeons with the forces in South Africa were entertained at dinner in the Exchange Station Hotel by the members of the profession in Liverpool The chair was occupied by Mr Edgar Browne President of the Medical In stitution and the vicechair by Sir William M Banks The guests were Mr J M Aldred Mr T T Bark Mr W B Bennett Dr R Craig Dun Mr A M Dodd Mr Arthur Evans Mr T H Moyles Mr J Owen Mr E Roberts Mr Arthur Walker and Mr J H Willett Amongst those present were Sir Edward Russell and there was a large and representative gathering of the members of the profession in the City and the neighbourhood After the customary loyal toasts had been honoured the Chairman proposed the health of the guests and said that owing to their having only civilian rank they had been allowed to return to this country without receiving any public acknow ledgment  but their professional brethren were of opinion that their success in the field merited as much recognition as though there were no such thing as red tape  that evening they were delighted to honour the patriotism and selfsacrifice which had cost one of themDr Edgar Smithhis life They at least would never forget what these gentlemen had done for their country and for their profession Dr Craig Dun who responded said that when he offered his services to the War Office he had an interview with an official of the Army Medical Department who showed him the names of between 800 and 900 other medical volunteers and told him that the War Office might perhaps accept the services of three or four Soon afterwards the order was issued to raise twelve regiments of Yeomanry He heard nothing further for six weeks and had dismissed the matter from his mind when he received a telegram one Friday night telling him he had been appointed medical officer to the 2nd Regiment of Yeomanry with the temporary rank of captain and that he must sail on the following Tuesday He went to London and saw the same official as to the medical equip ment of his regiment He was told that he must  requisition for it He did not then knor what a requisition meant The result was that in spite of every effort he had to sail with 1550 officers and men but without either a drug or a bandage Thanks to the better medical arrangements of the navy he found what was necessary for the voyage out on the transport At Capetown the difficulty as to getting medical equipment for the corp3 again cropped up He was told that tnough the regiment was ordered to the front there were no medical or surgical necessaries available for it However by dint of the exertion of influence he eventually got an equipment which to judge by the age of the drugs had been out in the Crimea It was plain that the War Office might have ap pointed the surgeons for the yeomanry regiments at the time the order to raise them was given so that the medical equip ment might have been obtained The fact that the regiment must go to the front without medical equipment did not seem to impress the official concerned at Capetown On arriving at De Aar he found a hospital staff and equipment for oigaty men Soon afterwards they had to deal with 245 patients nearly all too severely wounded to be sent down to Capetown Subsequently his corps went up the country with Lord Kitchener and were in action They had seventy casualties The dressings gave out in 48 hours and they had to tear up the sheets commandeered from Boer farm houses Three months afterwards he was back at De Aar and he found that the state of unpreparedness was precisely the same as before When he arrived at Bloemfontein the stress of work was over and the hospitals were doing fairly well At Kroonstad there were three hospitals one civil and two mili tary One civil and one military hospital were perfect In the second military hospitalin the churchthe men were lying on their mackintoshes covered only with blankets and without either sheets or pyjamas That could not be accounted for by the exigencies of war At Pretoria there was an excellent Irish civil hospital in the Law Courts As to the field hospitals they were splendidly equipped for the work they had to do according to the army regulations but not for dealing with enteric and dysentery patients as well as with wounded Besides the sick had to subsist on bullybeef and biscuit Were these things the fault of the system or of the men  He had no hesitation in saying they were wholly the fault of the system The Army Medical Corps had done splen did work under the greatest possible difficulties In the face of the existing regulations he could not honestly advise any graduate in medicine to look to service in the army as a fair field for his activity In concluding Dr Dun made one or two suggestions At present promotion in the Army Corps he paid depended not on professional ability but on a mans filling in his return sheets accurately The medical men at the front spent a great deal of their time filling up return sheets He would relegate this clerical work to noncommis sioned officers He also advocated a return to the old system of regimental doctors The annual report of the Royal Infirmary for the year 1900 shows a deficit of 2800 There is a constant tendency to increased expenditure the increased price of coal alone in volving an addition of 200 to the years outlay As the Treasurer observes in his report however if the institution is to keep pace with the constant advance in surgical and medical requirements such as in the interests of the com munity the Committee maintains to be the just function of a firotclass teaching hospital this cannot be otherwise The annual reports of the Medical Surgical and Pathological Registrars of the same institution have also been published constituting the fifth yearly issue The volume contains twelve pages more than the issue of last year These reports represent a vast amount of labour in analysing and tabulat ing cases and will doubtless be found of great value by clinical and pathological investigators The Committee of the Epileptic Home at Maghull in their twelfth annual report presented to the annual meeting held recently state that the general health of the patients apart from their special ailment has been very satisfactory Dur I ing the year 21 patients have been discharged and 3 have died and on December 31st there remained in the home 69 males and 54 females Land has been purchased for the purpose of erecting a villa for firstclass patients and to pro vide accommodation for the nursing staff of the male home The building roads and drainage are estimated to cost in all 5500 towards which the Committee have funds in hand or promised amounting to 3500 leaving an amount of 2000 still to be provided A friend has generously promised 500 towards the cost of furnishing the villa and another friend has intimated her willingness to furnish a suite of rooms An attempt is being made to secure a suitable farm on which patients can be employed for wages The medical report states that there are epileptics in the home who can plough hoe reap milk cows and perform household duties  in fact the homes are blocked by these trained cases who occupy the ground necessary for developing the faculties of the new patients Mr A L Jone in moving that the report and the treasurers statement be adopted said that he felt the greatest sympathy with the efforts of the Committee and that he believed they wanted

letter in the British Medical Journal of November 23rd Amongst all the anonymous criticism of the Army Medical reorganisation scheme that has appeared this letter with those of  An Officer of Long Indian Experience published on October 12th and of Dr Edward Thompson MP stands conspicuous as showing a sincere impersonal and dis criminating zeal for the welfare of the service With the other letters written for the most part by officers on the active list who naturally fear radical changes that may affect their whole future prospects one has also the greatest sympathy  and it is in the hope of easing to some extent the minds of their writers that I venture in an independent capacity to take up a few of the points raised in the three letters which have more especially focussed the criticism of the scheme SurgeonGeneral Hamilton admitting that  this new scheme has good and liberal points lays chief stress on four features which he finds objectionable    The keeping at home of all the junior officers till they complete four years service This as he justly remarks would be fatal to the efficiency and credit of the scheme  but it is nowhere laid down and indeed was not even contem plated The Committee intended that lieutenants on leaving Aldershot should at once proceed to India and should there after three years service undergo the first examination for promotion b Theright to retire on 1 a day after twenty years service is taken away This would indeed be a grave in justice to officers of the corps and would produce the direst results But it was not intended by the Committee The mistake arises from a chance difference in the wording of the conditions which have always existed by which an unsatis factory officer may thus be retired without drawing further attention to his defects A major of my acquaintance in South Africa was thus retired after eighteen years service at an early period of the present war But it may be noted that even in the letter apart from the spirit of the scheme such a punishment is never to be in flicted on an officer unless he twice fails after three months studyleave to get a bare 40 per cent of marks in a simple examination on administrative subjects in which proficiency is as essential to the service as it must be natural to an RAMC officer with eighteen years experience  and even then only with the approval of the Advisory Board by whom the case will be considered entirely on its merits and on the further recommendation of the DirectorGeneral and the Secretary of State for War These are so many courts of appeal which will surely protect an officer from unjust treat ment Compulsory retirement at this stage will be as hitherto an active rather than a passive process c Examinations have their value but they are not everything that should be considered Quite so Examina tions test only the candidates knowledge the only thing that he can by his own initiative imnrove It is hoped in this scheme to secure a real practical and clinical  standard of examination to test knowledge of the right kind The examinations will enable men who do their best to keep abreast of the times to get some reward in return for their labours as hitherto they have never had and it will be agreed that no officer who is unable after six months special preparation to get an allround mark of 50 per cent is worthy of his commission On the other hand as SurgeonGeneral Hamilton puts it tact temper zeal and a host of other virtues are of far greater importance But as these cannot be tested by any exact comparative system the scheme provides 1 for brevet promotion and 2 for chargepay in command of hospitals appointment to which will be made by the DirectorGeneral doubtless with regard to fitness apart from examination d  The inspection of military hospitals by the Advisory Board will be unworkable and most unpopular I venture to 74

unlikely that it will depute proxies to inspect abroad from time to time These inspections it will be noticed are of an advisory and scientific not of a disciplinary character  for the DirectorGeneral is responsible for all discipline Section 18 Officers in charge will be only too glad of an opportunity of pointing out their needs The Inspecting Subcommittee will be the

threequarters of the corps e A further criticismthat the position of the Director General is underminednow falls to the ground with his new position as LieutenantGeneral on the Army Board By virtue of this position many minor points may secure atten tion as they arise  and by the help of the Advisory Board the corps will be in touch with the medical profession in general and will have its weighty support I think these are the chief objections that have been raised to the scheme It is admittedly only a framework on which the Advisory Board will start work But the Royal Warrant will undoubtedly be based on the spirit rather than the letter of the scheme  it will take into consideration the points that have been raised in this discussion  it will pin down the Indian Government to their share of the bargain  and as the objections have been mostly in keeping with the spirit of the Committeethat of justice progress and reformI feel con fident that there is a good prospect in store for the RAMC I am etc December 4th FRANCIS E FremANTLE SirI think you have hit the nail on the head when you state that  the most important function of the Army Medical Service not only in peace but in war is the prevention of disease among troops Your strictures re the constitution of the civilian part of the Advisory Board will  am sure be emphatically endorsed by the majority of civilian surgeons who have had the honour of serving their Queen or King and country in South Africa The dominating idea which prevailed at the beginning of the Britain v Boer war as regards the necessity of having a number of experts in abdominal surgery has been shown by experience to be based entirely upon theoretical grounds sound in civil life and not upon the actual conditions which exist after engagements In the vast majority of gunshot wounds that require lapar otomy after a battle the psychological moment for operating had passed before the arrival of the surgeon and the safety of the patient was best considered by adopting a con servative course It is to be hoped that the Advisory Board will be augmented by men who have special knowledge and strong determined views regarding the prevention of disease among troops I am one of those who believe that if Dr Canneys ideas about the water supply of the army could be carried out more lives would be saved than would be if the whole craft of lapar otomists and dermatologists were to follow in the wake of an advancing army I may perhaps be allowed to relate the experience of the Welsh Hospital staff as regards enteric fever The water for the use of the staff was boiled and filtered The orderlies did not take the trouble to draw water from the filters for their own use and five out of the seven we took up country with us were down with enteric within a month Not one of the qualified staff dressers and sisters who eschewed unboiled  water contracted enteric during the existence of the hospital Seven of the nursing sisters stayed out in South Africa after the hospital was handed over to the authorities and it is a significant fact that three of them afterwards contracted enteric fever I am not in a position to state whether their drinking water was conscientiously boiled Or not after we left There is no doubt in my mind that if eminent sanitary medical officers were appointed with welldefined executive powers an immense reduction in the mortality list would be the immediate result Prevention much more than the treatment of wounds or skin disease is the most urgent problem in every campaign but so far one cannot but feel that until the civilian element of the Advisory Board is radically altered their opinion with regard to this im portant matter will not command the confidence of the medi cal professionI am etc Cardiff Nov 27th J Lynn Thomas CB FRCS SirAs the accuracy of my statement placing the pay and advantages of a

allowed two soldier grooms to whom he pays about 1 a month each or say 24 a year Civilian grooms cost at least 1 is a week each which amounts to 104 guineas or 109 4s a year  deducting the 24 paid to the soldier grooms leaves a net balance of 85 4s to credit which added to 1400 13s g makes a total of 1485 17s g per annum The proposed pay of a surgeongeneral is 1500 a year from the whole of which income tax has to be deducted and this leaves the surgeongenerals 15 17s d a year to the bad  but as in the summer months there is a small reduction in thefuel and light allowance I showed the loss to be about ioa year for the new over the old rates As regards the rates of pay in India the following table gives the new rates of home pay converted into rupees at 1 s 4d 1 Home India

will draw less pay in that country than at heme Majors and junior lieutenantcolonels are fairly well paid but the 50 senior selected lieutenantcolonels of whom 17 are on the Indian Establishment

SirI beg to suggest that now is a most favourable oppor tunity for the London University and the Royal Colleges to formulate some scheme for the institution of a pass degree in I medicine for London students The situation is pressing I submit that most future medical students will demand at least a pass degree as a reward for their labours If this is not forthcoming they will not be

could offer the magnificent clinical opportunities and the enormous amount of pathological material that was so excellently managed in some of the London schools the older universities were still able to prepare their men to utilise to the full these opportunities They could instil into them the principles of pathology and train them in methods of observation and work perhaps even better than it could be done in the rush of the London schools where there was so much of clinical interest to the senior student indeed such a wealth of material that it might distract the junior student from the minute and careful study of the elements of his work Would it not be to the advantage of the under graduates that they should in university laboratories and in the smaller hospitals have a good foundation laid on which they might in larger hospitals build a solid and enduring superstructure  There could be no better place for the encouragement of the various branches of pathology than a university In Oxford they now had their workshop but they had something more they had the men to work in it men already trained in power of observation in scientific accuracy in logical methods of thought and in those broader philosophical systems which enabled a man to classify his facts and utilise them as material for scientific deduction in his study of pathology and medicine Thanks to such laboratories as the one in which they were assembled medicine was passing from the phase of empiric practice to the clearer region of scientific method Oxford had long had its teachers and its pupils  now she had a workshop in which these men might work and they might now expect even more and better pathological work from the Oxford School than in the preceding period during which they had been so active In concluding he ventured on behalf of the Cam bridge Medical School and also of those members of the Scottish Universities present to offer to Oxford their hearty congratulations on what had already been achieved by her great medical teachers and their best wishes for the exten sion and development of her active school of pathology The Regius Professor op Medicine Sir J Burdon Sanderson in moving a vote of thanks to the ViceChancellor for presiding said it was a happy augury that the Vice Chancellor was a lineal descendant of that Dr Monro to whose teaching the founding of the great medical school of Edinburgh in the middle of the eighteenth century was largely due The Master of Lincoln College seconded the motion and expressed the pleasure with which he and the other members of the University not belonging to the medical faculty had seen this last addition to its resources The ViceChancellor in briefly acknowledging the com pliment said that he was glad to find that the memory of his greatgreatgrandfather was still green notes on the reorganisation of the army Medical service By AMS Advisory BoardThere is a looseness in the wording of this paragraph and it is doubtful if the Committee were aware that surgeongenerals are officers of the Army Medical Service but not of the Royal Army Medical Corps It would appear that the two army medical officers who may be appointed to the Advisory Board must not hold a higher rank than that of colonel Thus Colonel J L Notter late Professor of Hygiene at Netley would be excluded on attaining his next step of rank now due while other surgeongenerals all specially selected and possessing wide knowledge of tropical disease would likewise be excluded Appointment of Civil MembersThe civilian physicians and surgeons are required to hold or have recently held a post on the acting staff of a leading civil hospital It is presumed therefore that they are in the enjoyment of lucrative practices It is apparently expected of them that for 200 a year they will devote much time to the public service of their country It is not surprising that Sir William Thomson enters a protest While performing duties beyond a radius I of four miles from Charing Cross the civil members will re ceive in addition to their salary outofpocket expenses i a day railway and cab fares is the usual rate allowed DutiesThe nature of the work is defined and em braces practically the consideration of army medical matters1 in peace and war throughout the Empire It is not made clear in Paragraph 7 if the Advisory Board is to undertake the duties hitherto performed by the Mobilisa tion Committee the Army Sanitary Committee the Central British Red Cross Committee and the Medical Promotion Board All of these have representatives from the medical branch of the War Office The Advisory Board will consider all plans for new hospitals and upon standard plans for bar racks and standing camps which may be submitted Sub mitted by whom  By the InspectorGeneral of Fortifications or Army Sanitary Committee  A report by the Advisory Board is to be submitted to the Secretary of State but the Secretary of State is not an expert on plans and naturally he will refer the subject to his advisers Buildings and sites for camps are matters pertaining to the Quartermaster Generals Department and Fortification Branch but the QuartermasterGeneral is also ex officio President of the Army Sanitary Committee2 and he may already have given approval to the plans submitted The QuartermasterGeneral and InspectorGeneral of Fortifications will therefore act first as pleaders and secondly as judges The annual inspection of each of the military hospitals by a subcommittee consisting of at least one military and one civilian member forms part of the duties It is well that the civil member should clearly understand what he is about to undertake In the various military districts in the United Kingdom there are 138 military hospitals ranging from Colchester and Cork to Inverness At the annual inspection of hospitals in the NorthWestern District the Principal Medical Officer used to spend more than half his days on the railway that record is likely to be beaten by some of the civilian members of the Advisory Board It may no doubt be advantageous in some instances to obtain the views of eminent civilians on army medical matters although their previous training and professional knowledge as experts on disease will not help greatly to good administration The main advantages which the Advisory Board will possess over the DirectorGeneral acting alone will be that its opinion as influencing public opinion is not so likely to be disregarded by the War Office in the future as it has been too often the case in the past when the Director Generals opinion was overridden Against that advantage is the delay that must occur in the performance of the current work of the office There will be numerous instances when the DirectorGeneral will be compelled to act on his own initiative without awaiting the consent of his colleagues on the Board It has long been advocated by the medical profession that the Royal Army Medical Corps should be constituted on the  lines of the Royal Engineers Mr Brodrick knocks that idea on the head I wonder what would be said by Royal Engineer officers were the InspectorGeneral of Fortifications ordered to be associated with an advisory board of eminent civil engineers  Yet if public opinion counts for anything the necessity for such a course is fully as great for the Royal Engineers as it is for the Army Medical Service The present war has put an unprecedented strain upon all branches of the Army but criticism has been directed mainly to the medical side The evidence given before the South African Hospitals Commission was not wanting in detail and in the voluminous report published there is not a single instance of maladministration recorded against the late DirectorGeneral or the officers associated with him Any shortcomings were proved to be due to the want of appre ciation by the War Office officials of the advice given them Mr Brodrick is an adroit politician and no one knows better the effect of drawing a red herring across the scent Examinations for PromotionAs regards the examination for promotion there appears to be a new departure intended The Board of Examiners on which the English Scotch and Irish schools were represented were employed at the entrance1 examination but not for promotion For the latter a London physician and a London surgeon examined on their par ticular subjects while questions regarding regulations interior nS mSSSSJ WATER SUPPLIES AND RIVER POLLUTION TOct 19 1Q01 economy military law etc were framed by experienced Army medical officers Admission to the ServiceThe proposed regulations govern ing admissions into the service indicate little change save that importance will be given to a confidential report from the dean or other authority of a medical school In the large schools such as the Edinburgh School such reports are likely to be extremely vague as regards conduct The giving of commissions to civil surgeons over age who have served with troops in the field is a custom which existed during the Crimean war and has been exercised in many instances during the Boer war but without examination A surgeon who has proved his worth on active service might well have been excused the necessity of an examination and approval of the Advisory Board The conditions destroy the benefits intended The power formerly given to the governing bodies of medical schools to nominate candidates has apparently been withdrawn That power was never exercised save in the case of a dearth of candidates The nominees have been reported by the Netley professors as quite equal professionally to the average candidate received by open competition and superior socially It would perhaps have been more expedient to have awaited the success of the present scheme before cutting off a supply which in the present juncture has proved exceedingly useful Army Medical SchoolThe course of instruct ion at Netley fora surgeon on probation for the Home and for the Indian Service was the same and lasted four months  in future it will be for two months only for the Kings service It remains to be seen whether or not the India Office is prepared to curtail the length of the course at Netley for their candidates if not the professors will be in placed in the awkward position of having to deliver a complete course of lectures to one set of candi dates and a modified course to another Such an arrange ment at best will be exceedingly unsatisfactory and was only had recourse to during this war through the urgent need of personnel Home Surgeons and Home PhysiciansCertain inducements to enter the service are held out to men whilst holding a resi dent appointment in a recognised civil hospital but here again like King Charless head the examination appears House surgeons and physicians have neither the time nor in cl ination to appear for examinations and as most of them have been prizemen of their schools a recommendation from their hospitals should be considered as a sufficient guarantee of their worth Attachment to UnitsThe paragraphs having reference to the attachment of lieutenants to units gives no information regarding the period of attachment nor is it stated whether or not the unit is stationed at home or abroad but judging by paragraphs 29 and 30 it would appear that they will remain at home for at least three years and six months In India and the Colonies there are many medical officers whose tour of foreign service has expired and who require relief It has been possible during the last two years by hurrying lieute nants through their training to send them abroad to meet urgent demands That source of supply will cease India must get her proportion Where are they to come from There is I fear little hope of soon being able to spare officers from South Africa and after the hard work and priva tion incidental to war it is not probable that many will be physically fit to begin a fresh tour of service in India ReserveIt is in accordance with all experience that an officer having once joined the Service intends to make it his future career and if his services prove satisfactory he will be permitted by the scheme to do so or be given permission to retire on engaging for a period of seven years in the reserve receivings a year while so serving There is nothing to show that he will be permitted to resign his commission voluntarily That is a condition which I think few will be willing to accept Liability to recall will exercise a serious effect upon indi viduals If they purchase a practice or enter into partnership 2 a year is a small sum to receive for undergoing the risk of the forfeiture of the money invested During the present war there have been many instances of civil surgeons who out of a sense of patriotism volunteered their services but sub sequently begged to cancel their engagements on account of the pecuniarv sacrifices they were making The proposed regulation i  likely tD prove injurious to the lieutenant and certain to be costly to the State without any compensating advantage whatever For three years and six months while he is preparing for his examination for promotion his services cannot be utilised generally He will continue to be prac tically a probationer while his seniors will be grilling in the plains of India or trekking in South Africa without a chance of escape except through sickness It is presumed also that the rules will apply to all lieutenants now serving many of whom are abroad If so they will have to be recalled without the possibility of boing relieved by others Examination for MajorThe examination for promotion to the rank of major will be attended by difficulties whenever the officer happens to be abroad where facilities do not exist for preparation Jf he be rejected twice he will be compul sorily retired apparently without any gratuity but it seems he can retire with a gratuity if he prefers to do so without examination IndiaPrevious service in India is no longer required for promotion to the rank of colonel and surgeongeneral This is an unfortunate change introduced apparently to benefit the medical officers of the Guards ConclusionFrom the foregoing it is manifest that a medical officers success in life will depend upon the quality of the examination he is capable of passing The period given him to attend civil hospitals is a boon but any one with experience of a system of examinations will condemn it as harassing in the highest de gree moreover it will prove useless for the purpose in tended namely to make the officer a better practitioner When a mans future depends upon the successful accomplish ment of any particular work he naturally will turn to the person who can help him the best and as an aid to pass an examination he will not be found in the hospitals but with the grinder besides the capacity to answer questions well is but a poor test of efficiency in a public service The scheme as drawn out is crude in the extreme and almost every paragraph shows the hand of the amateur in administration The one thing the most urgent and upon which every improvement every reform hangs is an increase of the personnel of the corps and that is not referred to Increase of pay will not compensate for a starved service CONFERENCE ON WATER SUPPLIES AND RIVER POLLUTION A Conference on Water Supplies and River Pollution arranged by the Sanitary Institute was opened at St Andrews Hall London W on Wednesday October 16th when the chair was taken by Professor H Robinson MInstCE in the absence of Sir Alexander Binnie who was unable to be present owing to a domestic bereavement There was a numerous attendance including delegates of many sanitary authorities A series of papers intended to serve as introductions to the discussions had been printed beforehand in a pamphlet and were taken as read Watershed Areas Mr J Parry MInstCE contributed a paper on the protection of watersheds in which he described the two methods of procedure which had been adopted on the one hand the sanitary regulation of watersheds by statutory bylaws and on the other the acquisition of the water sheds by the water authorities and discussed their relative advantages The conclusion at which he arrived was that if water supplies were to be effectually pro tected against all the risks of pollution prejudicial to health which modern science had revealed the sources of supply including the entire area over which rain was collected must be owned by the authority responsible for the waterworks and be managed solely in the interests of the water con sumers With regard to the question how the drainage areas thus acquired could be profitably utilised consistently with the maintenance of the high standard of purity he expressed the opinion that there were many uses to which such lands could be applied as for example sheepfarming plantations and deer parks that would produce some return for the outlay incurred in the purchase and at the same time would satisfy every reasonable demand as to purity The War In South AfricaAuthors Lenthal Cheatle Owen Richards J W Washbourn and M T YarrSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No

to HM Forces in South Africa and Assistant Surgeon to Kings College Hospital Whenever I saw wounds not of recent infliction the following description explains the usual relationship that existed between them and infective or noninfective processes  i The small wound caused by a Mauser or LeeMetford bullet covered by a scab of dry blood clot under which healing had practically taken place 2 A small moist ulcer from which there was a slight sero purulent discharge which contained cocci and obviously infected This wound represented a septic condition of i The sepsis remaining superficial and not extending to deeper parts 3 A small moist infected ulcer communicating with the deep parts which were also septic and from which pus could be squeezed 4 The superficial wound was healed but the deep parts were infected as was seen to be the case in some chest or abdominal wounds In some of the above cases the wounds of entrance or of exit might be represented by the dry scab and the other by one of the effects of infection just described 5 All the larger wounds that is to say those caused by shell or expanding bullets were almost without exception infected either superficially and deeply or only superficially I cannot give the exact proportion between infected and noninfected cases but my own experience is that the cases which were quite free from infection were in the minority perhaps a large minority The average of cases free from in fection was lowered by those from Jacobsdal Paardeberg and Osfontein but even without them the statement holds good It is a well known fact that all wounds in military or civil surgery become infected at the time of their infliction or within a few hours afterwards This is therefore the most critical time of a wound from the point of view of asepsis Hence one concluded that it might be possible to add some precautionary measure to the already valuable first field dress ing which is stitched into the jacket of every soldiers uniform in which he fights Without entering into details this first field dressing consists of antiseptic gauze and wool together with a strip of bandage the whole being contained in a little bag of mackintosh or parchment This dressing is often placed upon the wounds by the patient himself by his nearest neighbour officer or private or by a medical officer By whomever it is applied under the exigencies of circumstances it is almost invariably put on in the absence of a purifying lotion and hence apart from what the bullet or portion of shell takes into the wound the patients skin fingers and clothes or the fingers of his dresser are the chief sources from which in fection is derived It is quite evident that a first field dressing cannot include all the paraphernalia we deem necessary to establish asepsis in hospital practice but at the same time I venture to hope that something might be included with very little additional complication that could inhibit bacterial growth and which could also exert some germicidal action After trying iodoform made into a paste with a 1 in 20 watery solution of carbolic acidwhich however proved unsatisfactoryI used the double cyanide of zinc and mercury salt in the form of powder with which Lord Lister had kindly supplied me on leaving this country I found however that when applying it to a wound in the open air the wind blew more of it over myself than over the area for which it was intended Besides this any powder is difficult to apply to the posterior aspects of the trunk and limbs without greatly disturbing a patient by rolling him over on his face Then I employed this same double cyanide of zinc and mercury powder made into a paste with a 1 in 20 watery solution of carbolic acid This paste had the advantage of the germicidal action of the carbolic acid added to the great inhibitory power exerted over bacterial growth by the double salt It could be applied anywhere and in any wind and further in spite of using it in large quantities and in large wounds I have not seen any poisonous effects nor any sign of local irritation In fact this paste proved most satis factory In using it I rubbed some over my fingers over the skin around the wound and upon the wound itself before putting on the first field dressing It was of course difficult to carefully observe cases that were being left behind or sent away by convoy but every now and then I was able to see them again and they were ail doing well the wounds being all represented by a dry scab in which by careful inspection the double salt could be seen Since I have returned home I have worked out theamount that would be necessary for each field dressing and the method by which it can be carried A tin collapsible tube the same as artists use for their oils is the best carrier for the paste which does not chemically act upon the tin By applying vaseline to the possible outlets for evaporation the paste will remain as such for years even in hot climates The best proportion of the double cyanide of zinc and mercury powder to the carbolic acid solution has been worked out by Mr William Martindale and myself and is as follows  Mercury and zinc cyanide 400 grs  tragacanth in powder 1 gr  carbolic acid 40 grs  sterilised water 800 grs Mix and fill 12 collapsible tin tubes The tragacanth helps to keep the powder in suspension The addition of glycerine is not to be recommended as it might interfere with the rapidity with which the wounds become scabbed over The tube and paste weigh no grains Its presence does not appreciably increase the dressing by weight or bulk In my opinion this paste proves an invaluable addition to a first field dressing and its value cannot be overestimated in in those instances where water cannot be found to make the necessary lotions in the field hospitals All that is required in the way of direction for its use is that the dresser should squeeze out some of the paste upon his own fingers before applying it around and on the wound and after this apply the outer dressings and bandage It may be said that these precautions are too intricate for the surgical instincts of the ordinary soldier but if he is care fully taught the use of the dressing I cannot see that this objection is insuperable To sum up  A first field dressing should consist of a col lapsible tube containing this paste double cyanide gauze and double cyanide wool each in sufficient quantity for two wounds and a bandage with four safety pins the whole being enclosed in a mackintosh bag NOTES ON DYSENTERY FROM THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL SOUTH AFRICA BY Owen Richards MA and J W Washbourn MD Fellow of New College Oxford Physician to Guys Hospital  Physician to the London Fever Hospital  etc Up to the present date 250 cases of dysentery have been treated in this hospital Most of these cases were admitted some time after the beginning of the attack and by them selves are of little value in forming a clinical picture of the disease We have however notes of 20 cases which have been treated here from the commencement and the following description is based partly upon these cases and partly upon an analysis of the cases admitted at various stages of the disease For convenience of description we will divide our cases into four classes A B C and D Class A These cases are unattended by pyrexia the other symptoms are similar to those in Class Bthat is the passage of blood and slime Four of our 20 cases belonged to this class  they were readily amenable to treatment 3 of the patients recovering in 3 5 and 6 days respectively while in the fourth case which was of longer duration the patient was twice discovered taking improper food In a fifth case which recovered in 5 days there was pyrexia for one night only the temperature reaching 1014o Class B Of our 20 cases 14 belonged to this class which is character Sept 8 1900NOTES ON DYSENTERY mSSSL 669 i8ed by a fairly definite pyrexial stage reminding one of the course of a specific fever The pyrexia which is irregular in type reaching ioito 1030 with morning remissions starts at the commencement of the attack and lasts about 6 daysin the 14 cases 4 3 6 4 6 4 5 8 8 6 8 5 6 8 days respect ively The onset is frequently preceded by ordinary diar rhoea lasting a day or two The principal symptoms of the attack are tenesmus with repeated calls to stool and the replacement of the normal faecal evacuations by blood and lime In favourable cases as the temperature falls the evacuations gradually assume a more faecal character and an ordinary diarrhoea persists for a day or two longer the whole attack lasting about 9 days Chart I shows the course of the temperature and the number of evacua tions in a typical case of this class ending in recovery

disease other than nteric the course of the attack corresponded very closely with the above case In two others who were convalescent from enteric diarrhoea con tinued for 17 and 21 days In the ninth case Private A under the care of Dr Breeks the symptoms began in the usual way with pyrexia lasting for 7 days Shortly after the fall of the temperature the motions became fiecal The diarrhoea instead of subsiding continued for five weeks the bowels being open on an average nine times a day He became much emaciated and the abdomen was retracted Recovery ultimately ensued He was treated with ipecacuanha magnesium sulphate opium and bis muth This patient was convalescent from enteric fever at the time when lie was attacked which probably was the cause of the protracted course of the disease The remaining 5 cases in this class who were all con valescent from enteric fever ended fatally The attack began with the usual pyrexial stage In one case death occurred on the 7th day before the fall of temperature and in the others after the temperature had subsided on the nth 12th 13th and 14th days of the attack respectively This unfavourable course was we believe due to the lowered resistance consequent on the attack of enteric fever In two of the cases typhoid ulcers were found at the necropsy in another there was still evidence of enteric in the enlargement of the spleen and mesenteric glands and in the other two the patients were much enfeebled before the dysentery com menced The Charts II III IV and the following brief notes illustrate these cases Private T S under the care of Dr Richmond admitted on May 13th convalescent from enteric temperature having been normal for four days On May 19th he suffered from diarrhcea and on May 20th he began to pass blood and slime the temperature rising to 1014 In spite of treatment the dysenteric symptoms continued and the pulse gradu ally failed He died on May 26th At the postmortem examination dys enteric ulcration was found in the rectum sigmoid flexure and caecum together with small patches in the rest of the colon The lower end of the ileum was inflamed  the spleen and mesenteric glands were enlarged The patient was treated with ipecacuanha opium and astringents Private O  under care of Dr Handson Admitted on May 5th suffering from relapse of enteric The relapse was severe temperature varying between 103 and 104 It became normal on May 23rd and continued so until June 10th when it rose to 996o in the evening On this day the patient suffered from diarrhoea On the nth it reached 10320 in the evening diarrhcea continued The motions were at first fsecal and sub sequently consisted of nothing but blood and slime The temperature became normal on June 16th  the dysentery continued  hiccough de veloped and persisted during the last five days of life The patient died on the 23rd No postmortem examination was made This patient was treated with opium

INOCULATION mSSS 3 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA ANTITYPHOID INOCULATION Dr A E Wright Professor of Pathology in the Army Medical School Netley sends us the following note on the results obtained by the antityphoid inoculations in the beleaguered garrison in Lady smith  By the kind permission of SargponGeneral Jameson CB I am enabled to publish the following officially collected statistics with regard to the results obtained by the anti typhoid inoculations in the military garrison during the siege of Ladysmith Table IResults obtained by the Antityphoid Inoculations in the Case of the Officers and Men of the Military Garrison during the Siege of Ladysmith S I 5 3 o S u a as spL os  as s0 4S Proportion in which Deaths stand to Total Number of Attacks in Group

figures relating to officers separately air also givri in the official statistics With regard to these last it may be pointed out that quite apart from the faet that these figures relate to a quite small group of persons 44 in number the figures considered as statistics are probably fallacious owing to the fact that the group of inoculated officers consisting as it must have done almost if not exclusively of young men at the most susceptible age is compared with a group of officers which includes all the older and less susceptible men and the men who have already suffered from typhoid The figures referred to are none the less subjoined with a view to conforming to the arrangement adopted in the official statistics Table ILResults obtained by the Antityphoid Inoculations

in 220 In drawing inferences from the figures in this table it is to be borne in mind that the erroneous inclusion or exclusion of single case or a difference in the event in the case of any patient included in the category of the inoculated would ensibly alter the present aspect of the table The same circumstance must be borne in mind in connec tion with any attempt to base a comparison of the case mor tality in inoculated and uninoculated upon the figures in Table I For it will be manifest that in no circnmstances oould a trustworthy estimate of casemortality be based on a series of only 35 cases Least of all would it be permissible to do this under conditions such as those of Ladysmith during the siege where many other factors in addition ttf th Severity Of the attack must have determined the favourable or unfavourable event of the cases It would however appear probable in view of the figures given in the table that the casemortality was not influenced by the inoculation On this subject further light must be awaited especially as it would appear from certain statements which have emanated from the seat of war that the disease gener ally runs a milder course in the inoculated The question of casemortality is however quite subordinate in interest to the question as to how far the figures presented in Table I enable us to estimate in quantitative terms the reduction in incidence and mortality which can be achieved by the process of antityphoid inoculation To answer this question it will be necessary to inquire on the one hand whether there were any circumstances other than inoculation which may have tended either to diminish the incidence of typhoid among the inoculated in Ladysmith or unduly to swell the roll of typhoid among the inoculated In connection with the former question the only point which comes up for consideration is the question as to whether the inoculated were more favourably circumstanced in the matter of the sanitation of their camps than the un inoculated No detailed data for the determination of this are at present at hand But this will be seen to be unimportant in view first of the fact that there was in each regiment and corps an uninoculated majority who must equally with the inoculated have benefited or suffered from the sanitary or insanitary condition of the various campe  and secondly of the fact that the inoculated who were attacked were drawn from twelve different corps and regiments It may therefore be assumed that the inoculated ana uninoculated were equally exposed to the risk of infection The question as to whether there were any circumstances which tended unduly to swell the roll of typhoid among the inoculated is one which requires to be treated at somewhat greater length The following points must be kept in view  i So far as is known with hardly an exception the men who are set down as inotilatd were only once inoculated It seems probable from the fact that only two cases among twiceinoculated persons have as yet come to my knowledge that second inoculation confers a considerable additional pro tection 2 It is possible that certain of the officers who are set down as inoculated may have been inoculated with an antityphoid serum and not with a vaccine consisting of a sterilised typhoid culture Two or three instances have been reported to me where this error was committed in the case of officers proceeding to South Africa In the case of the statistics now in question the date and place of inoculation are in the case of 5 out of the 9 officers attacked set down as unknown 3 It is possible in the case of the men as distinguished from the officers that revaccination against smallpox which like antienteric inoculation was in many cases carried out on board the transports may in certain instances have been confused with the latter inoculation Instances of this con fusion have already several times come to my knowledge 4 Lastly it is possible that owing to the exigencies of military service or owing to other reasons the full prescribed dose of typhoid vaccine may not in all cases have been in jected Instances of the employment of the vaccine in fourfold reduced doses have come to my knowledge It is conceivable but there is nothing either to support or rebut the suggestion that some reduction of the dose may have been found neces sary in the case of the Liverpool Regiment which was inocu lated presumably as in the case of other regiments only very partially inoculated at Ladysmith on the eve of the out break of hostilities At any rate it is noticeable that this regiment furnished 13 cases of enteric among the inoculated men whereas the whole rest of the garrison of Ladysmith furnished only an equal number of such cases In view of the above points regarding which there is not at present any information available it is at this stage impossi ble to determine precisely to what extent the inoculated were protected by inoculation But the results set forth in Table I would appear to be distinctly encouraging inasmuch  as they show that the proportion on the one hand of attacks and on the other hand of deaths from typhoid was seven times smaller in the inoculated than in the uninoculated and it may be borne in mind that if the number no doubt a I considerable one of men who had previously suffered from typhoid had been subtracted from the number of the unin I oculated as might quite legitimately have been done the statistics would have borne an even more favourable aspect 4 MBj5UMORTALITY OF TYPHOID FEVERJuly 14 1900 THE INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY OP TYPHOID FEVER This subject is at present attracting the anxious attention of the public owing to the severe epidemic which has affected the troops in South Africa but which is now there is reason to hope beginning to decline Incidence While it is a truism that prevention is better than cure this aspect of the subject seems to have been almost entirely overlooked except by Sir Walter Foster in the discussion which took place in the House of Commons From this point of view the statement of percentage mortality is of very little value because if there had only been a small incidence of the disease a heavy mortality would not have been a very serious matter but when we are informed that about 10 per cent of the whole army of 220000 men have been affected with typhoid fever a deathrate of 21 per cent gives a total mortality of four or five regiments or over 4000 men It would seem therefore that the primary defect must have been in the sanitary administration of this large body of men While the difficulty of preventing soldiers in a hot climate after an exhausting march from drinking the polluted water of the Modder River may be admitted it seems clear from Mr Watson Cheynes letter published in the British Medical Journal of May 5th that the transport was so cut down that there were no means for boiling water while the filtering appliances failed to supply this deficiency Epidemics rarely occur when men are on the march but only after they have settled down in camp for a few weeks and it is evident that this is what occurred in South Africa When men are on the march they leave their dejecta the sick and other sources of contagion behind them  but when they have halted for a few weeks it has been the invariable experi ence of all previous campaigns that typhoid fever has made its appearance Our painful experience on this occasion will it is to be hoped impress on commanding officers the para mount importance of attention to the sanitary administration of camps in the future The Special Commission for which Lord Roberts has asked will doubtless inquire what means were adopted to prevent the occurrence and limit the spread of this disease  what means to prevent the contamination of the water supply and to destroy any pathogenic organisms which it contained  what means were taken for the disposal of the excreta  whether Mr Trevess plague of flies was allowed to carry typhoid bacilli direct from the faeces to the food supply  what means were adopted to disinfect the emanations from the sick The reply of the UnderSecretary of State for War to Sir Walter Foster shows that the means adopted were ineffective The admissions of cases and of deaths from typhoid fever in the Bloemfontein hospitals during the eight weeks ending May nth were Admitted Died

yet told so that it is impossible to return the deathrate Dr Conan Doyle while speaking very highly in our last issue of the manner in which all concerned met and dealt with this  calamity draws a very gruesome picture of the epidemic itself It was appalling in its severity both in quantity and quality  I know of no instance of such an epidemic in modern warfare I have not had access to any official figures but I believe that in one month there were from 10000 to 12000 men down with this the most debilitating and lingering of continued fevers I know that in one month 600 men were laid in the Bloemfontein Cemetery A single day in this one town saw 40 deaths Such an epidemic in any of our large towns would have created a panic It is practically impossible to get exact data as to the inci dence of typhoid fever in civil life notwithstanding the noti fication of infectious diseases but we can readily get th mortality in every 100000 inhabitants Year Por 100000

menincidence 10 per cent r deaths ax per cent   about 2000 per 100000 When an army is in camp the water supply is a matter of the first importance but many other preventive measure should be adopted the majority of which can be summed up in the words absolute cleanliness When the disease broke out it would become necessary to take special precau tions regarding the disinfection and disposal of the excreta and this applies to the urine and other emanations from the sick as well as to the faeces The supervision of all food supply to the sick and healthy to ensure that it is above suspicion is another duty which calls for the exercise of great care Regarding the mortality all information supports Dr Conan Doyles statement that everything possible was done for the patients by the medical men nurses and orderlies with the means at their disposal and that the deathrate was as low as could be expected under the circumstances Results op Expectant and Symptomatic Treatment Still there may be an advantage even now of comparing deathrates under widely different systems of treatment withy the view of arresting medical attention and improving on the expectant and symptomatic treatment which has hitherto prevailed in this country The UnderSecretary of State fop War says that uthe percentage mortality in enteric cases during the war and more especially at Bloemfontein ha been 21 per cent of the admissions to hospital This no doubt represents the condition up to date but as there i likely to be still further mortality among the recent admis sions it is too soon to arrive at any definite conclusion on the subject No doubt 21 per cent compares favourably with many of our statistics both at home and abroad as will be seen from the following table As our soldiers are mostly young men between 20 and 30 years of age in comparing army with civil statistics we have taken the mortality of males at similar ages Mortality in Year

790 The above statistics are drawn from a large number of cases and fairly represent the results which have been attained by the expectant and symptomatic system of treatment in male at the ages specified For the purpose of comparison with the results of hydrotherapeutic measures we must take the figures for all ages and both sexes During the years 18719 the number of cases of enteric fever treated in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board was 12017 with a Per centage mortality of 174 Results op Hydrotherapeutic Treatment No doubt there have been many large epidemics in this country where the type of the disease has been comparatively mild and the mortality low In the Maidstone epidemia there were 1886 cases and 141 deaths giving a percentage mortality of 76 Perhaps the only favourable statistics in July 14 1900IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITALS mjoSSa 5 this country over a series of years from the expectant treat ment were obtained at the Cork Street Fever Hospital Dublin where between 1871 and 1890 inclusive there were 1405 cases at all ages with a deathrate of 86 per cent These exceptional statistics do not detract from the value of the uniformly favourable results which have attended the use of hydrotherapeutic measures Liebermeister showed that at the Basle Hospital the deathrate was reduced under the coldbath treatment from 273 to 82 per cent Dr Hare has shown that at the Brisbane Hospital during the expectant period out of 1828 cases 271 died giving a percentage mortality of 148 while during the bath period out of 1902 cases only 143 died or 75 per cent This is very striking evidence in favour of the bath treatment obtained from two sets of cases in the same hospital under otherwise precisely similar conditions Of 685 cases under the care of Professor Osier only 8 per cent died in the Red Cross Hospital at Lyons the deathrate was 73 per cent at the German Hospital Philadelphia under the care of Dr J C Wilson the deathrate was 78 per cent In the Philadelphia Medical Journal of March 3rd Dr J C Wilson and Dr J L Salpinger give the result of ten years experience in the treatment of enteric fever by systematic cold bathing based on 1904 cases collected from fever hospitals in Philadelphia with a death rate of 75 per cent In the German army where Brands system is rigorously carried out the deathrate for many years has been less than 8 per cent In the American army from 1888 to 1897 inclusive out of 1303 cases there were 141 deaths or 108 per cent In 1898 there were 1415 cases with a death rate slightly under 9 per cent It may have been quite impossible to carry out any systematic bath treatment in the South African hospitals but cold sponging and cold compresses are always available Dr Barr of Liverpool has been for soanae time swinging severe cases in hammocks in substitution for his continuous bath treatment Here the patients can be submitted to a con tinuous stream of tepid water or an occasional douche of cold water This method is very simple and very effective in con trolling the temperature Under no circumstances should overcrowding be permitted Personally if suffering from typhoid fever we would rather sleep under the canopy of heaven than in any close hospital or tent Febrile patients do not catch cold THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITALS The work done by the Committee of the Imperial Yeomanry Hospitals is remarkable both by its extent and its excellence The original Imperial Yeomanry Hospital of 500 beds which was established at Deelfontein was shortly followed by the the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer Company The hospital at Deelfontein has been increased until Mr Fripp the Senior Surgeon was able to report on June 18th that he had 600 beds completely equipped A branch hospital at Maitland Camp near Capetown has now been taken over and will be placed in the charge of Dr Saunders one of the medical officers of the Deelfontein Hospital In addition a branch hospital for 400 beds will be opened at Pretoria within the next few weeks Major Reade RAMC has been ap pointed commandant and the members of the medical staff sent out from this country are as follows  Mr W Langdon Brown Physician MA MB and Mr Herbert Wil liamson Surgeon MA MB St Bartholomews Hospital Dr Sandwith MD FRCP M RCS

addition 82 ward orderlies and 8 ward maids The Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer Company have reached Pretoria after having on the way up been of great service at the action of Roodeval Mr Alfred D Fripp writes that on June 15 th the hospital at Deelfontein received two trains full of sick and wounded The first train was theearliest out of Mafeking the second train brought the sick and wounded from Winberg and Senekal and out of its 96 occupants no fewer than 50 were stretcher cases that is to say patients so gravely ill that they had to be carried from the train to their beds Of the wounded from Senekal he writes  Many of the wounded from the latter neighbourhood presented a feature which was entirely novel to our experience in that they were burned more or less severely It seems that our troops had had to advance through veld fires A few of them were burned in running through others only got their burns when they fell to the ground wounded  but from the accounts of the survivors I fear that there must have been others again still less fortunate who when they fell to the ground were unable to move and were burnt to death Colonel Sloggett the military medical officer in command of the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital left at once with this train for Mafeking to bring down the remainder of the sick and wounded from that place Fortunately when the railway was blown up north of Kroonstadt the hospital trains were south of that place There are now three such trains a third having recently been improvised out of ordinary saloon carriages with a kitchen truck in the middle Mr Fripp has to report a considerable amount of sickness among the staff at Deelfontein He writes  We have had to turn one of the smallest huts into a sick room for the sisters They are so closely packed in the ordinary sisters sleeping huts that it is extremely inconvenient there when one of them is ill I am glad to say that there are no serious cases amongst them but their work is very heavy now and their sick room is in perpetual request for slight cases Greenfield and Parker the other two doctors who I told you had enteric are both doing well Three others of our medical staff have had to be admitted the officers ward during the past week but we do not think that any of them have enteric Exactly a quarter of the orderlies we brought with us are now sick in hospital THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALESS CONVALESCENT HOME It is announced that the Prince and Princess of Wales have fitted up a very pretty farmhouse close to Sandringham for the use of officers in valided from the war who need convalescent help The intention is to offer the home in the first place to colonial officers who during their stayy will be the guests of the Prince and Princess Hospitals in RomaniaIn the Archives Orientales de Mdecine et de Chirurgie Dr Cosma de Ploiesti gives some statistics which appear to show that Roumania is more liberally supplied with hospitals than most countries of larger size For a total population of 5000000 there are 188 hospitals with an aggregate number of 7334 beds All patients are treated gratuitously without distinction of nationality and the foreigners from neighbouring countries admitted every year to the hospitals of Roumania are numbered by thousands The hospitals are kept up by the State or by the Communes or by the private administrative bodies called Ephorias which manage special funds bequeathed by charitable persons The hospital establishments are subdivided as follows   Fiftythree departmental or district hospitals with 1355 beds  26 communal hospitals with 756 beds  33 rural hospitals with 1602 beds  10 belong ing to the Bucharest Ephoria with 1016 beds 11 under the Jassy Ephoria with 638 beds  10 maintained out of private funds with 591 beds  11 maintained by Jewish communities with 289 beds  5 lunatic asylums with 749 beds  11 homes for infirm people with 405 beds  1 hospital for sufferers from gellagra with 40 beds  16 homes for aged persons with 324 eds 2 night refuges with 40 beds In addition to these there are 6 nursing homes with 137 beds for paying patients The Queens NursesThe annual report of the Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses states that the demand during the past year invariably exceeded the supply although more nurses had been placed on the roll than in the previous year The expenditure for the year had amounted to  746 of which 2500 was paid out of the money of the Queens Commemoration Fund Princess Henry of Battenberg pre sented the badges and certificates to the nurses on July 5th The President of the Institute said that icco nurses had been enrolled of whom 533 had been trained in England and at least twothirds of the whole number in the United Kingdom The Treasurer stated that the financial resources of the insti tute were taxed to the utmost and that the original endow ment was now found to be insufficient for the work to be done After the distribution Sir Dyce Duckworth one of the Council of the Institute congratulated the nurses and said that though the training already given was of a high character he hoped that it would be improved in the future and in par ticular that a term of three years training in hospital would be required The War In South AfricaSource

Archibald Watson MD FRCSEng Professor of Anatomy and Operative Surgery at the Adelaide University S Australia  late Consulting Surgeon to the Forces in Natal Pieter maritzburg November 10th During the time the late Sir William Stokes was in Natal he contributed some interesting experiences to your pages re garding the hospitals on the lines of communication in Natal notably those of Lady smith and Mooi River His untimely demise rendered it impossible to place on record his impressions of the excellent work done in the military hospitals at Pietermaritzburg where the special faci lities which he enjoyed as Consulting Surgeon to HM Forces enabled him to appreciate at their true value the efforts of those who controlled that huge institutionthe Military Hos pital at Fort Napier with its 1000 beds and the auxiliary hos pitals which were integral parts thereof namely the College Hospital with 300 beds the Legislative Assembly Hospital with 66 beds and the Municipal Hospital Greys with 50 of its beds devoted to military patients The General Hospital at Fort Napier is in itself a maze of scattered buildings including the garrison church which after the battle of Colenso had to be equipped and turned into a ward The smaller hospitals above mentioned were all about a mile and a half to two miles distant from the General Hospital and at opposite points of the town and thus it will bejseen that the PMO LieutenantColonel P H Johnston RAMC found himself suddenly confronted with a most difficult problem at the beginning of hostilities but succeeded wi hin a few days in transforming all these institutions into hospitals of a very efficient type This feat was not accomplished without the able co operation of Majors Anthony Dodd and A L F Bate RAMC Divisional Officer Last June the former met with an accident through his horse falling and was invalided to England to the sincere regret of everyone associated with him  his heavy duties as Registrar and Secretary then devolved on Major Bate an officer whose iron constitution has eaved him throughout his career from appearing on the sick list I am indebted to him for the following statistics  The greatest number of sick and wounded under treatment in one day after the battle of Colenso was 1348 The number of patients invalided to England wag 3500 The number of operations performed was 260 chiefly for gunshot wounds and of these a very comprehensive and instructive report illustrated by many beautiful x ray photographs has been prepared by Dr Irvine Civil Surgeon attached to the KAMC The good results obtained by the surgeons apart from their personal skill were in great part due to the amazing rapidity with which the wounded were transferred to Maritzburg and carried from the station to the fort by the use of the McCor mackBrook pattern of wheel stretcher which provided it is handled as directed by the inventors can scarcely be improved upon From a civilian point of view the General Hospital Maritz burg was all the more difficult to administer as the personnel was constantly changing nurses atid doctors coming and going nevertheless benefit resulted by thus feeding other hospitals nearer the front with medical officers nurses and orderlies who during their period of service at Fort Napier had become more or less familiar with military discipline and the exigencies of military surgery As the campaign drew to a close the subsidiary institutions reverted to their original purposes The Gem ral Hospital Fort Napier was gradually converted into a stationary hospital of 2co beds and thebulkof the patients there were trausf erred to Howick where the hospital is more modern and more salubriously situated than that at Maritzburg from which it is separatedby little over an hours ride by rail It is controlled by Major West cott PMO and besides the sick from Gfneral Bullers forces has latterly received the wounded from General Frenchs army outside the bounds of Natal General Sir Rdvers Bailer V C etc and Colonel Gallwey CB PMO of flatal seeuted the site on which the Howick Hospital stands and General Bui 1er naturally takes a pride in it Nevertheless when he visid the General Hospital Maritzburg for the last timj he pa d the highest tritute in his power to LieutenantColonel Armfctrong Acting SMO KAMC and Major Bate RAMC in the absence of LieutenantColonel Johnston who wss temporarily on the sick list as a result of the great strain to which he had been subjected during the whole of the previous twelve months In conclusion I would like to say that in common with Sir William Stokes Sir Thomas Fitzgerald and Professor J Chiene late consulting surgeons to HM Forces I fail to see that any other system than the one persistently followed by the authorities in Maritzburg could have produced similar favourable results an opinion which had he lived Sir William Stokes would undoubtedly have placed on record IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL Mr L Vernon Cargill FRCS who has now returned to London after acting as ophthalmic surgeon to the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital since its establishment at Dee If ont ein sends us some notes which bring the history of the hospital down to November ioth shortly before he left At that date there were 492 patients in hospital of whom nearly fourfifths were Yeomen Most of the cases then being received were convalescents and the staff of the hospital at Deelfontein had been further reduced by the departure not only of Mr Cargill but also of Messrs Christopherson and Ashdown for England while Dr Washbourn was engaged with the Branch Hospital at Pretoria Perforation in Enteric Fever Mr Cargill states that three cases of perforation in enteric fever had been operated upon but none had recovered The following is the report of the last case  The patient a man aged 30 was under the care of Dr Elliot Perfora tion occurred in the fourth week of the disease which was severe and marked by much toxaemia Distension was not great At the time of per foration the pulse was 96 and the temperature 1012o F There was no fall of temperature with the perforation although the pain was sudden and severe enough to make the patient call out and to double him up in bed During the next few hours the temperature gradually rose to 102 6 Ft and the pulse to 1x6 Tenderness and rigidity increased in the lower half of the abdomen Mr Ball an ce operated within six hours of the attack of pain and found the perforation immediately under the laparotomy wound in a coil of the ileum 18 inches from the caecum It was one sixteenth of an inch in diameter and there had been very little leakage into the abdominal cavity The aperture was closed by eight Halsted silk sutures quite half an inch of the wall of the bowel being unfolded on each side of it Asa precautionary measure a few stitches were placed in another Peyers patch 12 inches from the caecum to unfold its very thin base The intestinal coils and Douglass pouch were sponged dry No irrigation or drainage was used The patient progressed extremely well for the next fortyeight hours the pulse came down to under 90 the temperature was subnormal there was no pain and it wag thought that he would pull through At the end of this time however he again com plained of abdominal pain distension came on rapidly the temperature I rose to 1026 F the pulse to 144 and he died fiftysix hours from tne time of operation There was no vomiting either at the time of the initial perforation or subsequently At the necropsy it was seen that another minute perforation had occurred through the base of the same ulcer as before along the track of one of the sutures and had caused the second attack of peritonitis The whole of the Peyers patch which was a very wide one had not been infolded at the operation as too much narrowing of the lumen of the bowel was feared There was extensive ulcration in the lower 3 feet of the ileum and also in the caecum Enteric Fever and Dysentery The number of cases ot enteric fever admitted during the month preceding the date of the report had increased but the general type of disease was less severe than formerly owing as was believed to the better condition and therefore greater resisting power of the men The frequency of phlebitis in the convalescent stage was noticeable and suppurative otitis media was also far from uncommon Two cases complicated with malaria gave Widals reaction and also showed the ter tian parasite in the biood A few cases of acute and many of chronic dysentery have been admitted and have done well Trial was being made of various native remedies for the treat ment of dysentery but the cases so treated had been few in number and the results had not been very striking Cardiac and Renal Disease The number of cases of cardiac and renal disease admitted had increased Some of the cardiac cases were instances of valvular disease arising during an attack of acute rheumatism but the majority were examples of failure of compensation due to the strain of hard work and exposure on an already damaged heatt To the sime causes the cases of acute kidney aflfV ction can be traced Rheumatism especially the subs cute articular Deo is 1900LITERARY NOTESj5 i739 and muscular varieties is still very common It is interest ing to note that in the great majority of the former and in many of the latter there is a history of previous acute rheu matism Acute rheumatism is and has been conspicuous by its absence though many patients convalescent from the dis ease have been admitted Dr Elliot remarks that from what he has seen here he would be inclined if examining men for war purposes to reject all or nearly all who have passed through an attack of rheumatic fever The selection of men for the Yeomanry battalions has apparently been made on specially liberal lines Many cases of old standing valvular and renal disease have come out and one man arrived in hospital with an unhealed nephrotomy wound with which he had left home Other cases have come under the care of the Ophthalmic Surgeon of Yeomen who have been passed and sent out for active service in the field the condition of whose eyes and sight should have led to their rejection ENTERIC FEVER AT MOOI RIVER HOSPITAL The following extracts from a letter dated October 24th from Major Henry H Johnston RAMC who has been in charge of the medical or enteric fever division of Mooi River Hospital Natal since January 29th is of interest as showing how the risk of infection to the hospital staff and orderlies who are in direct attendance upon the enteric fever cases may by the exercise of care be kept down to a very low percentage as compared with even the surgical division of the same hos pital In a letter dated September 26th Major Johnston men tioned that the percentage of deaths among the enteric fever patients in this hospital since it was opened in January had been lowered to slightly under the 10 per cent at which it stood when we published his letter of August 10th in our issue of September 15thnamely 118 deaths out of 1209 cases exclusive of officers The enteric fever disinfection carried out in this hospital since February last has been very successful Although 45 per cent of the personnel have been employed in the enteric fever wards only about 36 per cent of the cases of enteric fever have occurred among them the remaining 74 per cent of cases having occurred among the personnel employed in other parts of the hospital so that the risk of enteric fever infection among the orderie3 employed in the enteric fever wards has always been about half of what it was among the orderlies employed in other parts of the hos pital Notwithstanding that every precaution was taken to detect cases of enteric fever among patients transferred from other hospitals on their arrival here so as to ensure their isolation a certain number in the early stages of the disease escaped notice and were treated for days or weeks in the general wards of the hospital before they were diagnosed and transferred to the enteric fever wards in the medical division of the hospital Such cases no doubt were sources of infection as adequate pre cautions against the spread of infection were not taken During an outbreak of enteric fever all excreta should be disinfected and incinerated as it is impossible to detect every case of enteric fever in its early stages in the general wards of a hospital There has not been a single case of enteric fever among the officers and civil surgeons em ployed in this hospital but out of about 750 men of other ranks there have been 34 cases 9 of which occurred among the orderlies employed in the enteric fever wards and 25 among the noncommissioned officers and men employed in other parts of the hospital Of the above number 3 only have been contracted since June ist and 1 of these was contracted in the Transvaal when the patient had been detached on temporary duty for several weeks As regards the 9 cases contracted among orderlies employed in the enteric fever wards several were probably due to carelessness on the part ot the orderlies some of whom were punished for eating their meals and sleeping in vacant beds in the enteric fever wards To lessen these risks the orderlies were supplied with improvised hay mattresses in their own tents and a hot meal was provided for the night orderlies at 3 am The following is the meteorology of Mooi River for September  Mean temperature in protected shade 4500 feet above sea level minimum 453 F

Southampton for the purpose of inspecting the hospital ship named after her It had shortly before arrived from South Africa with a third draft of ill and wounded soldiers Of the 170 patients comprising this draft over 100 were confined to their cots when the ship left CspeTown but on arriving at Southampton only 9 were bedridden One case however had proved fatal and that was the only death which had occurred on board while the Princess of Wales had been in use as a hospital ship The total number of admissions of sick and wounded for treatment had been 728 It is greatly to be hoped that the ship the fitting out of which cost at least 8000 will not be dismantled but no orders have as yet been received for its return to South Africa and the Committee are apprehensive that it will be paid off THE WELSH HOSPITAL At a meeting of the General Committee of the Welsh Hospital on December 10th a report on the present position of the hos pital and the work it had accomplished was read by Sir David Evans Between June 5th and September 24th 757 patients had been treated in the hospital most of whom were suffering either from enteric fever or gunshot wounds The number of fatal cases was only 8 Not a single case of gunshot injury needed amputation a result ascribed to the clean perforation made by the Mauser bullet and to the use of the telephone probe The following resolution was proposed by Sir John Williams and seconded by Viscountess Barker President of the Ladies Committee  The Committee of the Welsh Hospital in South Africa desire to record their profound sorrow for the death of the originator of the hospital and their able and devoted secretary Professor Alfred Hughes who when the hospital was in serious difficulties owing to deaths and illness among the staff volunteered to go to South Africa to undertake its management and while in the discharge of his duties at Pretoria fell a victim to enteric fever The Committee feel that no nobler example of selfsacrifice can be found in the annals of medicine They would convey to the sorrowing widow children and relatives their deepest sympathy and at the same time express their highest appreciation of his selfsacrificing services in the cause of the sufferers in the war THE LANGMAN HOSPITAL Twentytwo of the staff and five of the nurses of the Langman Hospital accompanying 7 officers and 381 men sick and wounded arrived at Plymouth on December 8th The medical arrangements on board the transport were in charge of the staff of the Langman Hospital

SOUTH AFRICA rFEB 17 1900 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA BULLET INJURIES OF NERVE TRUNKS AND OF THE SPINAL CORD IN my last letter I mentioned that I had seen in the hospitals at Wynberg Cape Colony a number of interesting cases of bullet wounds in which nerve trunks had been injured and in this letter I propose to discuss these and also certain cases of injury of the spinal cord In most of the cases in which nerve trunks were injured by bullet wounds of the limbs the track of the bullet healed readily but when the patients were seen at Wynberg they were found with the limb partly or wholly paralysed over the area corresponding to the distribution of one or more of the nerve trunks Even when the symptoms appeared to indicate complete division of the nerve this was aftewards found not to be the case In some no doubt the division was complete and from the direction of the wound a large extent of the nerve must have been utterly destroyed But presumably in some the nerve trunk was merely grazed Such an injury however when inflicted by a bullet travelling at a very high velocity not only damages the nerve seriously but leads secondarily to changes of degeneration that ensue with great rapidity The pain usually is very severe in the limb and in proportion to the gravity of the wound as regards life these cases are distressing Yet they seemed hopeful and the symptoms varied with such rapidity that in not a few instances operations proposed were postponed on account of improvement There were few injuries in the hospital that will better repay careful watching at home The majority of these men will be invalided back to England the rule now in force being that no man unlikely to be fit for duty within two months is to be retained in hospital unless too ill to admit of removal INJURY OF MUSCULOSPIRAL NERVE A man in No 2 Hospital shot through the back of the arm at the level of the midpoint of the musculospiral groove had a marked zone of hyperaesthesia ansesthesia over the area supplied by the musculo spiral and paralysis of extensors The man was wounded about December ioth I899 but I am unable now to refer to the exact date The humerus was un injured The symptoms were held to be due to partialpos sibly totaldivision of the nerve below the level at which the nerve supply for the triceps comes off for this muscle could act The question of operative interference was raised but it was decided to wait and watch the development of the case A week later the condition had materially altered for the better Some power of extending the fingers returned almost suddenly according to the mans account The extensors of the forearm could be felt to contract but there was still marked wrist drop Supination was performed by the action of the biceps alone The hyperesthesia which had been a marked feature was notably diminished Pain which had been severe in the palm of the hand a phenomenon difficult of explanation but which seemed genuine and which I have noted in another case of the same sort was improved Alto gether the improvement was so decided that the question of operation was further postponed Ihe wound in this instance was at a right angle to the course of the nerve and as the bone appeared uninjured the actual damage to the trunk could hardly have been deep LESIONS OF DISTANT TISSUES IN PERFORATING WOUNDS OF LIMBS I have cited this case at some length as it is a fairly typical example of a rather common injury So far as present ex perience goes and it must be admitted that the experience is so short that one must speak very guardedly the main points of these cases appear to be three i The first is that the hyperaesthesia is very marked comes on early and alters rapidly 2 The second is that profound nerve symptoms may occur without the nerve being severed These may be due to bruising or grazing of the nerve trunk but it would seem that they may even be present where the nerve is not touched at all The small bore projectile travel ling at high velocity drills a perfectly clean passage through the tissues often through bone but the effects are widely felt by the tissues Ecchymosis for instance often appears far from the bullet track in places where it is doubtful if the extravasated blood can possibly have extended Distant parts seem violently stretched by the passage of the bullet as the fascia of the thigh is often stretched in sprains of the ankle The bullet might therefore entail what the Germans call a violent Erschutterung of the nerve trunk by passing in its immediate vicinity without directly injuring the cord Thus in one case I saw the ulnar nerve carefully exposed in the lower part of the axilla in the hope of relieving symptoms of a similar nature to those described above The cicatricial track of the missile was seen but it did not affect the ulnar or any other of the nerve trunks nor was the ulnar nerve other than perfectly normal in appearance In another case a large nerve trunk was involved in the cicatricial track of a Mauser bullet which had perforated the ilium and judging by its direction had injured the nerve a little below the sciatic notch It may be observed incident ally that the almost undeviating4iraok of these bullets what ever the tissues they meet with renders the task of the sur geon to some extent easier The patient suffered extremely from pain along the course and distribution of the sciatic nerve The hyperaesthetic area was extensive and most marked In this case as in some others the tenderness of the tibia was marked There was foot drop The diagnosis made was bruising of the sciatic nerve and involvement in cicatricial tissue This diagnosis was borne out to the letter Some two inches below the exit of the nerve trunk it was found caught in cicatricial tissue as tough and dry as that following a burn This cicatricial tissue compressed the nerve and grooved it as a fibrous ring compresses a strangulated hernia All this tough material was dissected off and the nerve set free The immediate afterresults as regards the pain were satisfactory but the foot drop persisted and the greatly wasted flexor muscles of the thigh acted only in the feeblest manner The further progress of this case I hope to detail later 3 The third noteworthy point in connection with these nerve cases is the astonishing power of recovery and the extent to which the diagnosis of the precise amount of injury may be mistaken BULLET WOUNDS OF THE SPINAL CORD In some degree injuries of the spinal cord present the same features as those of minor nerve trunks None of the cases in hospital seem more hopeless and none are on that very account more distressing than gunshot wounds involv ing the cord The most remarkable feature of these cases is the astonishing rapidity of the degenerative changes In a day or two in many instances deep sloughing sores have formed over the sacrum and others where there is not the slightest pressure Cystitis sets in early and in three or four weeks perhaps the patient has run through all the changes that in civil hospitals we see in traumatic cases accomplished only in months An intensely acute sharply limited zone of hyperaesthesia is a usual symptom The level of this varies almost from day to day If there is any grave lesion of the cord from a bullet or from the driving of frag ments of bone into the vertebral canal the wound may be set down as mortal as far as can be judged at present If the bullet has travelled down the long axis of the spine the amount of destruction is enor mous Even when the wound is transverse affecting but a small extent of the cord the area of damage may bevery great as the following case will show A private was wounded at Magersfontein the bullet a Mauser judging by the wounds entering the back about the level of the sixth dorsal spine about 4 inches to the side of the middle line and passing out transversely at a corresponding point on the other side Com plete paraplegia and loss of sensation ensued Sores rapidly formed over the sacrum and elsewhere and the man died some three weeks after the injury all the usual trophic changes have succeeded one another with great rapidity The FIB 1 7 1900 IMPRESSIONS OF MILITARY SURGERY T f o 4 7 bullet wounds healed kindly As the Mauser bullets seldom or never deflect it is possible to judge very closely of the structures likely to be injured At times it may be remarked the most difficult but still straightforward problems of sur gical anatomy confront the surgeon In this case it seemed impossible that the bullet could have done more than skirt the back of the vertebral canal and the symptoms were therefore attributed either to haimorrhage compressing the cord a graze of the cord or injury from fragments of bone The condition of the patient rendered the idea of operation hopeless At the postmortem examination the laminae of the dorsal vertebra were found fractured A mass of finely com minuted bone the size of a large pea was driven into it but did not perforate the dura mater Some of the fragments of bone were exceedingly sharp and seemed to pin the meningzes to the cord The membranes were adherent over an area the size of a shilling and extremely congested over an area the size of a fiveshilling piece As soon as the loose pieces of bone were removed the compressed cord rose up and save for the area of congestion looked normal On slitting up the membranes however some three inches of the cord below the site of compression was found reduced to a complete pulp entirely disintegrated and diffluent No other injury was found No case could have seemed more promising for operation With the utmost ease the comminuted bone compressing the cord could have been removed and the operator would doubt less have congratulated himself on a probable success Operation however would not it was evident have done the slightest good even though it had been performed immedi ately after the receipt of the injury The wound was mortal from the first The condition of the cord was almost certainly due to the immediate consequences of the injury and not to any secondary degenerative changes These might have been possibly stayed by operative interference but the ultimate issue would have been the same and probably life would not have been in the least degree prolonged or rendered less painful The case is a fairly typical one When the cord is actually traversed and a portion injured in its long axis or grazed the prognosis is of the gravest nature In some instances where the bullets have passed close to the cord symptoms similar to actual lesion show at once but after a whilea few days perhapssome sensation returns or some little power of move ment is noticed Such cases are difficult of explanation Extravasation of blood into the canal may be the cause but it is more than doubtful whether this common explanation is often the true one Similar symptoms as already mentioned occur when the bullets travel near nerve trunks in which dis secting operations have revealed no nakedeye changes To attribute the symptoms in these cases in which the cord or the large nerve trunks are not actually implicated to  nerve shock is really rather to beg the question Terms of this nature do not really either advance knowledge or assist in treatment However great the velocity of the bullet as it traverses the tissues and however clearly it may appear to perforate the structures there is yet good evidence that remote structures may be violently stretched or lacerated Extravasations are often seen at points rQmote from the line of the bullet wound which are niot to be explained by the trackingof thebloodextravasatedabouttheinjury The nerve shock  is more probably as in the case of the nerve trunks essentially due to a direct  commotion or  Erschutterung Possibly it may be said that  shock is quite as good and scientific a term as those given I will yield the point at once if it be allowed that the symptoms are actually produced by mechanical injury The term  shock  is so often employed to explain conditions in which it is assumed that the changes are physiological rather than anatomical that I desire to avoid it It is perhaps still too theoretical to assume that the passage of the projectile through the tissues in the close neighbourhood of important structures such as spinal cord or large nerve trunks produces vibratory effects sufficient to account for their disorganisation but certainly such an hypothesis furnishes a fairly satisfactory explanation of the effects actually observed A case bearing out the above remarks now in the hospital at Maritzburg may be briefly cited The bullet a Mauser entered 2 inches below the acromion process of the left shoulder at the posterior border of the deltoid There was no exit wound There was from the first complete paralysis of move ment of both lower limbs The probable direction of the bullet was towards the dorEolumbar spine but the condition of the man precluded skiagraphy There had been no hiemoptysis and the resonance on the left side was natural so that in all probability there was no wound of the pleural cavity or lung The wound was received at Colenso on December 15th 1859 The condition on January ioth was as follows There was no power of movement whatever in either leg The reflexes wele absent The abdominal muscles moved normally in respira tion As regards sensation Over the skin area supplied by the anterior crural trunk sensation was impaired but not absent Over that supplied by the small sciatic it was normal Over that supplied by the great sciatic it was much impaired and in places hypersesthetic Sensation over the distribution of the geniocrural nerve was normal There was extreme tenderness of the left testis but the gland itself was normal Sensation over the abdomen was natural There was a sharplylimited band of hypersesthesia at the level of the ensiform cartilaae Above and below this the sensation was normal The skin over the sacrum was red and a sore was threatened but there were no sores elsewhere Control of bladder was almost complete but some cystitis had begun There was constipation There was no evidence of fracture of the spine It is of course possible that in this instance one or more of the vertebrie had been broken up to some extent but it seems impossible that the cord was directly injured by the bullet Yet the symptoms were bilateral There was no indication of progressive myelitis The mans condition generally was bad and the case seemed likely to drift slowly to a fatal issue In one or two other cases in which the bullet had passed close to the cord the symptoms of actual lesion were present for a time but then rapidly altered for the better and there was a fair prospect of recovery CLINTON T DENT SOME IMPRESSIONS OF MILITARY SURGERY IN SOUTH AFRICA By G H MAKINs FRCS Consulting Surgeon with the Forces IICLINICAL SIGNS AND COURSE OF THE WOUNDS THRE actual infliction of the wound gives rise to little pain usually a sharp burning sensationand is followed by remarkably little shock severe shock is in fact uncommon even when vital organs are struck Omitting the cases in which a large vascular trunk is struck in a limb or in the body external hsemorrhage is slight and even when a large trunk is implicated it more often gives rise to inter mediate or secondary hoemorrhage than to severe primary bleeding In fact such evidence as can be obtained points to but few deaths taking place on the field from primary bleeding Although however external haemorrhage is slight interstitial bleeding into the limbs or into the cavities of the trunk during the first few hours after the injury is common and may be severe or fatal As will be remarked later trau matic aneurysms are comparatively frequent Again the scoring or contusion of nerve trunks gives rise to more or less complete paralysis or to severe neuralgic pain during and after the healing of the wound The tendency to run an aseptic course is very marked and deep suppuration or diffuse cellulitis is distinctly rare This depends on the smallness of the wound the aseptic nature of tlle bullet and the fact that foreign bodies such as pieces of clothing are comparatively rarely introduced The asepticity of the bullet is I think clearly demonstrated and is probably due to the fact that the bullet in travelling through the barrel of the rifle obtains a completely fresh surface and with such enters the body As to the frequency with which portions of clothing are carried into the wound it should be remarked that this varies considerably with the nature of the material traversed The opening in the khaki jacket for instance from the hardness of the material is usually a clean slit but if the bullet has to traverse a flannel shirt loss of substance and transference of this to the wound is more common while in the case of the highland kilt where 408 TMLJQBJ7 MILITARY hIOSPITALS IN NATAL F3B 17 1900 several layers of cloth have to be traversed portions are com paratively frequently found in the wounds The slight tendency to suppuration exhibited by the tracks is however I think due to some inherent character of the tissue probably explained by the condensation and surface destruction of the tissue resulting from the force and velocity of the bullet since the tracks neither bleed freely at first nor do they furnish any material amount of serous discharge dur ing the process of healing They remain indeed dry throughout and their slight tendency to suppuration is well instanced by the fact that if for any reason a deep part of a track becomes infected and suppurates the inflammatory pro cess shows no tendency to spread by the original wound but comes to the surface locally During the process of healing the apertures and with them the track gradually contract the aperture of entry is closed by dry clot and diminishes in size the contused margin becom ing a small black depressed spot in the centre while the aperture of exit often closes with an ordinary reddened cica trix When fully healed the ends of the contracted track can be felt as two small indurated spots often so hard as to give the impression of an included foreign body The extreme density of the resulting cicatrix in the deeper paits of the wound is a factor of much importance since if it involves tendons or nerves considerable impairment of movement or signs of nerve pressure are produced Again a track through the muscles of the leg for instance will more or less tie the whole thickness of the traversed structures together from the aperture of entry to that of exit both of which may be seen to be drawn in as dimples when the muscles are put in action This condition naturally gives rise to much subsequent stiffness and pain on movement and forms one of the most troublesome afterconsequences in simple flesh wounds The scars left in the situation of the two aper tures are not more apparent than those resulting from a large acne pustule The above description of uncomplicated flesh wounds shows that the treatment of these injuries is simple in the extreme It has consisted almost entirely in the application of pads of dry bicyanide gauze and a little wool after the parts surrounding the openings have been washed with an antiseptic lotion either a solution of carbolic acid or of perchloride of mercury Fixation beyond that result ing from the bandaging on of the dressing has rarely been needed In the foregoing remarks concerning the aseptic course of the wounds considerable stress has been laid on the aseptic character of the bullet and the nature of the injury to the soft parts but I should not neglect to add that the purity of the atmosphere and the apparently innocuous nature of the dust on the high veld when the camp is a fresh one must also be credited as important factors in the happy results which have been attained up to the present It will be noted that no remark has been made as to the treatment of retained bullets and this for two reasons first retained Mauser bullets are uncommon and secondly if not causing trouble they are best left alone unless they lie in very superficial posi tions Pietermaritzburg January 20th THE MILITARY HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL SHIPS IN NATAL SUSPENSE  HERE in Natal we have been living for some time past in almost daily expectation of hearing of severe fighting up at the front and of a fresh influx of wounded The suspense has been so long however and the scanty amount of news so try ing that already some degree of mental reaction is apparent Today comes the information apparently well authenticated that the relief forces have crossed the Tugela and the long expected engagement cannot now be far distant Nearly all the men wounded at Colenso who have been under treatment in hospital here have been moved away and the hospitals are fairly empty THE HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION IN NATAL The opportunity is therefore a good one for reviewing the hospital accommodation in Natal and considering how far it is adequate to meet an emergency that has long been foreseen GENERAL HOSPITAL AT MooI RIVER No 4 General Hospital is now established at Mooi river distant by rail some two or three hours from this place It is of course a tent hospital similar in all respects to Nos 2 and 3 at Wynberg and Rondebosch near Capetown Fully 500 patients can be accommodated TEE BARRACK HOSPITALS AT PIETERMARITZBURG The main hoapitals in Maritzburg are the barrack buildings at Fort Napier and are two in number containing beds for about 6oo cases At the moment of writing 400 of these beds are empty They are placed on sloping ground well above the town The wards are the usual type of barramk hut with the invariable verandah or  stoep  running along the whole length in the lower aspect Eaeh ward contains about 25 beds rather too large a number Many of the huts are old and have the usual disadvantages of modern buildings that have been in use for some time The floors are hardly perfect and the visitoraccustomed to the glazed bricks the marble and the tiles of modern civilian hospitalswould find much to criticise and perhaps much to be surprised at as regards the eminently satisfactory progress of wounds and operation cases under treatment in them The huts burnt down on January ioth have been rapidly rebuilt and are already nearly complete THE CHURCH AND LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HOSPITALS The garrison church has been cleared and it is intended to use itif necessity arisesas a hospital ward The floor space will allow of 36 to 40 beds This building is lofty and being of brick has the great advantage of being cool a feature of no little value in the treatment of the sick and wounded in a hot climate The temperature in the town for some days past has during the day averaged over 8o0 F But the fact is that a church does not make a very good hospital The church is rather dark and the amount of window quite insufficient Moreover in each light only about onethird of the window can be opened All the patients are unnecessarily congregated in one ward and however continuously the doors are kept open the air is likely to be stagnant in the corners Probably the milder cases especially such as are not confined to bed will be rele gated to the Church Hospital In the centre of the town the fine and lofty building of the Legislative Assembly has been converted into a hospital for the Volunteers and is excellently Euited for the purpose The sole objection that can be urged against it Is that the number of patients in the main ward is too large The liospital fittings are excellent The bedsteads have wirewove mattresses those of the Fort and Lower Barrack Hospitals are of sacking and the whole place has the right stamp of neatness and goodorder upon it Thecolonists of Natal have evidently determined to do the thing thoroughly well and they have succeeded This building is fitted with electric light The church has the same advan tage On the slope of a hill just outside the town overlooking the Park are the tents of the College Hospital similar to the other tent hospitals There is ample space and the number of beds could be almost indefinitely increased but it is to be feared that there would be difficulty in providing a propor tionate increase in the medical and the nursing staff THE SPIRIT OF THE COLONISTS In addition to these hospitals the two ships now at Durban must be reckoned The Lismore Castle furnishes a very re markable instance of the energy of the people of Natal and of the Durban workmen in particular In four days andahalf the vessel was entirely converted from a transportfor troops to a floating hospital The old fittings had to be removed and the entire ship practically rearranged The swing and fixed cots were made and put in place dressers set up and operating theatre constructed between decks the electric lighting altered ventilation arrangements modified and a thousand other minor details considered and completed in this astonish ingly short time Two things were necessary for so successful a piece of work One was an energetic chief with a power of organisation This requisite was more than fully supplied by Captain Holland of the Indian Marine Secondly the men entrusted with the actual work had to set to their task with The War In South AfricaAuthors William ThomsonSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2065 Jul 28 1900 pp 24925320265298 1204

Enteric Fever Pretoria June 2Jth The difficulty of getting through any letter to or from Pretoria suggests that we are in a degree invested by the nemy True he is a good way from us in the south and in the north Botha has been driven off 40 miles after two sharp engagements But De Wet has adopted the course which was obvious  he did not need the prompting of our generous Con tinental friends and has assailed telegraph and railway lines in our rear with some success Letters and telegrams do reach home we believe but only by using messengers to carry them to a place of safety Letters for us however do not come I have had none of later date than April 20th and anxiety is naturally great We believe that somewhere south 1200 mail bags are awaiting safe conveyance to the frontbut rumour now has it that they have been captured and burnt by De Wet Pretoria is full of interest to us all Our entry to it was through suburban brickfields and inches deep of red powder that shaped into clouds at the smallest breath But as we advanced we entered long straight wide roads always running at right angles to each other edged with houses of varying architecture and size Some were pretty houses many elaborate villa residences of red brick and stucco faced and planted by trees among which the fruitladen orange was conspicuous As we neared the central square we entered the limited region of shops Many of them were really immense stores like those at home most of them well fitted and all of them lighted by electricity The square it self is made impressive by the two great buildingsthe Raadzaal or Parliament House facing the new but unoccu pied Palace of Justice They are both worthy of the home metropolis and the Boer officials certainly know how to make offices splendid and luxurious In the middle of the square nd therefore spoiling the effect stands an old Dutch Re formed church but it was purchased by the late Government ior removal At one end of this stands the beautiful pedestal for the Kruger monument the scaffolding still around it but the effigy although finished absent  and already the vacant epace has been assigned to a statue of Her Majesty It is also suggested that Lord Robertss statue should occupy the opposite end Banks and insurance offices or hotels more or less handsome make the sides and give a certain European air to the place Then in the daytime the whirling dust is controlled by watering carts At night the streets blaze with electric lights But the ordinary civil population is absent Many hops are closed altogether but not one is barricaded as they were at Johannesburg Tommy walks abroad unarmed as if he were in a garrison town at home  officers throng into the hotels to get a square meal after a biscuit ration The only Boers to be seen are in the crowd at the Raadzaal where they push in like a mob at an early door to deliver up their rifles and take the oath of neutrality Sometimes this has been varied by fifty or sixty prisoners taken at some fight These do not go free  but for the rest when they have got their pass they join the ordinary street passengers and lose any special identity for us as fighting men Only a week ago they were firing on us  now the bandolier and rifle are put Aside and the Boers are ordinary people fraternising with us discussing the campaign telling their adventures criticising their own Generals and ours but always expressing admira tion of the splendid bravery of the British soldier Such is Pretoria today under a second British occupation Just nineteen years ago when we retired from it the square over which two palaces now hold guard was covered with waving veld grass and the paved pathways were represented by a couple of foot tracks We camped on Wednesday June 6th with the nth Division near the famous racecourse where our prisoners were confined and the next night we knew of the release of about 3000 of them at Waterval Many of them looked ill and worn but their delight at hearing our guns and seeing their old com rades may be imagined Of their hardships in illness and in health they speak openly Stories flit about which may take form later on but it would be unjust to mention names until there is substantial proof of charges On Friday we moved out with the troops for about nine miles and on Saturday re turned to our ground nearer town The ambulances carried back thirty patients and later in the afternoon we received seventy more But the field equipment which we had brought was adapted to fifty only All we could do was to give up six small living tents provided for the company and thus we were able to give cover to the second fifty but these men had to lie on the ground wrapped in blankets Nearly half were enteric cases and it is easy to realise what this meant There was no provision for them in the town The Volks Hospital was full and a model school was already crammed  other hos pitals on the field were as we were except that all their patients had to lie without stretcher and on mattresseswhile we were able to give these small comforts to fifty As always happens once the troops sat down sickness made itself mani fest and there were i 000 cases or more demanding treatment and proper housing The Evolution of the Irish Field Hospital I had looked for some days at the stately exterior of the Palace of Justice and wondered what was inside I learned that it had just been finished at a cost of 18000o but that it had never been occupied A casual conversation with Major the Hon R White led to an introduction to General Maxwell the Military Governor who had visited the place Next day the Pretoria Medical Commission was formed consisting of Mr Murray Guthrie MP Mr Leigh Wood distinguished for his splendid services in helping our sick prisoners at Waterval Mr Heys and Mr Loveday member of the Raad The Governor asked me to act as adviser and to be a member of the Commission of wnich Mr Wood was made chairman We became a local Red Cross Society and by the energy of Mr Wood and Mr Guthrie an enormous quantity of material was collected in twentyfour hours and we at once began to distribute bedding etc to the various hospitals and we took over the Palace on Friday June 15th as a perfectly bare building A hospital committee was formed and I was asked to undertake the medical direction with the usual pro viso as to recognition of military supervision and control a proposal which was at once sanctioned by Lord Roberts Mr Rupert Guinness was also appointed a member On Tuesday June 19th I moved in with 80 patients who were provided with wirewoven beds white sheets and the little luxuries that were so keenly appre ciated by men whose only bed for six months has been the hard veld and whose only tenting was the sky Electric lighting had to be introduced kitchens and latrines con structed and stores laid in It was downright hard work for I had as helpers only Dr Coleman Mr Douglas Thomson dresser Mr Lurring apothecary and five orderlies sur vivors of the march and these with Mr Murray Guthrie and Mr Wood worked with untiring energy To them I owe more thanks than words can convey Today we have 260 patients in the hospital the only addi tion to my staff being some untrained orderlies The greater number of the cases are enteric fever and several of these have died within a few hours of admission They have been in field hospitals under conditions that were inimical to their recovery I The Palace of Justice is a building of fine proportions and would be quite worthy of a place in any metropolis It has a i frontage of about 200 feet and a depth of nearly 250 The central hall is 145 feet by 45 floored with encaustic tiles and I surrounded by a balcony supported by 60 massive stone pillars the bases and cornices of polished metal The central dome is lofty and ornate The sides and front of the building are three storeys high and the rooms number about ico Beneath in the basement there is excellent storage I Four of the principal wards have been named after Lord Roberts the Military Governor General Maxwell Lord Kitchener and Lord Iveaghwhose staff for the Irish Hospital has been for the time domiciled in the Palace of Justice I The difficulty which was the first to be dealt with was the disposal of excreta The method here is to have nightsoil 25Q mSSLSSa CRITICISMS OF MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTSJuly 28 1900 removed by carts and buried I determined to have it burned For this purpose it is mixed with coal ashes and sawdust removed and fed into a furnace so that with a preliminary free treatment with disinfectants the best is done under the circumstances The remainder of my staff at Bloemfontein has been tele graphed for by the CommanderinChief and when it arrives we shall be able to deal with 400 or 500 patients But transit at present is very uncertain Trains are still being fired into and contents blown up An officer whom I met yesterday had been seven days on the journey Today however things look better THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS From otjr Special Correspondent at Capetown July 3rd 1900 The Opening of the Campaign The main topic of interest at present is of course the sweep ing attacks on army medical administration which under the leadership of Mrs Dick Chamberlain have been made on this side concurrently w ith Mr BurdettCouttss campaign in England The first move here was a contributed article from an irregular from one of the Colonies who is stated to be a man of education and of high position in his own country published by the Cape Times far and away the most influential of South African newspapers For this article by not inserting it in the correspondence columns the Cape Times of course assumed a measure of responsibility and it necessarily attracted much attention It evoked a whole shoal of letters nearly all in defence of the department Closely following upon this the Archbishop of Capetown a very highly respected prelate distinguished for the moderation of his views in most matters made a speech at the Good Hope Society roundly accusing the medical authorities not only of general neglect but of keeping back from patients comforts sent by the Society In particular he mentioned the camp at Rosebank where there is some sort of a  hospital  devoid of the simplest comforts and he went so far as to say that tbe medical officer there was unfit for his office The Rev G G McLure a Presbyterian minister substantiated the general charge of neglect and went on to say that what had been said of Rosebank was equally true of Green Point and Maitland Some further complainants have extended the attack to Wynberg and Rondebosch but Wood stock was not specifically mentioned until yesterday when Mrs Dick Chamberlain who is I know the prime organiser of the whole criticism wrote to the Cape Times a very trenchant letter indeed in which she designates both No 1 and Woodstock as dirty and insanitary swarming with filthy insects and  destitute even of necessities except those contributed by the public The same issue con tains a letter signed by 33 convalescents at Rosebank protest ing against the reflections on their medical officer stating that their wants had now been attended to and then going on to state that their real grievance lies in the direction of not being able to get their pay a matter with which the medical world has of course no concern It should be men tioned that the Archbishop has written to Dr Klein the Rosebank Medical Officer apologising unreservedly for his aspersions upon him and that this letter has been published The Archbishop however still maintains that someone has been to blame in connection with Rosebank Two corre spondents write defending Naauwpoort and Deelfontein re spectively and the Cape Times prints a halfhearted subleader admitting that the complaints may represent an exceptional experience but still damning the military medical officer with faint praise by insisting that heroism in the field does not make up for roughness or unsympathetic treatment of patients elsewhere The Allegations Examined Now I purposely abstained from writing to you on this painful subject last week from the fear of being led into an ex firte statement without the opportunity of personal inquiry have now carefully looked into the matter from all sides and shall endeavour to give the result of my conclusions for what they are worth These conclusions are arrived at from the point of view of a civilian medical practitioner holding no brief for the Army Medical Service but who can add to twenty years practice in the Colony the experience of an old campaigner that of an administrator of a civil hospital and that of a correspondent whose duty has brought him into daily contact with the hospitals at the base since the beginning of the war Alleged Deficiencies in Diets Briefly then my humble opinion is that whilst the medical machinery has failed in some places to save the men from dis comfort and perhaps in a few has involved them in a measure of injury the gross allegation of wilful neglect of mala fides and of culpable incompetency can easily be disproved Some of them indeed disprove themselves Take the worst allegation of them all contained in the Colonial Volunteers  Seamy Side article that a sergeant in charge of his field hospital and other orderlies systematically refused to supply actually routine articles of diet without payment at an exorbitant rate and that this was allowed to go on systematically Common sense alone is sufficient utterly to pulverise such a statement as this There were according to the complainant 26 men in the tent To assume that every single man of those 26 was prepared to keep silence under treatment of this kind especially when accentuated by such trifles as the kicking of a patient with dysentery is to assume the absurd Tommy is not given to possessing his soul in peace when he has a grievance and your average free and independent Colonial even less so Complaint is all the easier from the fact that it is of a nature so easily substantiated The diet sheet can be read by every patient so that he knows what he is entitled to and a failure to supply the items therein named is a common grievance to which the whole tent would certify I have invariably found that the soldier scrutinises his diet sheet most carefully and never fails to bring to the notice of his medical officer the slightest discrepancy between it and his supplies But it is alleged that complaint can be stifled by the simple process of a sergeant bending over the bed of a man who is beginning a disclosure to his medical officer and terrorising him into silence by  insulting and obscene  threats This suggestion is grotesque seeing that medical officers RAMC and civi alike have the usual allowance of perceptive faculty Then again as to the stifling of legitimate complaint what becomes of the orderly MO of the camp or garrison orderly officer of the PMO of the chaplain and all the other heterogeneous mass of visitors official and nonofficial P Could none of them listen P The experience of everyone of our civil surgeons is that the slightest defect quantitative and qualitative is promptly brought to the notice of the orderly MO whose special province it is to elicit complaints Further the mens own medical officers are by no means always accompanied by war dm as ter s or orderlies Apart from their ordinary rounds they constantly look into the wards at odd times and on such occasion a private complaint is always possible And there is this further considera tion that by far the major share of the actual attendance upon the sick is in the hands of civil surgeons both at the base and at the front These gentlemen are neither better nor worse than the generality of practitioners  indeed the Volunteer admits that they are  shining lights of the ser vice  if so the service is so permeated by them that its dark ness cannot be so great and they at least are not trammelled by the assumed baleful service traditions of brutality and incompetence Consequently if brutality and neglect are so rampant as we are told the profession as a whole must plead guilty to charges not often levelled against it But are the RAMC officers so easily persuaded to leave behind them the traditions of the most humane of callings  I do not think so The most careful investigation has only brought to my notice one instance of harsh language or action on the part of an officer in that corps during this war This was in defensible I admit but occasional black sheep may be found in any body of men The point of the critics on this side at least is that the whole system is honeycombed with the faults complained of No one can deny that the best of systems has its weak points nor that individual evildoers are found everywhere Unfairness consists in holding up the blaek sheep as types of the flock What I maintain is that the military hospital system with July 28 1900JORITIOIfrMS OF MEDICAL ARRANGEMETgmwouSLi 251 its neverending checks and counterchecks often complained of as wearisome is as perfect a human machine for checking peculation and neglect as one can at present devise Your average civil surgeon complains that it is only too minute At Rosebank Camp Now as to the more specific charges The pity of it is that they are so few The Archbishop had heard this and had been told that but he only nailed ene charge to the counter namely that convalescents at Rosebank had neither had blankets nor beds What are the facts P At Rosebank Camp there is no hospital whatever nor is one intended This camp is the base depot of the South African Irregular Forces suchas the South Africa Light Horse Robertss Horse etc These forcea were in the first in stance raised and equipped by private effort mostly by a few wealthy Johannesburgers A committee of these gentlemen did all the recruiting made all the arrangements and subject of course to the approval of the Imperial military authorities appointed the officers amongst others Dr Klein the present medical officer at the camp a German practitioner well known for his kindliness and ability The committee secured the Agricultural Show ground as a bape depot at which recruits were and are kept until fit for the front Later on of course it received men about to be discharged men temporarily sent down to Capetown with prisoners or the like and men dis charged from hospital pending their rejoining their squadrons or being discharged from them To examine recruits and to attend to medical needs of the depot Dr Klein was kept but it must be distinctly understood that he was merely to render temporary aidas a regimental surgeon every thing beyond the slightest ailment being sent to a general hospital after being examined by him Consequently no hospital accommodation was provided nor needed Except as regards the actual per sonnel of Dr Klein the place did not come apart from sanita tion under the purview of the RAMC at all But quite recently owing mainly to the delay of the pay people at Rosebank in settling with and dissharging the men the number of convalescents has increased and as some of them were still weakly Dr Klein felt that they needed some thing better in the way of bedding than the ordinary trooper fit for service and he repeatedly requisitioned the Command ing Officer of the depot to that effect After a time nothing being done or apparently likely to be done he appealed to his medical chiefs not because they were responsible for the sup plies for they were not but simply to back him up Colonel McJS amara promptly inspected and concurred with Dr Klein in considering beds etc necessary and requested the Com manding Officer to provide them resting satisfied with the ex pectation that this would be done Dr Klein was equally satisfied but the Commanding Officer did nothing and thus the state of things undoubtedly wrong came about and it was only remedied eventually by the Medical Department supply ing the things required clothing and bedding for which it was not responsible Surely it is too much to expect the RAMC to follow men up to their own units and perform the functions of a regimental commissariat Charges of Callousness Then Mr McClure and others have roundly said that the citizens of Capetown are sending waggon loads of comforts for the sick and that the medical officers or someone else pre vent their getting them Mrs Dick Chamberlain is even more emphatic According to her  So determined are the doctors not to allow the outside public so callous are they to the sufferings of the unfortunate patients that men have to lie on the floor and suffer all kinds of things Now again for the facts The PMOs of the hospitals have again and again appealed for various things constantly gratefully acknowledge them to the minutest detail in the papers and what is of the most importance forthwith hand everything received to the Superintendent Nursing Sister who keeps them under lock and key and distributes them entirely at her own discretion subject only of course to the dietetic direction of the medical officers in charge of the cases Surely no one can assert that any better almoners than our devoted nursing sisters could be found  Maitland Yeomanry Gamp  Now as to the charges of neglect at the Maitland Yeomanry Camp The explanation I gave as to the position of Rosebank apply in great measure to this It is not recognised as a hospital or convalescent home In order to meet ordinary everyday requirements and for sanitary purposes the Yf omanry Hospital was asked to detail a medical officer to do duty at the McKenzies Farm Yeomanry Base Camp but it was distinctly ordered by the SurgeonGeneral that every case of illness in the least serious should be sent to a general hospital The SurgeonGeneral has from the begin ning been opposed to small subsidiary hospitals and I think rightly Unfortunately it appears that the medical officer at McKenzies Farm took upon himself to treat some cases of enteric fever there and two died It is certainly not proved that these men died from any neglect  indeed the utmost that an indignant lady critic whom I interviewed on the sub ject could urge was that there was no nursing sister there They were housed in a comfortable hut and received quite as good attention as nine out of ten enteric patients get in civil life but still it is unfortunate that they were dealt with at a place never destined for the purpose but for this the PMO can hardly be held responsible There is a little difficulty in getting at the exact position of the medical officer at McKenziesthat is as to whether the PMO of the Base or the Yeomanry Hospital people are his immediate superiors Of course in the broad sense all medical arrangements are under the SurgeonGeneral but there is no going behind the fact that in the case of all the outside hospitals there is a certain delegation of responsibility to the bodies forming them Indeed if it were not so the benevolent organisers would be the first to kick It is only fair to mention that the Yeomanry people distinctly state that they disclaimed from the first any responsibility for the management of the Maitland Hospital Be this as it may it is rather unfair to expect the military authorities to exercise the same constant supervision over an institution distinctly instructed to regard itself as a mere  detention hospital as over a recognised place for the continuous treatment of the sick This consideration carries still more weight when the institution has some sort of an individuality apart from the military system properly so called for reasons which I have just mentioned I have very good reason to believe that this individuality was at the bottom of the retention of the enteric patients at Maitland Whether the esprit de corps dwelt in the medical officer in charge or in the yeomen patients I am not prepared to say but I do know that from the adjoining cavalry camp at Maitland proper even very slight cases are very promptly despatched to Woodstock or Wynberg Food Supplies Another assertion made by the Volunteer contributor of the Cape Times is that even at Wynberg a man cannot get sufficient food without paying for it that instead of the dietary pound of meat they only get 8 ozsM and that the allowance of butter is absolutely insufficient Now these assertions I am in a position to deny categorically both from my own intimate acquaintance with Wynberg Rondeboscb and Woodstock and from the testimony of several men Colonial friends OLe or two relations of my own who have been in thete institutions and can be relied upon to speak quite unreservedly I am quite certain that the meat supply is absolutely up to weight except on rare occasions which without peculation must happen when large quantities have to be hurriedly divided I know of several instances in which complaints have been made of short weight and in all these cases except one the complaint was shown by actual weighing to be groundless So far from wardmasters or orderlies being inclined to aid and abet the cooks in peculation I have always found that these people are rather inclined to regard one another as natural enemies and that the average ward mast er rejoices in catching the cookhouse people tripping Again as to the butter It must be admitted that in some of the diets the ounce allowed is not quite sufficient but practically whenever asked for an additional ounce very often two come in as extras I have before me notes of 48 diet sheets taken from four wards and an annex without any selection From these I have eliminated 14 cases in which for strictly medical reasons the diet is limited The remaining 34 are on roast varied stewed steak roast chop stewed chicken and minced chicken In every sheet except one either stout whisky cr pert wine appears The War In South

THEttransport Patiahz arrived from Natal yesterday with 87 Boer prisoners of whom about twenty were wounded and were sent on to No I eneral Hiospital at Wynberg The rest went in the usual course to the prison ship Peneloge at Simons Town The wounded men were landed at the Cape town Docks and thence conveyed by train direct to Wynberg Station I have not as yet had an opportunity of examining the injured men but from what I saw of them as they were being landed I should say that none of the injuries are very severe only s were stretcher cases the rest being quite able to walk As in the case of the British wounded to whom I referred last week most of them appeared to be hit in the extremities Two Boer surgeons Drs Sharpe and Marais accompanied them ARRANGEMENTS FOR REMOVAL OF WOUNDED TO WYNBERG HOSPITAL 0 The local centre of the St John Ambulance has got into working order a scheme for affording assistance en route to the sick conveyed from the Docks to the General Hospital At the Docks where the men are entrained it has a trained nurse with three lady assistants and at Wynberg Station where they are detrained for conveyance by ambulance waggon to the hospital a trained nurse with 5 lady assistants A waiting room is provided at each place with a paraffin stove and light refreshments such as bovril milk tea coffee cocoa and a8rated waters with stimulants Lounges and chairs are fixed up in each dep6t and they furnish not only a place where the men can be kept in privacy but the oppor tunity of a little refreshment before the journey is under taken At Wynberg the advantage of this provision is obvious as the hospital is fully a mile distant and the ambulance waggons can only convey about twentyfour each journey so that a number must always have to remain in waiting for a time The bearer detachment of the Association has not yet been made use of hut is ready wheneverrequired Very much more voluntary aid is available but the authori ties have for the present declined it THE GOOD HOPE SOCIETY The Good Hope Society which has been formed for the purpose of providing siek and wounded with extraregulation comforts is meeting with enthusiastic support Mrs Hanbury Williams the chatelaine of Government House being the moving spirit It is supplying such things as flowers literature fruit tobacco and cigarettes easy chairs lounges etc THE SYMPATHY OF THE  BROWN PEOPLE In connection with this a very touching instance of the quiet sympathy of the coloured people ought to be men tioned A largelyattended meeting of coloured men was held at Stellenbosch a very hot Bond centre but where the Brown people are enthusiastically loyal to consider the best way of helping the Imperial authorities and it was decided to forward regularly supplies of strawberries and other fruit to the hospital Stellenbosch is a large fruitproducing centre arid most of the coloured folk have their little gardens No white man was present at the meeting and the action was absolutely spontaneous OFFER OF A HOSPITAL AT STELLENBOSCH The loyal whites held a meeting at the same place and decided to offer theGeneral a hall fully equipped as a hospital with 12 beds and provided with nursing staff Dr Versfeld agreeing to give his services as surgeon All was to be done at the expense of the community Whether this kind offer will be accepted I do not know The village has an evil sanitary reputation so perhaps the SurgeonGeneral will hesitate MEDICAL ATTENDANCE ON THE JOHANNESBBURG RFUGIEES The problem of medical attendance on the Johannesburg refugees has had the attention of the local relief committees As we have now about 20000 of these people in our midst most of them practically penniless there is naturally a good deal of sickness amongst them mostly gastrointestinal diseases and bronchopncnmonia amongst the children Dr Jane Waterston Miss Edith Pellatt LSA and Drs Kitching Fuller Hazell Von Landsberg and DarleyHartley have volunteered their services and are dividing the duty of gratuitously attending the scattered refugees at the six homes and at their lodgings in the city Several chemists have kindly undertaken to do the dispensing at half ordinary rates VACCINATION The Relief Committee is very wisely insisting on every claimant for relief without distinction being vaccinated a very necessary measure as Johannesburg has never been free from smallpox for years and several cases have already been brought down THE PHYSICAL STANDARD FOR ADMISSION TO THE ARMY AT the annual meeting of the British Medical Association held at Portsmouth the following resolutions were passed in the Section of Medicine That the Council be requested to communicate to the War Office that it is the opinion of this Section that the physical examination of candidates for the army should precede the educational That the Council be requested to communicate to i he War Office that It is the opinion of this Section that soldiers ought not to serve in the tropics before the age of twentytwo 22 That the physical standard for admission to the public services requires

WYNBERG SINCE my last letter wounded and sick have been steadily coming in As I mentioned No I General is practically full up No 2 has 262 patients to date The medical patients are still few as compared with the surgical but a few cases of dysentery and rheumatism are coming in Happily the RAMC is proving quite equal to the strain and every detail is being splendidly carried out Most commendable of all is the promptitude with which despite the difficulty of a single line of railway taxed to the utmost for other purposes the wounded are brought down to the base The field arrange ments are reported to me as being all that can be desired In view however of the certain prospect of an enormous accession of wounded from Lord Methuens column the per sonne is certain to be overworked and to partially provide for this the Principal Medical Officer at the base is calling for a number of recruits for the Cape Medical Staff Corps which is acting as an auxiliary to the RAMC Plenty of men are available who know something about first aid and stretcher drill but I doubt if more than a mere handful with any ward training can be obtained However the men offering are mostly intelligent and may be of some use in a few weeks No 2 Gneral Hospital No 2 General Hospital is now in full working order It is established on a gentle sandy slope very near No x the site being suitable in every way The hospital consists en tirely of marquees of the ordinary pattern Wooden floors are being laid for all the tents although a few of the first pitched had to be put up without them owing to lack of time As occasion offers however this deficiency will be remedied The erection of an operating room has been commenced in the meantime a marquee is being used Every provision is made for the comfort of the patients and I am quite prepared to find that the results may be even better there than in the permanent No I THE SANITARY ARRANGEWMENTS The hygienic arrangements are excellent Colonel Duke the Principal Medical Officer in charge is certainly an en thusiast in sanitary matters and has left no stone unturned in this respect There are no drains in the camp except one from the kitchen all liquid refuse being conveyed by hand cart tanks to absorption pits well below the camp All solid refuse such as medical dressings and the like are burnt on a site adjoining the absorption pits These latter act well in this sandy soil The contents disappear pretty rapidly and the surface is s kimmed daily or oftener Into the absorp tion pits refuse from the kitchen is conveyed by a short drain This drain also collects from a wellarranged and I should say very useful scullery behind the kitchen but re served entirely for washing cups plates and other utensils from the wards This scullery has a double row of zinc sinks flushed from hot and cold water taps led on from the kitchen This struck me as being a very useful adjunct to the hospital The latrines are to the upper side of the camp and are airy and well arranged The contents of the feces and urine tubs are removed nightly to the town depositing pits some miles away The latrines are furnished with a tap and sunk stone sink for washing tubs soiled with dysenteric or enteric exereta PROGRESS OF THEM WOUNDED The class of case in No 2 does not differ materially from No i although there is a large proportion of perforating abdominal wounds9 are in at present Curiously enough most of them have done well under expectant treatment a result at variance with most past experience Colonel Duke attributes this to the fact that most of the men sustained their injuries whilst fasting and thinks that the punctures inflicted on hollow viscera close up under these circum stances before extravasation can take place Five spinal cases are in the hospital with complete paraplegia Lamin eotomy has been performed on onejwithout reuibl The per forating chest wounds have done well almost uniformly Onecase I saw was interesting A Mauser bullet had enterec just to the right of the thyroid cartilage and emerged slightly to the right of the ligamentum nuchee an inch belowthe occipital protuberance No symptoms followed In anothier case a Mauser bullet had entered the malar bone on one side and emerged in the temporal region on the other The result has been anosmia and diplopia but no loss of visual acuity This hospital is just now short of thirty of its noncommhs sioned officers and rank and file personnel but being only par tially occupied the loss is not much felt The men were sent on to Natal directly they arrived In two or three days we may however expect that the casualties from Magersfonteii will fill up the place Whatever may happen in future everything is working smoothly now The Australian combined Field Hospital and Bearer Com pany is still here Other General Hlospitals No 3 General Hospital is being very rapidly erected under the energetic supervision of Colonel Supple and should be ready early next week No 4 has arrived but its location has notyet been fixed THE AMBULANCE TRAINS One of the ambulance trains is still being worked under RAMC officer and noncoms by a crew of St John men and I understand they are giving every satisfaction VOLUNTARY AMBULANCE AID Under the guiding hand of Colonel Young the chaos of voluntary help has assumed order on this side He has very wisely proceeded on the plan of doing nothing until he had arranged machinery capable of almost indefinite expansion As I mentioned before he has an office in the Bouses of Parliament and a store in the basement of the same building Mr Nethersole the Secretary of the Good Hope Society shares the office and works in conjunction with Colonel Young A lady of the Working Committee of the Society with three friends attendsdaily These ladies on Colonei Youngs instructions make purchases of comforts assist in clerical work sort out material and the like Just after the arrival of last mail I saw in the office a mass of mail bags directed after the postal manner to the various general and station hospitals in South Africa These contained the news papers sent out by the Red Cross sorted into sets by the ladies a very useful instance of the work they do The comforts supplied to the various hospitals are of the most varied characterfruit vegetables jellies pastry fans couches chairs mosquito nets games tobacco clothing and I know not what besides Many are of course sent direct by donors but Colonel Young is about to arrange a dep8t at Wynberg where an agent will receive donations and appor tion them between the two general hospitals at the base Hitherto nearly everything has gone to No i The Lines ot Communication With reference to the hospitals on the lines of communica tion Colonel Young in a journey from which he returned last week inaugurated a most excellent system the main feature of which is that everything is personally delivered Colonel Young has engaged Mr H E Abbott Assistant Secretary of the St John Centre as travelling agent This gentleman travels in the same train with all consignments and wires the approximate time of his arrival to the officer in charge of each hospital That officer then accredits some one to receive the consignment This course has been found necessary owing to the great risk under the present condi tions of railway pressure of consignments never reaching their destination At several stations small local committees supply the wounded in transit with comforts the material for which is generally sent up from here and cooked on the spot These committees also do some work at station hospitals where such exist One of the most useful things Colonel Young has arranged for is the supply of vegetables to the station hospitals on the lines These articles whilst plentiful enough in Capetown are practically unobtainable upcountry Another very useful gift has been that of 750 suits of pyjamas sent to the Orange River Hospital the advanced statiqn  This howitgl is we understand

surgical appliances at No 2 General Gifts from the Coloured People A very touching gilft made to the wounded was a sum of money contributed by the coloured lepers on Robben Island This move was entirely spontaneous The Coloured Peoples Political Union continue sending in large supplies of fruit vegetables and the like from Worcester and other districts round Capetown THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAM CAMPAIGNER VII CASUALTIES THE total casualties in South Africa up to December 28th are given as follows Killed Wounded Missing Total Officers   82 258 98 438 Men 886 3266 2223 6735 968 3524 2321 6813 This gives I to 36 as the proportion of killed to wounded which is higher than that originally returned as the result of Lord Methuens engagements nevertheless looking to the fact that the campaign in South Africa has been in active progress since October that large numbers of troops have been employed on both sides and that many engagements have occurred these losses as compared with the losses in European c3mpaigns are not heavy The following figures from Sir Thomas Longmores table are given by Stevenson in his Wound8 in War in the

instances the losses in a single decisive battle as for instance at Waterloo and Inkermann were higher than those sus tained during the whole length of a campaign From the methods of fighting adopted by the Boers it is improbable that any conflicts involving the great losses of such battles as those referred to will occur The veld is wide and the Boer invariably prefers a retirement and the trial of a new position to facing at all serious losses on his own side The great majority of assaults on positions have been made by the British troops against the Boers Whenever the Boers have attempted similar assaults upon the English whether at Mafeking or Ladysmith their losses have been as great if not greater than ours under the same conditions CLIMATE AND CLOTHING I pointed out in my last article that the summer was well advanced in South Africa and a correspondent has written to inquire as to the relation of the summer to the rainy season as many of the telegrams speak of the rainy season in Natal as being about to begin The fact is the rainy season is the summer season in Natal and already as the letters of many war correspondents show heavy rains have fallen for some two months past in that country The seasons in South Africa may be divided into summer and winter spring and autumn scarcely existing The summer lasts from October to March the winter from April to September At Capetown and on the Cape Peninsula the rainfall is heavier during the winter months but throughout the rest of South Africa in the coast towns to the eastward as well as on the mountains encircling the interior plateau and on the plateau itself the rain falls chiefly or almost entirely during the summer months The amount varies considerably with the district As pointed out in Dr Hilliers article on The Geography and Climate of South Africa in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of December 2nd I899 the country for meteorological purposes may be divided into i coast terraces 2 the mountains and 3 the plains of the interior Thus to take one of the coast towns at Port Elizabeth the annual rainfall is about 22 inches and falls on 49 days of the year On the coast ter races in such towns as Grahamstown Estcourt and Maritz burg the rainfall is as high as 2959 inches and occurs on some 77 days in the year On the mountains themselves such as the Hogsback the Stormberg in the Cape Colony and the Drakensberg in Natal north of Ladysmith the rainfall reaches as high as 40 inches and falls on 9 days On the interior plateau the rainfall is much less Thus at Beaufort West in the Karroo Cape Colony during the years I89596 the average rainfall was only 97 inches and the number of days of the year on which rain fell was 27 Still further up on the borders of the German territory the rainfall was only 120 inch during the course of the year and fell on 2 days It will thus be seen that the rainfall varies considerably throughout the different districts But wherever it falls it comes down usually in heavy storms during conlpsratively short periods of time drenching thunderstorms being a oommon form of rainfall The question then of what cloth ing may be required varies somewhat with the locality in which the soldier going to South Africa is likely to be engaged Thus in Natal the rainfall is referred to in several of the letters sent home We read in an extract from a letter of an officer writing from Estcourt on Nolvember igth 1899 and published in the Times The weather is most uncertain We have had several miserable days of a continuous drizzle with cold wind and then today is a ripping day My kit of 35 lb was very well chosen for a beginner I have a thick sweater which is a godsend as I carry it in my haversack and put it on at night when sleeping out For a period of some hours and sometimes for a day or two after rain even in the summer months the cold is distinctly felt The rapid evaporation which occurs in the normally dry atmosphere after the earth is saturated with rain largely accounts for this cooling process and under these conditions the campaigner sleeping in a canvas tent will find the protec tion of a sweater and warm clothing especially for sleeping in invaluable The woollen nightcap must always be available for use after the rains in the summer and for continuous use through the winter On the plains of the high veld which are now the scene of Lord Methuens operations south of Kim berley and indeed throughout the grass plains extending over the Free State and southern Transvaal the rainfall as has already been pointed out is considerably less and occurs on rare occasions and although the cooling effect of a storm is felt here it is not felt to any such marked extent as on the coast terraces At the present time the heat suffered by our troops on these plains is by far the most trying feature of the climate thus Mr Makins in his letter published in the JOURNAL last week speaks of the temperature in some of the canvas tents being as high as II5 F The question of what clothing will be required will there J 6 1900

invariably recommended tiat at least one of the regulation suits should be of khaki coloured serge and not of cotton khaki itself Cotton khaki is a splendid material for the sunshine and dust of the average summer day in the field on the plains but is not a good material to get wet in During wet weather the serge would be much safer and more comfortable flannel shirts brown leather boots khaki puttees with cashmere socks are the best articles for everyday wear It is as well to have no hooks on the boots as they are very apt to get broken or to t in the way when preAsed against the stirrup in riding ILiding breeches are better made of worsted cord THE COMMISSARIAT In spite of the fact that the troops at Chieveley Esteourt and on the Modder River are in touch with the railway a certain amount of occasional hardship does appear by the letters from the correspondents to have been endured by our troops in reference to commissariat This we may believe has been temporary and accidental but in view of the tre mendous lengLh of our lines of communication and the de pendence of our soldiers on supplies from the bases it is in teresting to learn from the Times that a feature in connection with the provision of supplies is found in portable rations Each 2OZ tin although only 2 in in height and Ii in across contains all the needful ingredients for I pint of most nutritious soup with the ad dition only of that quantity of hot water salt pepper and all the needful seasoning being included in the tin In the absence of other provisions the soup thus made is sufficient for a meal or at least to keep a man going until he can obtain a more solid repast With his food in this consoli dated form a soldier can carry about with him rations enough to last him if needs be for four or five days a mule can carry I500 tins a camei over 2000 and a Cape wagon will hold about 6oooo In addition to the orders which are being executed for the Government large quantities alike of consolidated soups and of desiccated vegetables are being sent out for the canteens of various regiments SIR JAMES SIVEWRIGHTs AMBULANCE Through the Exchange Telegraph Company we were informed on December 2ISt that Mr Kruger had declined Sir James Sivewrights offer of an ambulance for the use of the Boers on the ground that he does not receive such gifts from an enemy Sir James Sivewright is we confess a somewhat difficult person to understand Is it that his heart is too large or that he believes a fence the most comfortable of seats  He is an exColonial Minister in the Cape Government he is a mem ber of the Afrikander Bond he has offered an ambulance party to Mr Kruger for attendance upon wounded Boers and he has offered certain farmhouses in the vicinity of Capetown to the Imperial authorities for the accommodation of wounded Imperial officets This last offer has been declined The course of the ambulance party since its departure from Aberdeen has been by no means smooth Many of the gentlemen attached to this ambulance are the sons of South African Boers whose sympathies in so far as they have any political colour are probably more with the Boers than with our men in the present conflict On the arrival of the ambu lance in South Africa we are told that it was refused permis sion to go through our lines and thus overland to Pretoria and now unkindest cut of all Mr Kruger says he does not receive such gifts from an enemy That Sir James Sivewright should be accused of being anyones enemy will we are sure hurt him acttely What has happened to the members of the ambulance since Mr Krugers refusal it is somewhat difficult to gather but it has been stated that disappointed Dutch medicos have now in their individual capacity offered their services to the Transvaal It is quite possible that if these offers have been made they will finally be accepted by Mr Kruger on the explicit understanding that these gentlemen are willing to take up arms on behalf of the Transvaal Should this eventuality arise Sir James Sivewright will have been placed in an unenviable position MILITARY HoSPITAL CCOMM1OATION AT CAPETOWN The Tiimes correspondent of December 23rd states that complaints have been freely made for some time past about the military hospital accommodation at Capetown This in no way affects the admirable surgical skill or the care of the medical officers but there is a want of organisa tion and foresight in the arrangements and an absence of those minor comforts which are necessarily dispensed with at the front but are easily procurable at Oapetown The whole establishment of the permanent hospitals was calcu lated on too small a scale at the beginning and has never been completely recast since while the standard of comfort especially for officers is too low This telegram which is continued in the same strain at some length is not of a satisfactory character but we have little doubt that the minor defects unavoidable in the hastilyarranged hospital on which the demands have exceeded anticipation will promptly be remedied The Army Medical Department have to our knowledge engaged a certain number of experi enced civilian surgeons in South africa and among the refugees from Johannesburg alone are many capable men whose services might be enlisted by the department should further occasion for such additional aid arise WOUNDED AND SICK AT WOOLWICH All the wounded and invalids admitted to the Herbert Hospital Woolwich on January 2nd from the steamer Garth Castle had wonderfully improved by the voyage home from South Africa The cases with four ex ceptions had become convalescent and are asking to be sent back to duty The wounds of all those ad mitted to the surgical division have closed and the majority are fit for duty whilst the gunshot injuries to bones and joints are comparatively trivial and all likely under further treatment shortly to recover the free use of their limbs Photographs are being taken by the Roentgen rays of the wounds and injuries to joints and bones of the men who have last arrived from South Africa The choice of foods is varied and all praise the attention shown to them not only during the voyage home but since their arrival at Woolwich by the military medical authorities at the Herbert Hospital At a time when every available bed in the home hospitals is likely to be required it will probably be thought well to send invalids incapacitated and unfit for further duty to their homes or to convalescent institutes as soon as it is possible for them to pass the Board and to leave hospital The numerous offers of convalescent accommodation now being made may therefore not improbably soon be taken up A BASE HOSPITAL FOR THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY The Princess of Wales has become President of a Com mittee of ladies formed to raise a fund of 430000 to establish a base hospital for the Imperial Yeomanry at Capetown It is proposed that ambulance and stretcher bearers should also be provided The scheme for providing medical aid for the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa will have to be carefully thought out and in any case it is clear that it must be of such  nature as to work easily with the existing medical arrange ments for the regular army upon which in fact it must be 3rafted TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMBNTS At Aldershot orders were received on December 2gth by the RAMC or the two bearer companies and two field hospitals to be in readiness to mbark on January 4th and one field hospital and divisional medical 5taff on the gth This puts a heavy strain on the executive a number of nenfor these units had not joined last week A number of civilian com pounders have joined the EAMC at Aldershot where they will undergo 3reliminary drill They are all certificated and will be sent to South kfrica at an early date They have joined the corps under

the superior advantages of this longestablished cot may be described  it consists of a flat wood frame of some 7 ft in length and i ft in width  the frame is secured in canvas which forms the bottom sides and ends  the latter above the cot proper are brought up to an apex with suitable arrangements for slinging it to hooks on board ship or to a ridge pole for hoisting it in or out of a ship  by the Arm wooden frame it can be hand carried  the patient if necessary can be laced into it by the canvas sides  it would apparently be impossible to improve on it for the transport of helpless patients and we have known of it being extremely valuable if not indispensable in removing a critical case from her bed at her residence to a mail steamer at a foreign port the naval seamen and midshipmen in charge proving themselves perfect bearers in that case The Royal Naval Ambulance Steam Launch Cotemporary with the provision of a royal naval ambulance railway carriage the naval authorities have established at Portsmouth two ambulance steam launches for the transfer of naval sick cot cases and the more ablebodied from ships and transports at Spithead as well as from the harbour ships at Portsmouth to Haslar Hospital situated near a creek leading out of Portsmouth Harbour and where a pontoon landing place is provided with a covered way leading to the railway or tram carriage fitted to transport these cots and more able bodied sick to that hospital distant about aquarter of a mile from this landing This ambulance twinscrew steam launch was designed under the late naval medical administration the arrange ments were arrived at by the medical authorities at Haslar and the constructors department Portsmouth Dockyard who have achieved a longdesired reform in this matter Previously each ship sent its sick including cot cases to hospital in their own steam launches or larger boats with no special provision for the purpose  this entailed a large expen diture of labour and but little comfort to the sick Now by the provision of two of these ambulance twinscrew steam launches the sick can be collected from all ships at suitable hours and time of tide and conveyed in comfort to Haslar These ambulance launches work on alternate days and thus secure a continuous system of efficiency The arrangement on board the ambulance steam launches will be readily seen from the sketches given Figs 2 and 3 They are 72 feet in length and have 15 feet beam amidship with a draught of about 3 feet Owing to a comparatively flat bottom they roll somewhat in a seaway or in the wash of steamers in the harbour  their length entails great care in piloting them up Haslar Creek which might be advan tageously dredged to render the hospital more accessible by the launches at all states of the tide  In the fore part of the launch on battened shelving is  accommodation for 12 naval cots in two tiers  the after cot 1 spaces can be screened on if necessary from the foremost  ones  the shelves are provided with steadying brass  lugs i but the spring framerests for the cots are not provided as in the  railway ambulance carriage  these would be a desirable fitting i The cot compartment is reached by a broad staircase with  hooded covering  lockers are placed on the sides of the boat 1 at the foot of the staircase and outside the sliding double 1 doors enclosing the cot space Abaft this cot compartment is the engine room and the twin screw propellers and in c the stern sheets space is found for seats for the more able t bodied patients and the patients effects bags chests etc I The cot compartment has two raised skylights overhead fore s and aft of it for ventilation with candle lamps on the sides t for artificial light when requisite c Eighty thousand dollars have recently been given for the I purpose of building a new laboratory of physiology and r anatomy in Cornell university

this town after the series of vic tories by Lord Roberts were half starved and the horses were mere shadows Before anything could be done in further operations it was necessary to get up food and general sup lies and what it meant to feed 50000 men along a single ine of rail 750 miles from the base may easily be imagined At last orders came for our section under Dr Stoker to re turn to De Aar and that the portion with myself should march to Norvals Pont and having joined there proceed by road to Bloemfontein The tents and some of our baggage were con veyed by train and this party and myself reached Bloemfon tein on the morning of April 1 ith The rest of the corps with the exception of two orderlies with a waggon still de tained in the Prieska district arrived on April 21st after a trying march Colonel Stevenson the PMO assigned us a very pleasant camping ground on the slope of the principal hill which over looks the town and in a short time we were able to take in patients A large number of these were suffering from enteric fever and some were wounded These unfortunate fellows had been lying on the giound in field hospitals and had had long distances to travel Two of them were insensible when they arrived and in spite of all the care we could give never rallied For others the evil day was only postponed and in the first week we lost eight men Later on other consign ments arrived Some of the wounded had been two days in bullock waggons with but little to eat yet bearing their distresses with characteristic bravery On the afternoon of May 2nd a convoy of wounded arrived in bullock waggons after a march of fortyeight hours in charge of Dr Enfeelbach civil surgeon They were men of the 12th Lancers and other cavalry regiments who had been surprised while watering horses after a days engagement While they were clumped together in the water some guns including a VickersMaxim were turned on by the Boers with serious results One man a sergeant of the 12th Lancers was struck on the right side of the head by a pompom shell It carried away a large portion of the parietal bone and brain substance was freely oozing out He was quite insensible  the wonder was that he lived so long An exploration with the finger discovered a cavity about the size of an egg and lying near the petrous portion of the temporal a large frag ment of bone He lived until next day It was then found that the vault was extensively fractured and that it was only held in position by the scalp Wounds of the Knee A fine young fellow of the same regiment was struck in the very centre of the popliteal space by a fragment of shell Dr Engelbach said the haemorrhage was so severe that he thought ihe artery had been ruptured He had securely bandaged the part and controlled the vessel with a tourniquet On exposing ihe parts I found an extensive penetrating wound occupying he popliteal space and a large fragment of shell embedded n the soft parts anteriorly The finger passed easily in from ehind and I then found fracture of the head of the tibia the nner condyle broken off obliquely into the shaft and general lisorganisation I accordingly amputated the limb One of he large venae comits was open for about an inch The artery tad escaped but was thrombosed I have had two cases of gunshot wound of the kneejoint ne by a Mauser bullet one by a MartiniHenry In the first he bullet entered below the base of the inner condyle and assed outwards and upwards There was much effusion ttended by starting pains A radiograph by Dr Friel showed hat a large oval fragment about 3 inches long had been raised ff the lower end of the shaft There was a little fever but he wounds healed without suppuration and the patient has een sent to the Cape In the second case the bullet was emoved on the field by cutting down at the inner margin of tie patella and a little below The MartiniHenry bullet has

is some fever but in spite of the severe wound I hope the case will do well Wonderful Escapes There are other cases of bullet wound of the limbs and thorax which are proceeding satisfactorily Of the curiosities which one meets here I may mention two Just a week ago a man of the ioth Hussars was shot through the nose The bullet entered the left ala just above the margin passed through the septum and out through the right ala No dress ing was required after the fourth day and the wounds are represented by two small upright lines A sergeant of the 12th Lancers was badly contused over the inner condyle of the left humrus A pompom shell entered his haversack behind traversed his notebooks and letters and escaped in front He had some extravasation of blood about the elbow and tingling along the ulnar nerve but he was otherwise unharmed Another man was knocked off his horse by a glancing blow of a  pompom  on the right side just above the zygomatic arch Beyond an abrasion and much headache he is very well The Hospitals in Bloemfontein The stress and consequent exhaustion of the weeks of marching and fighting which culminated in the occupation of Bloemfontein have told their tale Today there are between 3000 and 4000 sick in this town and of these 1200 are enteric cases This gives an idea of the amount of work to be done The military general hospitals 8 9 and 10 are crowded No 9 has already 1500 patients Several of the public build ingsthe Raandzaal Grey College and othersare utilised for the accommodation of the sick and in addition there are the Irish Hospital the Portland and the Langman They are by no means too numerous indeed they are not by any means sufficient to relieve the strain and one only hopes that the cooler weather and the rest which the troops have had may help to lessen the streams of sick which flow daily into the town The Ambulances of the Irish Hospital The waggon equipment of the Irish Hospital fifteen ambul ances has been found of inestimable advantage to the local medical authorities No other hospital here except the Australian is supplied with such means of transport We have carried hundreds of sick and wounded for the various hospitals which have no efficient means of conveyance THE SPECIAL HOSPITALS Imperial Yeomanry Hospital We learn from Mr Alfred Fripp that the site at Deelfontein proves on further acquaintance to be very well adapted for the purposes of the hospital In the middle of April it contained 550 beds and it was the intention shortly to raise it to 750  this would be rendered possible owing to SurgeonGeneral Wilson having sent fifteen extra tents In consequence of the great number of cases of enteric fever at Bloemfontein numbering close upon 2000 all surgical cases were then being sent as soon as possible to the various hospitals south of the Orange River  some went to the Scottish Hospital at Norvals Pont others to the General Hospital at Naauwpoort others to the Stationary Hospital at De Aar which had 300 beds and a considerable portion went to Deelfontein The air of the place was beneficial to the wounded who as a rule soon learnt to do justice to the products of the French cook who Eroduced admirable dishes from unpromising material The ospital also contained many cases of enteric fever but the proportion was tending to diminish The detachments from the St John Ambulance and the London Fire Brigade had worked well both in establishing the hospital and in tending the sick The Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital under Major Ston ham spent some hours at Deelfontein before resuming the journey northward and the staff were in hopes that it would be in time to be included in Lord Robertas advance The Langman Hospital By the request of the Principal Medical Officer at Bloem fontein the Langman Hospital of 100 beds has been con verted into one of 150 the necessary equipment for which has been provided by Mr Langman and despatched to South Africa The medical staff has been increased by the appoint ment of Mr W W Woolliscroft MRCS late HouseSur geon to Charing Cross Hospital WITH THE NATAL FIELD FORCE From an Occasional Correspondent Since the relief of Lady smith the troops have been encamped at strategetical points along the Natal Government Railway including Colenso Ladysmith Modder Spruit and Elands laagte Most of the troops which formed the Ladysmith garrison are at present at Modder Spruit and the men are rapidly regaining health and strength The rainy season in Natal is now over and the weather and climate are all that could be desired The days are bright and pleasantly warm the nights cool and refreshing Dysentery is still very pre valent amongst the troops but simplecontinued and enterie fevers are rapidly diminishing Rations A greater variety in rations is now possible For the time being tinned provisions are no longer in use Fresh beef of mutton is issued daily and vegetables are obtainable in fair quantities Fruit consisting of delicious oranges and pine apples can be purchased in practically unlimited quantities The only alcoholic drink obtainable by the men at present is beer manufactured by the Natal Brewery Company Most of the units in Natal have arranged for a supply of this but the daily issue is wisely limited to 2 pints a man British Red Cross Society This Society has now started a branch in Ladysmith and I doing excellent work The officials there as elsewhere are eminently obliging and are always glad to see officers of any branch of the service at their office They have large supplies of warm underclothing and medical comforts on which officers in command of units are allowed to draw to an almost un limited extent Field Hospitals In one of his interesting letters from Chieveley published in the British Medical Journal for March 24th 1900 Mr Frederick Trves FRCS describes a visit to one of the field hospitalshospitals whose officers have as Mr Trves justly observes the heaviest duties the greatest share of hardships and I am afraid the least credit for their splendid work A brief description of the personnel and work of a field hospital will no doubt interest your readers The per sonnel consists of 4 medical officers a quartermaster and 35 noncommissioned officers and men Each hospital left England with this establishment complete Since taking the field however numerous casualties have occurred amongst both officers and men until at the present moment many of the field hospitals are working with little more than half their original establishments Each hospital is equipped with its own transport medical and surgical panniers and tents calculated for 100 patients In sudden emergencies however some at least of the field hospitals have treated as many as 300 sick and wounded at a time during the present campaign obtaining additional tents from the regiments of the brigade to accommodate them Under ordinary circumstances a field hospital has 40 tents  one square operating and 39 circular tents  25 of there are for the accommodation of sick the remainder are occupied by the personnel surgery office packstore etc The hospital is pitched on a regulation plan with mathematical accuracy the space occupied being 70 yards by 160 yards Afield hospital is essentially a mobile unit as it must accompany its brigade wherever and whenever it moves When a march is ordered the hospital tents must be struck and they and the equipment packed on the waggons by the hour appointed The personnel and waggons then move off immediately in rear of the troops and in front of the brigade baggage waggons On completing the march of say ten to fifteen miles or sometimes more the men have to mark out a new camp on carefullyselected ground to unpack the equipment to pitch the tents and to dig kitchens ashpits I and latrines The officers and men have then to commence 137 iSSLBKSS4j THE ACTION AT TALANA HILTJukb j 190a their duties of attending to the sick and wounded Leisure is an unknown luxury to them and the weekly or biweekly holiday enjoyed by other branches of the service is only known to them by name If an action is in progress there may be a sudden and large influx of wounded As each wounded man reaches the hospital he is examined  his name with full particulars is entered in the Admission and Dis charge Book and in addition on the u Return of Wounded  and on the latter his wound is classified according to its degree of severity its locality and the projectile which caused it Operations of emergency such as removal of bullets ligature of bleeding vessels or amputation of badly shattred limbs are performed The wound is then dressed antiseptically and the patient is ordered whatever nourish ment and extras are considered suitable to his case The officers 01 the field hospitals are also responsible for the selection of cases for transfer to the base and have to be careful to exclude all cases which are unfit to travel When a large number are pouring into the hospitals this is no light duty They also have to prepare the hundred and one re turns which are required in the field and must be ready at ail times to answer queries about the wounded If the action is severe or prolonged they have to snatch food and sleep as best they can the latter probably lying on the ground in clothes and boots which may not have been changed for days From this it will be seen that Mr Trevess reference to  the heaviest duties the greatest share of hardships is fully justified Let us hope however that the latter part of his sentence about the  least credit will not be justified in the present instance The officers of the field hospitals have worked with the utmost courage skill and devotion and they certainly merit a due share of any rewards which may be distributed Their work is apt to be overlooked as it is not done in the public view It is however of the first im pt tance and the splendid results obtained in the stationary and general hospitals during the present campaign would have been impossible were it not for the care with which the field hospitals have carried out their important duties The work of a medical officer on field service is no doubt arduous and the life is not devoid of hardships Taking the rough with the smooth however campaigning in South Africa is full of variety interest and excitement which cannot be quailed under any other conditions whilst the experience gained is quite unique The Fifth and Sixth Brigade Field Hospitals which were unavoidably left in Natal when their brigades proceeded to join Lord Robertas forces in the Orange Free State have now been ordered to rejoin their original brigades much to the delight of all concerned The Victoria Cross The announcement that the Victoria Cross had been con ferred on Major W Babtie CMG for his heroism at the battle of Colenso which reached Ladysmith on April 22nd was received with universal satisfaction In his capacity of Secretary to the PMO Major Babtie has endeared himself to every officer of the corps in Natal It is rumoured that at least two other medical officers with the Natal Field Force have been recommended for this coveted distinction for conspicuous bravery during the attack on Pieters Hill namely Captain J H Campbell and Lieutenant E T Inkson The case of Captain Campbell has already been referred to Lieutenant Inkson has in reality earned the Cross on at least three different occasions At the battle of Colenso he was in medical charge of the Royal Artillery and was conspicuous for his disregard of danger and for the cool ness and constancy with which he exposed himself to the hottest fire whilst collecting and dressing the wounded H was then transferred to the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and with them was present at each of the subsequent battles At the battle of Spion Kop he dressed the wounded for five consecutive days under the hottest fire from the Boer trenches At the attack on Pieters Hill he was in charge of the Inniskilling Fusiliers and dressed the wounded where ever they fell Finally he was left alone in an advanced position with a wounded field officer He brought the officer back unaided under a murderous fire from the Boer trenches THE ACTION AT TALANA HILL DUNDEE We are indebted to Major J F Donegan RAMC Officer Commanding No 18 British Field Hospital for some notes on the wounds and injuries treated in that hospital after the action on October 20th 1899 The total number of wounded was 105  of these 6 were dangerous including 1 officer 79 severe including 13 officers and 3 hospital bearers and 20 were slight Of the slight wounds all had completely healed by October 23rd By October 30th 30 of 79 seriously wounded men were available for duty their wounds being either healed or in the stage of granulation Up to the date of leaving Dundee November 3rd 5 patients had died and 1 case likely to die a wound of spine was left behind unfit to travel The fatal cases were wounds of stomach and intestines vault of skull and brain and a severe wound of lung They unfor tunately included MajorGeneral Sir William Penn Symons KCB who died on October 23rd while the hospital was in the hands of the Boers Throughout there was only one case where pus formed in the locality of wounds  a severe wound of the leg with splin tering of bone When the hospital moved only four cases were left behind as unfit to travel one officer wounded in three places the case of spine and leg wound re ferred to and also a wound through the hipjoint They were progressing most favourably with the exception of the spine case which was considered mortal from the first One officer was wounded by three distinct bullets 1 officer and 18 men were wounded twice with different bullets there being an interval of time between the injuries in some cases or when the first wound was not in his own estimation suffi ciently severe to prevent the man doing his duty This is an instance of the bravery and determination of the British officer and soldier in the attack on Talana Hill One man wounded through the lung and liver with unmis takable symptoms was able to sit up in bed ten days after injury and on arrival at Ladysmith on November 4th 1899 he had almost recovered Two men were shot through the neck the bullet entering the mouth and injuring the soft palate and tongue They suffered exceedingly for some days but eventually re covered Three cases of penetration of the kneejoint did excellently recovering without a rise of temperature In two of these three stiff joints will undoubtedly result but even this is satisfactory when compared with wounds of this locality in the NorthWest Frontier campaign where there was hardly a recovery on record the injury requiring amputation in almost all cases In 16 cases the bullets were lodged in the tissues  14 of these were removed  2 were left in situ one in the lung ap peared to do no harm and the other situated deep in the muscles of the buttock could not be located without rray examination  only one amputation was performedremoval of fingers Major Donegan attributes the favourable results to the following causes  1 To the Mauser bullet itself which is a merciful pro jectile at long ranges only followed by fatal results in the case of injury to large arteries vital organs and intestines 2 To the bullet being nickelcoated and therefore aseptic 3 To its tendency being more to penetrate than to smash and destroy tissues at long ranges 4 To the manner in which the wounded were dressed and attended to in the field and also to their rapid removal to shelter This necessitated the Indian bearers working under tolerably heavy fire but under the supervision of officers warrant officers British noncommissioned officers and men attached to hospital they carried out their duties in the most satisfactory manner and by availing themselves of all cover escaped with only 3  casualties At this date no wheeled transport had been supplied on this account the removal of the wounded from the field had to be commenced the minute the infantry advanced otherwise they would have been left out all night In all about 241 wounded were removed by the dhoolie bearers from the field of action to the field and temporary hospitals The battle lasted from 5 am to about 230 in the afternoon of October 20th 1899 5 To the excellent and careful manner in which all cases The War In South AfricaSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2030 Nov 25 1899 pp 1487149120262610 1203 Nov 25 1899 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA mm B 1487 a and safe as the crests of the rolling undulations Haematuria  red water  is referred to among parasitic diseases as com mon in the lowlying coast country it is also common I may add in the lowlying portions of the Transvaal but these as already stated are not likely to be occupied to any extent by our soldiers The tributaries of the Croco dile River to the immediate north of Johannesburg are infested with the bilharzia parasite The reference to pneu monia is brief but states that it often occurs in the form of epidemics in the Transvaal during the winter months As already pointed out the mortality from this disease on the highlands of South Africa is high and although it is more prevalent in winter than summer it is liable to occur all the year round DISINFECTION A final note in this Appendix commends certain reports for the perusal of the medical officers joining the field force It also adds that any medical officer considering that in order to carry out effectively the measures indicated above for the prevention of disease in connection with standing camps additional materials such as disinfectants are required he should make an immediate demand for them If as I have already suggested the medical officer will only bear in mind that mother earth is by far the most economical and admirable material for his purpose he will be able to avoid unnecessary demands for other disinfectants which may not be readily obtainable at some odd hundred miles from our bases THE WAR IN SOUTTH AFRICA FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRFSPONDENT IN CAPETOWN November 1st THE CENSORSHIP IT is impossible at the present time to send much news with reference to the military medical arrangements for the cam paign In the first place the dispositions which have eo far been made are merely of a temporary nature and will be alto gether remodelled as soon as General Buller has matured his plans and secondly the censorship is so strict that scarcely any information is obtainable as to what has actually been done When I tell you that the Berkshire Regiment were at Stormberg Junction at least a week before any newspaper in Capetown published the informatioin and that only by very slow degrees has the news leaked out that a force in full of some 2500 men is at another pointDe Aarthe readers of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL will understand this And as ven Royal Army Medical Corps information may give a rough indication as to troops either being at a particular place or being likely to be sent there it is except in the simplest details invariably refused For this reticence the ever present Boer spy must be held responsible Such details as are obtainable I will however give EXCELLENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS The arrangements for the war as carried on thus far appear to be very complete The Natal force I am assured from several trustworthy and independent sources is admirably provided from the medical side Colonel Supple the Prin cipal Medical Officer took a journey there shortly before war broke out and saw to every detail so completely that there was practically nothing to do when Sir George White and his staff arrived And the arrangements he then made have stood the test of practice for the Royal Army Medical Corps has proved thoroughly equal to its work at the fairly severe engagements that have already occurred Contrary to what has sometimes happened nothing has been wanting and mirabile dictu matdriel and personnel have so far always been at the right place The bearer company work was heavy at Elandslaagte owing to the extent of ground covered and the intervention of darkness immediately after the action but it was extremely well done Men who were there write me that the Indian bearers are preferred to their white comrades having as one phrases it  the hands of a woman and they exhibit an absolute indifference to the risks of being under fire It is not contemplated to have a base hospital in Natal the present arrangement being that base hospital patients will be brought down here by ship and taken to Wynberg a fashionable suburb about nine miles from this city The barracks there have been entirely vacated and converted into a hospital capable of holding from 550 to 6oo patients It is with very good reason cogisidered that the hot climate of Durban in the summer precludes that place from being used as a hospital base At present no base hospital except Wynberg has been arranged for but it is quite possible that others may be established at Port Elizabeth and East London This however depends entirely on the lines of advance which Sir Redvers Buller may adopt Neither place is an ideal situation for a hospital owing to depressing weather in summer whilst the climate of Wynberg in fact the whole of the Cape Peninsula is all that could be desired TRANSPORT OF SICK AND WOUNDED There is nothing special to note about the Wynberg Hos pital It is fitted up in the ordinary way and is well found in every respect Should any considerable column advance along the eastern frontier a base hospital in that direction might be necessary as the long railway journey would be try ing and as neither Port Elizabeth nor East London has a good harbour sending men down by sea would involve a good deal of trouble and risk Durban is only open to this latter objection in a very slight degree A consignment of sick is already on its way from Natal The ailments are varied but I am told include a good many cases of dysentery or dysenteric diarrhcea I should mention that the accommodation at Wynberg could be easily supplemented by huts if necessary and that there is excellent railway communication right from the Capetown Docks to the Wynberg Station which is very near the hos pital THE AMBULANCE TRAINS The idea is to make use of the railway line to the utmost extent possible and two trains have been already constructed at the local works of the Cape Government Railways under the supervision of the Principal Medical Officer 1 bad the opportunity of inspecting these yesterday and found them very complete and well designed Seven vehicles have been built with two combined pharmacy and kitchen coaches It is intended to run them as two trains usually but although there is through communication from car to car each is detachable and a train or trains can be made up as desired Three of the ambulance vehicles are fitted for 4 officers and 20 men and four for 4 officers and I2 men Being on a narrow gauge line they are of course somewhat deficient in width but they are roomy enough for all practical purposes The bunks are arranged lengthwise in two tiers the upper furnished with weather boards The mattresses are stuffed with horse hair and covered with Berkmeyers prepared waterproof can vas an excellently cool and cleanable  material Each bunk has a handy locker for books glasses and the like The four officer bunks are at one end screened off by curtains Between these bunks and the rest are the side entrances to the vehicles and at this point the uprights sup porting the corner bunks can be turned aside on a hinge thus allowing of turning a stretcher without difficulty There are of course entrances at each end of the coaches Each coach contains a couple of seats for attendants a set of pigeonholes for dressings or bottles and a watercloset The latter discharges direct on to the line without any flush of water a somewhat objectionable arrangement certain to lead to fouling of the sides of the funnel Ventilation is excellent being on the double ridge plan the opening being closed by adjustable screw flaps The pharmacy waggons contain a very well equipped dis pensary with store room a kitchen pantry with refrigerating cupboards room for patients clothing with arm racks and bunks for six attendants There is also a very handy shower bath with dressing room The cars are lighted with oil lamps The officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps and some others of the personnel will be provided with an ordinary saloon carriage The vehicles themselves are calculated to accommodate 12 or I5 personnel They are intended to run up and down the main line of communication THE WORK OF THE CAPETOWN CENTRE OF THE ST JOHN AMBULANCE As at present arranged the Royal Army Medical Corps will 1488 TM t I MEDICAT ARRANGEMENTd FOR SOUTH AFRICA lNov 25 189 convey the wounded or sick as far as De Aar the principal junction of the Colony and there the trains will be taken in hand by parties of trained attendants provided by the Cape town centre of the St John Ambulance Association who will convey them to Wynberg A medical officer will of course accompany each train throughout The conveyance of sick brought from Natal by sea from the ships to Wynberg will also be in the hands of the St John people For this purpose three vehicles have been constructed to hold stretchers racked on the American plan This employment of the St John Association seems a wise arrangement as it will set free a certain number of the Royal Army Medical Corps for more responsible work THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS SurgeonGeneral Wilson arrived yesterday with his Secre taryMajorBedfordRAMC MajorAndersonRAMCisin medical charge at beleaguered Mafeking and Lieut OGorman RAMC at Kimberley each with small detachments of their corps At both places a large amount of civilian ambu lance help has been organised Dr Hayes being at the head at the former place and Dr Smith I believe at the latter A number of civil surgeons have already arrived from England and are for the present at Wynberg and Capetown It is intended as far as possible to keep them at the hospitals This engaging of English civilians appears somewhat super fluous as there are numbers of Colonial men eager to take duty for the pay that would be given to their home brethren Apart from the fact that South Africa is normallv overstocked in the medical line most of our brethren from Johannesburg are at present without occupation There are various detachments of the Royal Army Medical Corps dotted about at Orange River De Aar Nauwpoort Stormberg and intermediate points At De Aar a station hospital is being formed which will be used largely as inter mediate between the front and Wynberg THE CAPE VOLUNTEER MEDICAL STAFF CORPS About 40 of the Cape Volunteer Medical Staff Corps a very welltrained body of men have gone to the various points mentioned above Their commanding officer SurgeonMajor Cox is at De Aar A field dressing has been served out to each man in all the four Several army nurses who arrived last week are at Wynberg where they will probably remain THE DIRECTORGENERAL ON THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOUTH AFRICA SURGEONGENERAL J JAMESON MD CB DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical Service in responding to the toast of The Guests at the annual dinner of the British Gyneco logical Society said We have lately completely transformed the surgical equip ment of the army and brought it up to date sothat every army surgeon in South Africa has now an opportunity of carrying out in a thorough manner modem and scientific surgery Mr Makins before leaving for the war was shown the nature of the equipment and the only suggestion he could make was the addition to it of a few extra nailbrushes At my suggestion three of the most eminent surgeons in EnglandSir William Mac Cormac Mr Treves and Mr Makinshave been appointed by the Secretary of State to act as consulting surgeons at the seat of war This is no reflection upon the skill of the medical officers of the army Such appointments are in accordance with Continental customs and in harmony with ourscheme of mobilisation for home defence The presence of such men will be advantageous by reason of their wide experience and dexterity and I am sure that my brother officers in South Africa will welcome them with open arms The War Office recognising the usefulness in war of hospital transports have sent out two capable of accom modating in each about I70 officers and men They are light draught vessels able to cross the bar at Durban and be brought alongside the wharves so as to facilitate embarkation of sick and wounded In fitting them up we had the benefit of the advice of an able naval officer and of one of our own officers conversant with details and together they made an excellent job of it They are intended to run between Durban and the Cape The Central Committee of the British Red Cross Society are determined to go one better and it is likely they will succeed They have chartered the Midnight Sun a vessel probably known to many of you and her equipment is nearly complete She will be renamed the Princess of Wales in compliment to Her loyal Highness who not only takes a deep interest in all that concerns the happiness comfort and welfare of soldiers but has handed over to the Central Committee a fund of over 6ioooo which was at Her Royal Highnesss disposal The personnel will he supplied by the Royal Army Medical Corps supplemented by civil surgeons and nurses from the Army Nursing Reserve The American ladies of London headed by Lady Randolph Churchill are fitting out a fourth ship and American ingenuity thoroughness and liberality are certain to make it a success The personnel will be entirely American with the exception of one retired army surgeon whose presence on board is considered advantageous for disciplinary purposes and the preparation of invaliding documents the correctness of which may influence rewards and rates of pension The last two ships are intended to ply between the Cape and England A hospital train is also being prepared under the direction of Sir John Furley Sir John is perhaps the greatest living authority on ambulance work He has devoted his whole life to mitigate the sufferings of war This train will be named the  Princess Christian in grateful acknowledgment of the businesslike ability which Eer Royal Highness has shown as a member of the Central Committee and in the creation of the Army Nursing Reserve Roentgen xray apparatus has been supplied liberally There are now ten in South Africa one I am happy to state is at Ladysmith at the present time Through the generosity of private individuals three more will be sent out We have engaged an expert able to repair the instruments if necessary or indeed to make them A large number of our officers are experienced in this form of photography In this war there are two powerful enemies to contend with the Boers and enteric fever In this connection I may be permitted to state that the DirectorGeneral of the United States Army Medical Service in a letter just received mentions that in their late war in Cuba enteric fever was much more deadly to their troops than gunshot wounds In Natal last year the admissionrate for enteric fever was 52 per cent Extraordinary precautions are therefore urgently required After numerous experiments at Netley we came to the conclusion that of the numerous filters in the market only two possessed sterilising powers the PasteurChamberland and the Berkefeld We tried the first during the late war in Ashanti but it would not stand the roughness of transport and soon became unserviceable The Berkefeld is

to all units of corresponding strength As probably you are aware Professor Wright of Netley has been for some years experimenting bj inocula tion against enteric fever The results are encouraging Thus out of 2ooo men inoculated whose ages were under 24 the admissionrate in eight months has been 07 per cent while in 6ooo men not inoculated whose ages were greater and susceptibility therefore less the admissionrate for the same period was exactly doublenamely 14 per cent Of late every officer and man under orders for India or South Africa has been given the opportunity of being inoculated and about 70 per cent have taken advantage of it Gentlemen the results of all these elaborate preparations remain to be told and when Sir Redvers Bullers despatches are published at the end of the war I shall be content if he expresses himself in regard to my Service in language similar to that used by Lord Kitchener when referring to the war in the Soudan that it was characterised by a maximum of com fort and a minimum of suffering MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOUTH AFRICA THE HOSPITAL SHIP  PRINCESS OF WALES THE hospital ship Princess of Wales formerly known to

subject connected with the help given by ladies at Alder shot to Government in the matter of regiments proceeding to South Africa and the outbreak of infectious disease there is well worthy of mention During the time an outbreak of scarlet fever occurred which it was thought might have de lay ed some of the regiments going out to the seat of war Lady Audrey Buller and the Ladies Committee with the entire sanc tion of Sir Redvers Buller took measures for improving the means for the isolation of those who had come in contact with the infected cases A qualified nurse was engaged for the isolation block and under her direction and supervision the most complete precautions were taken to prevent any risk of the spread of infection clothes were provided for those isolated so that all clothing and bedding might be thoroughly disinfected As a result of these precautions the outbreak was confined to narrow limits and the despatch of the troops was not inlerlered with It is gratifying to learn from a local source that the same machinery will be again set in motion whenever required not only because of its benefit to the nation but also to secure the wellbeing of soldiers families The War In South AfricaSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2080 Nov 10 1900 pp 1386138820266347 1203 1386 5n THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICANov 10 1900 in surgery he should be prepared and required to answer any reasonable question in surgical anatomy  also that examiners in anatomy might aid all surgeons somewhat more than they did by laying special stress on such a knowledge of anatomy as was calculated to prove really valuable to the physician or surgeon and less on certain details which though inte resting to a professor of anatomy could be of little value in practice The surgeon could not dispense with an intimate knowledge of anatomy and there was as great a difference between the person who studied anatomy from models casts and draw ings and a real anatomist as there was between the art critic who derived his knowledge from walking picture galleries and the real artist who had worked with his pencil and brush from boyhood Anyone who would undertake to perform an im portant surgical operation without an accurate knowledge of the structures through which he was about to cut or of the parts he was about to expose might be likened to a mariner who attempted to navigate a dangerous coast without previous knowledge of its risks or who was provided only with a chart of which he had good reason to doubt the accuracy It was most requisite also that the surgeon should possess a knowledge of morbid anatomy in its strict sense Closely associated with anatomy was physiology or the science which treated of the natural functions of living organisms But anatomy and physiology did not occupy the leading position chronologically in the curriculum of the medical student Certain other sciences were placed in the forefront These were biology physics and chemistry all of which were essen tial as experience proved to surgery Last but by no means least he should refer to the science of pathology or the study of diseased conditions and processes which strictly speaking bore the same relation to morbid anatomy that physiology did to normal anatomy So far as the study of diseased con ditions in the living was concerned they were provided with ample material in clinical hospitals On the other hand it was with deep regret that he felt obliged to admit that the opportunities for the study of morbid anatomy and pathology were not all that was desirable This was in part due to the natural prejudice amounting almost to asuperstition that existed in Ireland against the performance of postmortem ex aminations In his opinion it would be much better for the whole community at large if that state of things were altered In many cases of death where the obedient coroners jury brought in a verdict of  Death from heart disease often without the slightest medical evidence would a carefully conducted postmortem examination reveal a totally different cause of death He had long been fully persuaded that the extremely careless way in which burials were per mitted in Ireland previous to registration and often without proper certification was a practice strongly to be deprecated and calculated to be a direct incitement to crime and it was certainly time that the authorities awoke to a proper sense of duty in this respect There was however another aspect in which he wished to review this question and that was the condition in which that and the sister colleges had been obliged to remain with regard to the teaching of pathology It certainly would be an unpardonable evasion of duty on his part if he did not protest in the strongest manner at the neglect to which they had been subjected in that respect and it certainly did not redound to the credit of successive Governments that at a time when the importance of pathology in relation to the prevention and treatment of diseases had been recognised in all the civilised countries throughout the globe it should be left to the respective governing bodies of the Queens Colleges in Ireland to pro vide a teacher in pathology for their medical schools in order that they might not be behindhand The manner in which the subject of pathology had been permitted to remain un endowed in the Cork Medical School at the end of the nine teenth century was nothing less than a national disgrace Apart from its importance in relation to medical and surgical teaching there was the advantage to the public of having a skilled pathologist in a fullyequipped laboratory to whom to refer such questions as doubtful cases of rabies the bacterio logical examination of milk and water and at the present moment doubtful cases of the muchdreaded plague Refer ence was then made to surgery as an ait tne importance of training in the manipulative part of surgery was empha sised and in conclusion the means by which a knowledge of the science and art of surgery might best be acquired were described THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL We have received the following letter from Mr 0 Stonham Chief Surgeon and Officer Commanding Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital  Senior Surgeon Westminster Hospital etc  Barberton September 20th I feel sure that you and our friends and colleagues at home will be interested to hear something of the doings of the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital and Bearer Company oc cupying as they do a unique position as the only field hospital and bearer company which has ever left the country under civil auspices Let us hope we shall but prove to be the pioneers of many such should the needs of the Empire un fortunately require their services Before leaving England I heard it asserted more than once that although civilians would prove of inestimable benefit in supplying the needs of stationary and base hospitals they could not succeed in the more arduous and hazardous duties of caring for the wounded on the field nor would they them selves be fitted to withstand the fatigues and hardships neces sarily entailed by marching with an army at the front The career of our Field Hospital and Bearer Company has abundantly proved that doubts such as these are unfounded and I venture to express the opinion that when the final verdict is passed upon our work even the most captious must fain admit that the Field Hospital and Bearer Company have fully justified the most sanguine hopes of those who so patri otically equipped and sent them out The Staff I have the good luck to have associated with me Major G E Hale DSO  RAMC who is in command of the Bearer Company No man could be more agreeable as a companion and fellowworker and his expert knowledge of transport and camp life has been of the utmost service Our noncommissioned officers and men have as a whole worked hard and well comparing most favourably with the men of the regular army and as the majority of them are but prentice hands they are much to be commended In this and my succeeding letters I propose to give you a brief outline of the work we have done The Difficulties of the War On leaving England our great anxiety was that the war would be over before we could reach Capetown now our aspirations are in an opposite channel and our thoughts are turned homewards Our mental condition has undergone much the same change as did the ladys on her first voyage for the first twentyfour hours she expressed fears that the ship would go down during the next few days she was afraid it would not By the way our voyage was not propitious for as is well known our transport the Winkfield collided with and sank the Union liner Mexican seventy miles from Table Bay Had we known the country to which we were going we should not have had any anxiety as to the speedy termination of the war The British are fighting physical geography rather than a people and those who have been out here and have seen what we have seen will be the most lenient in their judgment of reverses and checks which are so easily condemned by some who have only the morning paper as a source of information and know only the physical characters of their own country The Work of the Hospital Since we left England we have marched from Bloemfontein on May 28th up to the present date 1150 miles have been present at eleven engagements and have afforded relief to 1850 patients We have admitted 650 men into hospital who have been carried by the Bearer Companys ambulances some times for days and for long distances until they could be sent Nov io 1900SPECIAL HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICAmKSa I387 by sick convoy to the nearest stationary or base hospital We arrived in Table Bay on April 6th and as our ship was con I siderably damaged in collision we were at once sent into the dock instead of waiting our turn to disembark I need not dwell upon the difficulties we experienced in Capetown in being sent on  at last they were overcome and we entrained on April 29th to proceed north although our actual destina tion was apparently unknown However in due course we arrived at Bloemfontein on May 2nd having stopped for a few hours at Deelfontein to see the Yeomanry Base Hospital and have breakfast with our numerous friends there At fever stricken Bloemfontein we were allotted camping ground in the foulest place which could be found and here we waited till May 28th before we could get transport animals We here packed our wagons and made all ready for a start as soon as we should get orders The Action at Rhenoster River On May 28th we marched underorders to proceed to Kroon stadt We were quite alone and had no escort  indeed we marched alone as far as Pretoriaa very different condition of things as we were to find later to forming part of an advancing army We arrived at Kroonstadt on June 4th drew four days rations and started the next morning for Johannesburg but we were not destined to reach there so quickly as we thought It is now well known from my telegrams and letters which we have seen in the Daily Telegraph that we were present at the action of June 7th when the Boers under General C de Wet destroyed the line at Rhenoster River cut up the 4th Derby Militia and destroyed our mails stores warm cloth ing and ammunition at Roodeval Station which they eventu ally blew up It was here that we first came under fire  the Boers mistaking us for a convoy and reinforcements firing on our waggons but fortunately doing no harm They how ever made no prisoners but gave us every facility for carry ing on our work and showed us many kindnesses until they were driven back by Lord Methuen on June nth after which action we admitted to the hospital 12 wounded Yeomen On June 7th we had 29 killed and 91 wounded the latter keeping us hard at work for two days Many of these men had been injured by fragments of shell the wounds in some cases being exceedingly severe the soft structures being lacerated and the bones much comminuted Our arrival on the scene was providential Dr Buchanan the regimental officer attached to the Derbys was singlehanded and had not the necessary equipment with him for dealing with so many severe cases even had it been in the power of one man to do so Our experiences at Rhenoster were most interesting and I think I may say unique  but as my letters already referred to have given a short account of them I need not dwell on them further It was most unfortunate that we had to move our camp on June 9th a step rendered imperative by the im pending action June 1 ith as De Wet meant to occupy the kopje beneath which we were Moving the patients neces sarily entailed considerable suffering and I regret to say cost some lives which would I think have otherwise been saved On June nth after the action Lord Methuen came round the hospital saw all the wounded men and expressed his satisfaction with our arrangements With the advent of such a large force we of course became very busy as it soon became known that our equipment was all that could be desired On June 14th we sent a sick convoy of 106 by road to Kroonstadt our ambulances taking them all under Major Hales command He returned on June 18th and on the following day I took a further convoy of 102 by train returning the next day I Johannesburg and Pretoria On June 22nd we struck camp and proceeded on the way to Johannesburg arriving there on the 27th and camped in the grounds of the Wanderers Club On June 29th we set out for Pretoria and reached there the next day when I had an interview with Lord Roberts in refer ence to our experiences at Rhenoster River as the result of which he wrote to General de Wet thanking him for his kind ness to us during the time we were in his hands We remained at Pretoria until July 7th camping at Arcadia when we received orders to march and join General Mahons brigade which was at Rietfontein near Irene Failing tocme up with him there we were to continue our march until we found him Accordingly we marched to Rietfontein but the brigade had left so the next day we determined to push on although we had no means of finding out where General Mahon was  but an officer commanding a detachment of Irish Fusiliers who were holding a position near our camp told us he thought Mahon was at Bapsfontein We eventually found the brigade whicL had joined General Hutton at Rietfontein No 6  but on our way we nearly marched into the Boer lines for we had taken a wrong road and only discovered our mis take when we saw and questioned our own advanced outposts whose line we had passed through On July 9th 10th and nth we sent out ambulances as fighting was in progress  but we had very few casualties the Boers being strictly on the defensive On July 12th the camp broke up and the force marched back to Pretoria We however went with 50 sick to Springs where we arrived late in the afternoon and were lucky enough to be able to send the sick to Johannesburg the same evening by train The following day we telegraphed to the PMO Pretoria for instructions and received orders to return to Pretoria at once We marched on July 15th and arrived on the 17th Up to this time we had been marching by ourselves  but we were now to become part of an advancing force particulars of which I shall give you in my next letter SPECIAL HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA THE WELSH HOSPITAL The Committee of the Welsh

Consumption and Tuberculous Milk A conference was held at Wakefield on October 24th between the Sanitary Committee of the West Riding County Council and a deputation representing the Urban and Rural District Councils of the Riding to consider the relation of the milk supply to public health and the treatment of consumption in the human being The want of unanimity amongst the various councils on the adoption o the  model milk clauses suggested the desirability of an appeal to Parliament for general legislation on the lines of the Public Health Scot land Act of 1897 The education of Parliament being how ever a co3tly undertaking it was decided to invite the repre sentatives of the county boroughs to a friendly conference at which the whole subject of tuberculosis in milk and in human beings will be considered Sanatorium for Consumptives for Portsmouth The Portsmouth Board of Guardians have recently had be fore them the question of the freshair treatment of consump tion The medical officers of the infirmary having considered  the matter Dr Gaston reported that with certain alterations 1 two of the existing wards of the infirmary might be made suitable for the purpose Drs Knott and H W Morley though agreeing that the two wards selected were the best available in the infirmary considered that the treatment  should be carried out in a specially constructed sanatorium and under a specially trained staff of nurses and medical officers who could carry out the necessary discipline The Board after consideration agreed with this view of the matter and unanimously passed a resolution in the following terms  That in the opinion of this Board accommodation for the isolation and treatment of persons suffering from consumption should be provided by sanitary authorities and that the whole of the Boards of Guardians in the county be requested to join this Board in petitioning the  Hants County Council to provide a sanatorium to which Boards of Guardians may send patients at a fixed rate Consumptive Hospital for Perth The Committee of Management of the Society for the Treatment and Relief of Incurables and Chronic Ailments and Care of Convalescents in Perth and Perthshire have secured ground on the Barnhill Slope 300 feet above sea level for the erection of a sanatorium for consumptives The building which will accommodate from 16 to 20 patients will have a southern aspect and be well sheltered from the north and east Sir Robert and Lady Pullar have provided the necessary funds to build the sanatorium A bazaar sup ported by many persons of rank and influence is to be held in Perth in September 1901 to raise the remainder of the sum of ioooo required for endowment nearly half of which has already been subscribed The Prevention of Tuberculosis in Lancashire The Lancashire County Council having decidedas that of the West Riding of Yorkshire and other councils have already doneto consider the question of a systematic campaign against tuberculosis the Public Health Committee of that body requested the county medical officer to prepare informa tion which would place the Committee and the County Council in a proper position for giving this very important subject the thoughtful consideration it deserves Dr Edward Sergeant has accordingly prepared a report on the prevalence and prevention of tuberculous with special refer ence to the establishment of sanatoria He points out that in the administrative county of Lancashire the deaths from phthisis during the year 1899 numbered 2305 representing a total of from 6000 to 7oco persons suffering from the disease If the phthisis mortality of the county could be reduced by a quarterwhich is well within the possibilities of sanatorium treatmentthe saving to the county might be represented by 75000 per annum after allowing a good sum towards the cost and maintenance of patients whilst under treatment Dr Sergeant gives examples of sanatoria in England and on the Continent to show what has already been done He finds that the usual cost of treatment in these sanatoria varies from jC3 to s a week with extras and is therefore prohibitive to the vast majority of sufferers The Grabowsee Sanatorium about 20 miles north of Berlin which has been in existence four and ahalf years and is intended for the poorer class shows that the average daily cost for each patient can be brought down to about 3s This institution which was described and illustrated in the British Medical Journal of July 29th 1899 p 283 consists of a dozen to eighteen Docker huts each capable of accommodating eight patients By the establishment of a colony of such huts the cost of a sanatorium need not exceed 150 to 3C0 per bed This amount will however necessarily vary according to the number of patients to be provided for and the character of the building Although Boards of Guardians appear to have the power to provide sanatoria it is a question whether similar power belongs to county councils Dr Sergeant however points out that under the Isolation Hospitals Act 1893 it is the duty of county councils to provide hospitals for those suffering from  infectious diseases including certain diseases specific ally mentioned in the Notification Act and any other infectious disease by order of the Council It seems therefore per missible under this Act for county councils to erect sanatoria for consumptives THE DOSAGE OF DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN From a Correspondent It appears from inquiries which have recently been ad dressed to the British Medical Journal that the question of the dosage of diphtheria antitoxin is one whih still pre sents difficulties to some practitioners Nor is this surpris ing In the first place the dosage of the serum remedies is based upon principles very different from those which hold I in ordinary pharmacy  we have to deal with units instead of I grains or minims In the second place in some parts of the I country diphtheria is rare so that a practitioner resident there in may have had no occasion to treat a single case since the j introduction of the remedy into this country in 1894 Con sequently the following remarks based upon an experience of I a very large number of cases extending over six years may be found useful and are offered in the hope that they may prove of service to some practitioner whose experience of the treatment of the disease since the introduction of antitoxin has been limited I General Considerations In the first place it must be pointed out that it is impossible to give a fatal overdose of antitoxin  it is not like opium and strychnine and such drugs to the dose of which there is a I definite limit Why not therefore it may be asked give a I large dose straight away in every case whatever its degree of severity  Against this there are three reasons First the I volume to be injected is large with very big doses which in I creases the discomfort at the seat of injection and is more I likely than a small dose to give rise to the rash and febrile I disturbance which is often met with a week or so later I Secondly the expense of the treatment is increased especi I ally if to lessen the volume a concentrated serum be em ployed Thirdly it is quite unnecessary to inject a large dose in a mild case Even in the severe forms of the disease I there is a limit dse to exceed which is merely to waste the I material Out of these considerations arise the questions I What is a mild case of diphtheria and what are the mini I mum and maximum doses  Mild Cases in Children I In answering the former in any given case the age of the j patient is of the highest importance Before the introduction I of the antitoxin treatment half the patients under 5 years of age admitted to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums I Board died and many of the remaining half narrowly escaped I death Diphtheria in children under 5 is an exceedingly I serious disease it is very serious up to 10 28 per cent mortality and is still seriou from 10 to 15 10 per cent mortality After that age it becomes less serious 4 to 5 per I cent mortality up to the age of 40 when it again rises I Therefore every child under 15 should certainly be treated I with antitoxin If the case is a mild onethat is to say if I the exudation or membrane is limited to a part of one or both I tonsils and there is no nasal discharge or evidence of laryngeal j implication  and further if there is little or no glandular The War In South AfricaAuthors G H Makins and A South African CampaignerSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2035 Dec 30 1899 pp 1809181220262982

your ireaders After a three days stay at Capetown during which opportunity occurred of seeing the patients in the base hos pital at Wynberg brought from Natal SurgeonGeneral Wil son kindly brought me up to this field hospital and during an eight days stay some 6oo wounded men have passed through the hands of the RAMC here An immense amount of work has been done by these field hospitals under Majors Murray Birch Coutts and Knaggs in one night alone 300 patients arrived from the fight at Modder River Thesl hos pitals are really acting for the present as stationary hos pitals since all the wounded have received their  firstaid  dressing and been passed through the field hospitals at the immediate front The work is performed under some difficul ties as it is very hot and dusty on the veld Yesterday for instance the thermometer registered 1I50 F in some of the tents Fortunately the patients are able to be removed every few days to the base by means of two excellent hospital trains which have been improvised from the ordinary railway stock by the RAMC The fact that the journey fror hiere to the base hospital at Wynberg takes 28 hours emphasises the difficulties due to the immense length of the line of communi cation BULLET WOUNDS Your readers are no doubt by this time in possession of some information as to the cases at present at Wynberg so I shall confine myself to a short account of what I have seen in this camp I may say at once that the immense majority of the wounds have been inflicted by the Mauser or LeeMetford bullets and a small proportion by Martini bullets and large projectiles I shall refer to the wounds by the small calibre bullets only The Mauser and LeeMefford A wounded Boer referred to the LeeMetford as a  gentle manly bullet and this remark is equally applicable to the Mauser The wounds made by them are small clean and little disposed to suppurate and the tendency to suppuration is no doubt decreased by the excellent physical condition of the patients and the healthiness of the district Shock as a sign has been conspicuous by its absence even in the most serious cases and gives little or no aid in the diagnosis of visceral injury Retained bullets are compara tively uncommon no doubt on account of the fact that most of the men have been wounded in rapid advances The bullets met with have been little deformed unless they have struck stones before entering and I have seen no single instance which would suggest the use of either flattened or socalled explosive bullets among the wounded here The only large exit wounds have been one or two opposite comminuted fractures Wounds of Vessels Wounds of the soft parts are as a rule simple tracks with but little difference between the aperture of entry and exit such wounds heal in a few days with no surrounding indura tion or cedema In cases where vessels of any size are impli cated especially in such regions as beneath the deltoid gluteus maximus or the two layers of the calf considerable deep hwemorrhages often occur and are rapidly absorbed but free hmemorrhage from the wound itself is rare Wounds of great vessels naturally have not come under our observation in any number but one patient died in a few seconds soon after admission with sudden swelling of the belly another had a swelling some dulness and a thrill over the area of the innominate artery and one case of fractured femur had apparently an injury to the femoral vein This may I think be considered a very small proportion out of the total number of cases Wounds oJ Nerves Wounds of individual nerves will I think be a great feature of the campaign Wounds of the median ulnar musculo spiral alone or in various combinations are common I have seen two isolated injuries to the great Eciatic and one of the spinal acceseory nerve In some cases the evidence is in favour of complete section in others diminution of power combined with great hypersesthesia suggests contusion or partial laceration Fractures and Wounds of Joints Fractures are for the most part transverse or the bones are tunnelled with a simple track Comminution in the series seen here is distinctly rare either in the flat or long bones and certainly a lar2e number of the wounds have been inflicted well within the i ooo yards range Joint perforations especially of the knee are fairly common The cases left us too soon to form any opinion as to their per manent results but everything pointed to these concurring with those to be seen at Wynberg where little functional or structural alteration is to be observed Wounds of the Head The proportion of wounds of the head is small some fractures with much bursting at the wound of exit have been met with naturally many may have been left on the field and I think only some three or four have come down here Many extraordinary cases will no doubt be recorded thus for example entry in the median line below the chin perfora tion of the floor of the mouth and tongue the alveolar process of the superior maxilla traverse of the floor of the orbit injury to the back of the globe perforation of the anterior fossa and escape through the frontal bone at the margin of the hairy scalp The patient thus wounded left here on the fourth day without any symptoms Several others of a similar but slightly less complicated nature have been seen Wounds of the Neck Wounds of the neck have been very common but we have seen noile implicating the great vessels excepting the one already referred to A number of wounds of the posterior triangle with mixed nerve injuries are however under treat ment The small bullet Effects the most complete transverse sec tion of the spinal cord No fewer than io cases of paraplegia have come down from the front usually complete symmetri cal and with total absence of patellar reflex Time only will show how complete these injuries are but one from Belmont died here on the fourth day the remainder from Modder River have gone down to Wynberg Perforating Wounds of the Chest Perforating wounds of the chest have been numerous pro ducing remarkably slight symptoms Hremoptysis slight in degree persisting one to three days occurs in onethird of the cases a few have signs of blood in the pleura and a few have cellular emphysema The only constant sign is a want of respiratory mobility on the injured side and some diminution of breath sounds Wounds of the Abdomen I have seen fourteen wounds of the abdomen of these ten have exhibited no serious symptoms and will probably all get well The pulses have not risen above 8o and the only signs have been some local tenderness rigidity and deficient mobility of the belly all came here on the third day after the injury slight vomiting occurred in some of them before arrival In two cases the injury probably implicated the kidney and in one the liver but in all three the hremorrhage must have been very slight Albdominal ctions In four instances peritoneal infection had already occurred three of the patients being Boers and one an English officer The latter had suffered an injury to the ceecum abdominal section was done on the third day and he is doing well at the end of the week but still with a discharging wound abdo minal section was also done for a partly intraperitoneal partly retroperitoneal injury to ascending colon retrocolic extrava sation and emphysema had already occurred The wound was found and the affected area drained the patient is still living eighth day but will certainly succumb to seps s from the 1810 21 lmt tm THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA DEC 30 1899 large foul cavity in his loin The remaining two were cases of injury to the small intestine One was tco ill for operation The second was opened and three perforations in the jejunum were discovered and sutured Purulent inflammation had however already spread as low as the pelvis and the patient died the day following the operation All that can be said from this experience is that no patient should be operated upon from the mere fact of apparent traverse of the belly by a Mauser or LeeMetford bullet It is possible that if the patients could have been seen sooner operation might have been earlier decided upon in the four cases who were so treated but the great number of wounded at the front rendered this an impossibility OPERATIONS AT THE FIELD HoS PITALS Operations at the field hospitals have been very few in number I think at the most six amputations have gone down to Wynberg and there can be little doubt that such operations will be comparatively infrequent in this series of cases The cases as a whole started remarkably well There has been no serious wound infection up to the present a great tribuite to the care with which the dressings have been applied in the lhospitals and on the field by the hardworked officers of the RAMC In this camp during the last week on several occasions the officers were up all night or went to bed at 12 to rise at 4 AMu The heat durixng the day has been very great io8 to I15 F in thebell tents il the afternoons of the last few days From Our Special Correspondent In Capetown December 6th 1899 ARRIVAL OF LORD METHUENS WOUNDED SINCE the series of battles north of the Orange River a very large number of wounded have come down and the RAM has plenty of work on its hands I can confirm my previous remarks that it is rising to the occasion most creditably No I General Hospital has now 574 beds occupied No 2 Hospital has been established as I mentioned was to be the case on adjoining ground at Wynberg It has about ioo beds in occupation Almost all the cases are surgical and the distinction between the medical and surgical divisions in No I has so far as the class of case is concerned been prac tically abolished WOUNDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY Wounds of the extremitiesespecially the upper part of the lower extremitycontinue to be mueb in evidence and the vast majority of injuries are from rifle bullets The few Ehell cases appear merely to be from small fragments and are of a very unimportant nature One new feature is appearing in the cases from the First Divisiona considerable proportion of compound fractures of the thigh due no doubt to a certain number of the Free Staters who are operating in the North using rifles other than the Mauser Tlise fractures have not done as well as one would have lik ed though perhaps quite as well as could have been expected several have had to be followed by amputation and were eptic on arrival and death has been the result of a somewhat large proportion The rule appears to be to send the compound fractures to the base in preference to amputating in the field or at the stationary ho3pitals The former would have been manifebtly impossible in view of the rapid woveaieents of Lord Methuens force ABDOMINAL NVOUNDS Except as regards these compound fractures and that despair of military surgery the perforating abdominal wound the results continue to be remarkably good One case of the latter class I saw however whieh is doing admirably A Mauser bullet had entered on the left side just above the pelvic brim and had emerged on the opioosite side by way of a hole in the ileum itself lt had evidently pprforated the posterior wall of the bladder and established a communica tion between that viscus and the rectum for the muan was and still is passing all his urine per rectum Very little extravasation could have taken place before the securing of the fistulous communication although the patient had pretty severe peritonitis This has now subsided and the patient is doing splendidly Mr Treves saw him and advised that no operation should be undertaken HEAD INJURI ES The head injuries have done on the whole very well I saw one very successful case The bullet hacd entered the cranium near the middle line and had splintered the bone in a depressed gutter down along the course of the upper part of the Rolandic fissure One of the civilian surgeons trephined and removed a large number of spicules and small plates of bone The patient hd typical Jacksonian convulsions before operation and for tw days later but for four days these have ceased his temperature has gone down to normal and le is doing very well He is somewhat dull but has never been aphasic Another patient who was trephined in the occipital region has done very well no symptoms remaining except some photophobia WOUND OF THF SPINE Another case presents some features of interest A bullet had entered almost exactly in the midspinal line at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra abd had travelled down wards the man being lying down at the time and lodged at the level of the seventh dorsal whence it was removed The lower extremities are paralysed there is overflow dribbling from the bladder and total aneesthesiaas high as the fifth rib with a zone of hyperaesthesia above This zone is now about two fingers breadth and the hyporresthesia is not nearly so intense as before When the case fisEt came in the byper resthetic tract was very much wider no expansion of the anresthesia has so occurred no depression can be discovered He is being treated expectantly with an idea of possibly doing a laminctomy later THE RED CROSS The Red Cross people are doing good work a continuoua supply of comforts finding their way to thehospitals Colonel Young has left for the north Several local societies have been established under his control and at the intermediate stations some of them are doing gooi work in suppying afew extras to the men in transit The Relief Committee for men has engaged the services of a paid medical officer Dr Duthie The Women and Childrens Committee still gets on very well with voluntary medical aid THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNEiR VI THE AFRICAN SUINVAIER THE summer is now well advanced in South Africa and severat despatches complain of the intense heat The two most trying monthsJanuary and Februaryhave yet to come It ia during the summer especially the later summer months that typhoid fever and dysentety are most rife in all South African towns Sir George Whites report of ecember i8th will there fore cause little surprise to anyone acquainted with the country He says they have in Ladysmith 65 men  seriously afflicted by enteric fever and dysentery but this is not a very large proportion in a garrison of 90ooo It is no greater than usually obtains at this time of the year among the miners along the line of reef at Johannesburg The sanitary system in both cases is probably principally to blame The latrine and pail systems are when accompanied hv a free and thorough uee of dry earth theoretically perfect but in practice a certain amount of nuisance and sickness invariably appear to arise in connection with them during the hot summpr months The garrison at Ladysmith ig not confined within particularly narrow limits and in all probability their sanitary arrangements are about as good now as they would be in times of peace At the same time it must be borne in mind that the majority of our troops are at the mast susceptible age and that newcomers to the country always appear more liable to atack than older residenti It will be interesting to learn what proportion if aDy of the men affected withi typhoid were injected with antityphoid serum THE WOUNDED The wounded in Ladysmith are reported by Sir G White to be all doing well while we are informed that of the men wounded in Lord Methuens various engagements no fewer than a third have already recovered This is cheering news to friends of the wounded and the interesting letters from your correspondent at Capetown further show bow very DzC 30 18991 TfE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA I 18 X quickly and completely many of the Mauser bullet wounds heal THE SICK AND WOUNDED BEING SENT HOME A letter from Mr George Stoker questioning the wisdom of sending sick and wounded soldiers home appeared in the Times of December 22nd Mr Stoker has shown great practical interest in this question and was the chief organiser of the Portland Field Hospital which sailed for South Africa n December 13th under charge of a staff appointed by the War Office It will be remembered that the War Office made their acceptance of the hospital conditional on its being put entirely on a military footing and under military control Mr Stoker says the difficulties to treatment in South Africa appear to be classified under three heads i Climate 2 Accommodation  Sentiment I As for climate I speak with a large experience of the treatment of the sick and wounded in war in various climates and I venture to say that the climate of the uplands of South Africa whether in Natal the Trans vaal the Orange Free State or the old Colony is all that can be desired The Ulundi wounded were treated in Ladysmith and did splendidly 2 AccommodationThis 4s surely a matter of arrangement and in such a climate nothing can be better than a properly equipped marquee hospital betterI venture to thinkthan any improvised buildings whieh are seldom convenient and hardly ever sanitary better far than Netley Hospital where at this season especially there is little choice between foul air and freezing 3 SentimentI think this consideration should not be allowed to interfere in preventing the best being done for the sick and wounded In conclusion let us not forget the great pain and discomfort to sick and wounded that long transport entails and anything that helps to avoid this must be an advantage Unfortunately the uplands of South Africa are at present more in the hands of the Boers than of ourselves although no doubt Estcourt and Maritzburg in Natal and say Beau fort West in the Karoo might be used for fiela hospitals But the fact is as I pointed out in a former letter there is ample demand in the present war for accommodation both in South Africa and in Engiand Probably only the severe cases with no prospect of recovery during the present campaign will be sent home and their desire would naturally be to be near their friends Mr Stokers reference to Netley is I think hardly fair The hospital is beautifully situated and appointed the wards are lofty airy and well warmed For the convalescents there is a reading room long covered glass corridors and magnificent grounds The British soldier need not complain if he never finds himself in worse qumters than Netley Hospital THE SEVENTH DIVISION THE following is the medical staff of the Seventh Division for South Africa and of officers detailed to Bearer Companies and Field Hospitals Staff Principal

a committee for the working of a Sick and Wounded Officers Surgical and Medical Aid Fund is in course of formation under the presidency of the Duke of Abercorn KG We understand that the purpose of the fund is to assist sick and wounded officers who on return from South Africa may stand in need of special or prolonged treat ment It is intended that careful inquiry should be made as to the pecuniary needs of such officers and a number of lead ing physicians and surgeons in London and the provinces have joined the Duke of Abercorns preliminary committee We believe that a meeting of the committee to consider the exact nature of the help needed and the mode in which it should be rendered will be held at an early date HOME HOSPITALS AND CONVALESCENT HOMES The committee of the Passmore Edwards Convalescent Home for Mem bers of Friendly Societies at Herne Bay has offered to the War Office the use of 20 beds in the institution for the occupation of soldiers who are invalided home from South Africa The only condition attached to the offer is that the men chosen must be members of friendly societies in ac cordance with the trust deed of the institution A large detached building capable of holding some 8o beds has been taken at Windsor as a convalescent home This establishment is to be called the South African Convalescent Home for woundedandin valided soldiers and sailors From this it is proposed to pass them on to the other branch of the home at WestgateonSea It is proposed also to establish another branch of the home at the Isle of Wight

poration to take thewaters free of charge and will be comfortably housed while they are undergoing the cure The Liverpool Royal Infirmary has informed the DirectorGeneral AMS that 22 beds will be held at the disposal for sick and wounded sol diers from South Africa who may belong to the Liverpool district The Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital has made a similar offer of 20 beds COLONIAL

SOUTH AFRICA With Special Plate FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT INJURIES OF THE LONG BONES FEw injuries met with in the military hospitals are of greater surgical interest than bullet wounds of the long bones These injuries may not possess the almost sensational interest that attaEches to some of the more remarkable penetrating or per forating wounds of the cavities of the body or of the head  but they exhibit very remarkable features and tat the skill and patience of the surgeons to the utmost It is of tourse premature in commenting on these as on any other class of injuries to deduce at present too definite conclusions The opinions that seem to benow generally entertained so far as I have been able to gather them from others and supplement them by my own observations may be greatly modified by further experience It must also be freely acknowledged that on several points opinions are by no means unanimous as for instance the difference of effect noted in injuries received at sh6rt or long ranke At the same time it is tolerably safe to assert that the  humane  character of the smallbore bullet wound is just as strikingly exemplified in lesions of the long bones as in other varieties of ipjuries Not only limbs but lives are saved that previous military surgical experience would have been led to consider hopeless but I believe it to be true however unflattering the statement may appear to be that this gratifying result is mainly due to the character of the wound and but little to any general advance in surgical procedure or even to any perfection in carrying out from the first the antiseptic treat ment Hitherto pygemia erysipelas and thh like prevent able disorders if they have been met with at all have been of the very rarest occurrence Nothing can be more grati fying or satisfactory but this admirable result must be ascribed to its true cause Even suppuration is rare but there is no doubt that it is beginning to be seen more fre quently than at first The next campaign may take place under very different conditions of climate to the present war and amidst unfavourable surroundings the enormous value of antiseptic treatment of wounds is likely to show out much more clearly for truth to tell there is a good deal that might sometimes be justly criticised in the military hospitals with regard to the carrying out the details of antiseptic treat ment The undoubtedly successful results shown by the hospitals constitute rather a triumph for the openair method than for antiseptic principles as ordinarily practised DISTORTION OF THE MAUSER BULLET It is desirable at once to modify the opinion expressed in a previous letter with regard to wounds from ricochet bullets At first it was imagined that most of the bullets that were much distorted and showed splitting up of the nickel sheath such as Nos 3 and 4 in Fig III see Special Plate were ricochet shots Some of them may be but there is no doubt whatever that prodigious distortion may be produced in a Mauser bullet if it strikes the shaft of a long bone The Mauser bullet has a much thinner sheath than the LeeMetford The illustration Fig IV shows a Mauser and a Lee Metford bullet side byside of the natural size The bullets were on precisely the same parIe when the photograph was taken and the comparative sizes can thereforebe easilygauged 4 section hasbeen made through the upper portion of the bullete so asto show the respective thicknesses of the nickel sheathi lt will be in teresting heieafter to learn whether the effect on the long bones and in the bullet differs at all in the case of the Lee Metford Doubtless some opportunities have been a4forded of judging of the nature of the wounds made by our rifie though tlhe remarkable returns of casualties furnished by the Standiard and Diggers News or issued from Pretoria do not eeem to hold out any great probabilities in that direction CONDITIONS INFLUENCINm ETXENT OF DAMAGE DONE TO Boras The extent of damage done to the bone depends of course materially on the portion that is struck theeffects on the elastic shaft with i its large amount of compact tissue being different from the effects on the cancellous eds  Againthe range must be taken into account There is however great difficulty in bbtaining reliable information on this point Apart from the notunnatural tendency on the part of the men to assume that their wounds were inflicted at very short range the conditions under which many of the engagements were fought must have rendered it almost impossible to estimate the range Too often our men have been exposed to fire from many quarterS and with an almost invisible enemy using smokeless powder little more than a vague guess can be ex oectedl1 In certain actions however it is probable that the bulk of the wounlds were inflicted at short range Thus the Highland Brigadb at the battle of Magersfontein were beyond question very elose to the enemy In others such as the action of Willa Grange the wounds were inflicted at long range  Judging by skiagraphs and by close examination of t0ie very nnumerous cases met with in the hospitals the differ ence between the injuries inflicted at short and long range is less than would be expected It is imagined by some that a small bore projectile travelling at very high velocity and rotating rapidly through a bone exerts a kind of expanding action in the bone bursting it in fact and producing the same sort of effect as at short range it certainly does in the skull The evidence of such effects is not very conclusive A furtherpoint that must be taken into account is the angle at which the bone is struck The bullet may hit the sbaft full in the centre strike it more or lesse obliquely in its length just touch the edge of the 4ciaphysis or groovethe bone transversely The line drawn betweenthe aperturea of entrance and exit when both openings are present does not afford a very reliable clue Nor it must be admitted in many instances does skiagraphy The difficulties for example of getting a satisfactory skiagraph of a fractured femur in a muscular young man are very considerable Inithe hospitals the patients have to be transported a long distance and the good that might be gained from a skiagraph showing the nature of the fracture would be more than balanced by the harm that would result from rousing the patient and disturb ing the part Skiagraphy therefore in injuries of the long bones of the lower extremity is usually deferred until some union has taken place The appearances then are misleading for the callusis pervious to the rays BULLET WOUNDS OF CANCELLOUs BONE AND JOINTS Bullets striking the enlarged and highly cancellous extremi ties of long bones appear to drill cleanly through only in certain situations Thus many cases Are met with in which the condyles of the femur must unquestionably have been drilled through withOut fracture taking place The patella is usually drilled but may be simply fractured and cases are numerous in which the course of the bullet shows that the end of the femur must have been perforated as well as the kneejoint The recoveries from such injuries are now so familiar as almost to have ceased to excite especial interest Here the ange as far as can be judged has little effect in determining the extent of the injury At veryshort range we should expect if any bursting action were exerted on the bone that fractures of the lower end of the femur extending into the kneejoint would be common I have scarcely been able to find any Heemarthrosis is a frequent symptom but the swelling usually subsides rapidly A major in the RAMC who had seen active service in Chitral re marked to me on the  astonishing contrast between wounds about the knee in that campaign and the pre pent one A bullet striking the patella and injuring the femur in that campaign was likelyto convert the cavity of the kneejoint into a mere bag of commitiutedfragments of bone Amputation was the only resources Ia the present campaign it seems scarceVly necessary to put on a splint for a few days tStrangelr enough the ipper end of the tibia does not seem to behave iu the meway7I ae at rate seen several instances ih which this portion of the bone was extensively splintered by bullets and the frwture might then extend into the lineejoint Much the same effect is seen when the lower end of the tibia is struck and indeed some of the most troublesome cases to deal with as regards saving the limb are those in which the lower end of the tibia is MEDICALJUNALT aI SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALS IN SOUTH

simply fractured and not a few cases have been seen in which this bone has been broken by a bullet that had previously passed tbrough the neck or through the skull I have met with no cases in which the head of the humerus was cleanly drilled without fracture though some such may have been recorded The lower end of the humerus may be drilled but it is more common for a large fragment to be broken off Here again when the bullet bas traversed the elbowjoint surprisingly little trouble follows Complete restoration of mobility is the rule unless and this ts common the amount of callus thrown out limits the move anent The lower end of the radius might be drilled if the bullet entered on the anterior or posterior aspect just as the carpal or tarsal bones may be drilled Of such injuries to these small bones mention has been made in a previous letter BULLET WOUNDS Of THE SEHAFT OF LoNG BONES It is stated by some and the opinion seems to be borne out by experiments in the cadaver that at very close range a bullet striking the shaft of a long bone will sometimes break clean off and carry out through a large aperture of exic a por tion of the entire shaft of the bone some inches in length It is difficult to understand how such an injury is mechanically brought about by a smallbore bullet but any such observa tion resting on a sound experimental basis is conclusive I have met with no such cases in the wards though this of course does not imply any question of their occurrence The only instance resembling the injury I saw in the Fort Hos pital at Pietermaitzburg A large portion of thp ulaa had been carried clean away But this injury was inflicted by a small shell fired from a Nordenfeldt or Hotchkiss gun and the aperture of entry is of course proportionately large Compound fractures showring a small aperture of en trance and a large one of exit are common enough but the tendency of the fracture seems almost invari ably to be oblique The Mauser bullet at short or long range will break up the bone it passes though into numerous little fragments which it carries up to or through the aperture of exit In Fig V for instance

estimate given of iSo yards The radius is seen to have been transversely grooved The bullet entering on the radial and passing out on the ulnar 4side has carried away a number of small fragments of bone and spread them along its track The aperture of exit was imall  The radus in this case was completely fractured the break having but a slight obliquity The fragments as seen are scarcely at all displaced The large aperture of exit when it is found iR usually the result of a number of broken pieces of bone many of them of con siderable size being carried through the wound In its action on the shaft of a long bone therefore the Maiiser bullet may behave like the old round bullet And these effects may be produced when the bullet undergoes no alteration whatever in shape but passes clean through the limb making an aperture of exit the same in size and character as that of entrance In such cases of course the comminuted fragments of bone are not driven out of the limb but merely displaced move or lees It does not at all follow therefore that because a bone is extensively comminuted or even that there is great laceration of the soft parts that the provisions of the Geneva Convention have been necessarily infringed That bullets are in some instances sdoctored and that forbidden kinds of bullets are occasionally used is beyond all question true for such bullets have been removed but it is but just to state that instances of the kind are of extreme rarity In any kind of contest the mere suggestion of unfair play is apt to make people lose their heads quickly and when in warfare the question of infringement of metbods sanctioned by civilised communities is raised exaggera tion is prone to run riot on very slight evidence and on very insufficient data That Mauser bullets whea they impinge on the elastic shaft of a wellgrown bone in a young man may undergo much distortion tthough they have not been submitted to any previous tampering seems perfectly clear The bullets shown in Fig III all of which were extracted furnish proof enough No I was re moved from beneath the infraspinatus muscle The bullet had struck the humerus obliquely and caused an oblique fracture of the bone It had then probably altered its course and glanced upwards lodging beneath the muscle The bullet is seen to be slightly bent over at the point and flattened at the base but the distortion is really greater than it appears in the photograph The bullet was almost certainly fired at long range The aperture of entry was that of a normal Mauser bullet so that as also in the case of the other bullets shown in the illustration the distortion must have been produced by striking on the bone It may be noted with regard to this case that though the Mauser bullet appears invariably to make a perfectly straight track from entrance to exit when it remains of normal shape it may when bent up deviate more or less possibly in some cases behave like the round bullet in former days which if it struck an elastic bone like a rib might glance half way or more round the body      4  S Fig VIMeG wouaded at Colenso December

THE PORTLAND HOSPITAL IN SOUTH AFBICA By Anthony A Bowlby FRCS Senior Surgeon to the Hospital  AssistantSurgeon to St Bartholomews Hospital London Bloemfontein May Slst 1900 Site of the Hospital The Portland Hospital arrived here six weeks ago having been sent up from Kondebosch as soon as the line was clear enough to allow it to get through these difficulties of transit being due to the destruction of the Orange River bridges and the urgent necessity of sending supplies of food and clothing for the army We found an admirable camping ground about a mile to the southwest of the town on the slope of a hill and near to excellent wells the water supply being indeed the chief attraction for much of the drinking water in the town itself was bad and it had to be carted to very considerable distances owing to the occupation of the waterworksby the enemy and the cutting off of the regular supply Enteric Fever The health of the troops was bad They had been without proper tents or shelter and the nights had often been pouring wet  the ground in many places was a swamp and much of it had been fouled Owing to the forced march from Kim berley many regiments were short of boots and clothing and food had been scanty and men had frequently been on short rations There was therefore plenty of reason for sickness and diarrhoea and dysentery were common There was unfor tunately a worse enemy to come and within a few days of their occupation of Bloemfontein enteric fever broke out in many camps and spread rapidly It appeared to have been brought in by the men in many cases but it is certain that in many other cases it was acquired through bad water or other local insanitary conditions and various localities such as ThabaNchu acquired a bad reputation which was very well deserved At this time there were no general hospitals at Bloemfontein and in spite of utilising many public buildings in the town the field hospitals rapidly became overcrowded so that they had to accommodate three or four times the num bers for which they were equipped and it became impossible to nurse or treat the patients satisfactorily As soon therefore as we were ready to take the patients the tents were filled with cases of enteric fever from field hospitals and it became necessary to increase the hospital accommoda tion by the addition of more tents so that we soon had 160 beds instead of ioo We put aside two large tents holding 18 beds each for the treatment of enteric alone but unfortunately these were quite insufficient for all our cases of this class which at one time reached nearly ioo The Wounded The opening of Nos 8 and 9 General Hospitals now enabled the field hospitals to empty in part at least and to join in the general advance and a few days after we arrived our first wounded were sent to us whilst within the next fortnight some 60 or 70 of them came into hospital They were chiefly men of the cavalry and mounted infantry and almost all were wounded by Mauser bullets though one at least had been hit by an expanding bullet Among the first thirtyfive men who arrived no fewer than six had been wounded in the kneejoint In two of these the lower end of the femur was broken across and comminuted and in two others it had been simply bored through without any transverse fracture In another case the upper end of the tibia had been similarly perforated and in the sixth patient the bullet had passed through the left thigh and lodged in the right knee This man was also the subject of enteric fever at the time he was shot but this made no difference to his wounds which healed well on the left side at once though the entry wound over the right knee did not close till the bullet was extracted after he had passed through a very severe attack of enteric fever In the case of the patient shot through the tibia the joint remained painful and swollen for several weeks and showed a decided tendency to contraction and ankylosis though there was no tendency at all to suppura tion and no pyrexia Another interesting case was that of an officer shot in the gluteal region two days before admission  the bullet had not perforated and there was much stiffness of the hipjoint The x rays showed the bullet lying close to the articulation and an exploratory operation disclosed it embedded in the bone forming the upper part of the acetabulum a position from which it required a good deal of force to extract it This officer had previously been in the Portland Hospital for a wound through the right side and he again returned to his regiment a fortnight after the bullet was removed from the neighbourhood of his hip joint At one of the numerous fights near the waterworks the regi ment known as Marshalls Horse suffered severely especially in officers Of these one was killed the major himself was shot through the left lung and three of his juniors were also hit One of these had a slight flesh wound of the arm but the other two were both severely wounded In one of these the bullet had entered the middle of the third sacral vertebra and had emerged through the abdomen two inches above the spine of the pubes and two inches to the left of the middle line There wasno symptom of peritonitis so no opera tion was performed Recovery was uninterrupted save for a curious attack of localised pain with rapid pulse and pyrexia three weeks later which however passed away in a day or two A temporary incontinence of faeces suggested injury of the sacral nerves where the bullet hadtraversed the spine but this trouble lasted only a few days Boer Bullets As to the bullets used by the Boers the majority are certainly Mauser though not only have we seen several wounds caused by expanding bullets but Mr CuthbertWallace found at Winberg a large number of expanding bullets of many varie ties and it is curious that in some commandoes at least the use of them is increasingly common Shell wounds are very few Wounded Boers We have had six wounded Boers amongst our patients all of them Free Staters from the De Wets Dorp commandolarge limbed wellbuilt men One of them had a fractured femur and another a bullet through the knee with partial paralysis j of the parts supplied by the external popliteal nerve but there was no appreciable difference between the wounds inflicted by the LeeMetford bullets and the Mauser Four or five men have had typhoid fever as a complication of their wounds but the latter have done quite well in spite of this The Climate The climate at present is excellent The days are bright clear and sunny and the air is dry The temperature falls suddenly directly after sunset which is now at about 5 pm and the nights are cold and often frostywe had half an inch of ice in our buckets last week It is said by the people here Athat enteric fever always stops when the frost begins so it is to be hoped that this will be the case again MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA Mr BurdettCouttss Allegations The Times on the June 27th published a letter dated Cape town May 29th from Mr W BurdettCoutts in which he alleges that the medical arrangements in South Africa have failed to keep pace with the epidemic of typhoid fever which has caused a very large number of cases of illness especially among the troops in and about Bloemfontein He gives a graphic and very distressing account of the overcrowded con dition of a field hospital used as a stationary hospital in Bloemfontein The letter as it stands would certainly convey the impres sion and as a matter of fact has conveyed the impression that the deplorable condition under which Mr BurdettCoutts described cases of typhoid fever to have been treated in this field hospital were typical of those to which the majority of the patients who have been treated at Bloemfontein have been subjected Mr BurdettCouttss allegations the gravity of which he states he fully apprc cates undoubtedly demand the mesv sean hng eximinato With no desire to condone or June 30 1900MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA Ubjmx ipi excuse such deficiencies as he alleges to have existed we may point out that Mr BardettCouttss statements are in some re spects contrary to information in our possession He makes no mention though his letter is dated May 29th of the three large military general hospitals which as we stated last week were in full working order early in May and had apparently been taken into use some time during the previous month if not earlier There is no doubt that there has been a great deal of typhoid fever in the army especially among the forces engaged north of the Orange River Mr Fripp the Chief Surgeon of the Im perial Yeomanry Hospital in a letter dated June 4th informs us that he had shortly before visited Bloemfontein and Kroonstad In Bloemfontein there were at that time over 5000 sick most of whom were suffering from enteric fever  while in Kroonstad the three hotels the Town Hall and the church had been converted into hospitals even the billiard tables being requisitioned to accommodate cases of enteric fever He adds that as the railway had been opened the SurgeonGeneral was engaged in rapidly pushing up adequate hospital accommodation The train in which Mr Fripp re turned brought down 241 sick to Bloemfontein where they were admitted into one of the general hospitals bringing the number of sick it contained  to the huge total of 1800 Mr Fripp describes the water supply all over the country as ex tremely bad  Water he says  in the small streams at the bottom of the river beds is often very muddy Dead horses are generally to be seen in the streams and they are never above the strong suspicion of being typhoid infected It is impossible for all water that is required for drinking pur poses to be boiled  there is not fuel enough Sir William Thomson writing from Bloemfontein early in May stated in a letter published in the British Medical Journal of June 2nd that there were between 3000 and 4000 sick in the town and that of these 1200 were cases of enteric fever He stated that the three general hospitals were crowded that several of the public buildings were utilised for the accommodation of the sick and that there were in the town in addition the Irish the Portland and the Langman Hospitals Died of Disease in South Africa Week Ending Total

the weeks ending April 14th and June 2nd The amount of sicknes3 in the forces in South Africa has been large about 7 per cent but this is less than in previous campaigns The exact figures are not available but the above table compiled from the official returns issued by the War Office shows the number of officers and men who have died of disease in South Africa from the middle of February to June 23rd The number of deaths attributed to enteric fever is not distinguished but there can be no doubt that a very large proportion have been due to enteric fever and a large number also to dysentery It will be remembered that Cronje surrendered on February 27th and it will be seen that a sudden rise in the number of deaths from disease occurred between three and four weeks later Mr Watson Cheyne attributed the great amount of typhoid fever preva lent in Bloemfontein at the end of March and the beginning of April to infection by the polluted water of the Modder river which the troops were compelled to drink during the time for which Cronje remained in his laager and Mr Bowlby whose letter is printed above appears to entertain a similar opinion though he speaks also of other infected places It will be seen also that there was another sudden rise in the number of deaths from disease in the weeks ending May 19th and 26th  this was some seven or eight weeks after the water works of Bloemfontein were occupied by the enemy and the water supply cut off Whether these two circumstances are to be connected or not it will be as yet premature to con jecture  Letter from Mr Treyes We are indebted to Mr Trves for the following letter which he has written in response to our request for his opinion  SirI have read Mr BurdettCouttss letter in the Times of to day and am shocked and surprised at the report he fur nishes I left Natal in March some time after the relief of Lady smith and the account I gave on my return to England of the work of the Army Medical Service in Natal was based  upon my experience up to the period of my departure Mr BurdettCoutts comments upon this account as if it  dealt with events which were to be in the future rather than with events which have happened in the past To every word I have said as to the excellence of the army medical arrangements in Natal I adhere most absolutely It is difficult to believe that a department which stood with such credit the exceptional strain of the Naial campaign can have suddenly exhibited the alarming collapse depicted by the writer of the letter in question My experience had in duced me to think that the organisation of the Army Medical Service was sound and good that the general scheme of work and of administration was efficient and that the lavish arrangements planned by the DirectorGeneral were carried out by his subordinates in a liberal thorough and business like manner There was no evidence of the intervention of red tape nor of hindrance by petty formalities and the hospital work was not only not hampered by other departments but was helped in every way with the heartiest readiness I cannot think that our sick have been treated with  neg lect and  inhumanity as Mr BurdettCoutts asserts Instead of neglecting their patients the surgeons I met worked with heart and soul sparing themselves in no par ticular and of the untiring and unselfish devotion of the nurses I have already spoken This war has been a war of surprises The casualties have been higher than the gloomiest ever dreamt of and there was no reason to anticipate that the outbreak of enteric fever would assume the enormous proportions it has assumed The circumstances of war unfortunately render an immense amount of suffering and distress absolutely unavoidable and the difficulties of furnishing adequate supplies from a far distant base are extreme I left South Africa with the impression that nothing more could have been done to mitigate the sufferings of the sickt and wounded than had been done when a temperate regard for the circumstances of war was kept in mind The Army Medical Service can lay no claim to the gift of prophecy nor to the power of anticipating the future but so far as any reasonable foresight can go the department seems to have done all that in fairness could have been expected of it Mr BurdettCoutts will no doubt substantiate the points detailed in his report but his preliminary account is conveyed in language which so savours of the theatrical that it fails to carry with it an overwhelming conviction Mobile field hospitals if they have to do the work they are intended to do cannot take beds with them It is better for a typhoid patient to lie upon a blanket and waterproof sheet on the groundas Mr BurdettCoutts describesthan to be hurried helterskelter to the base No human being can tell how the progress of an epidemic may proceed nor how the numbers of the sick will be distri buted Preparations may be made for 1000 and the admis sions may not reach 10 It is impossible to avoid overcrowd ing at times and equally impossible to provide in every I6i2 mlSSJASSOCIATION INTELLIGENCEJune 3ot ioog detail for emergencies which no reasonable foresight could anticipate That our gallant soldiers should suffer is deplorable indeed but the blame must fall rather upon the miserable fortunes of war than upon a department which has spared neither men nor money nor care nor devotion in a work which has assumed dimensions out of all proportion to that anticipated at the outset The seat of war is at least three weeks distant from theseat of supplies and in those three weeks a region free from disease may become the seat of a desperate epidemic The move ments of the troops cannot be exactly foretold It would be tetter for the country to be flooded with doctors and nurses rather than that the soldiers should suffer but it is quite im possible that the medical arrangements can at a time of war overthrow all those circumstances of transport and supply upon which the conduct of the campaign depends Unfortunately in war the war comes first but I should imagine that in no campaign has there ever been such solicitous and successful care for the sickYours faithfully Frederick Trves ASSOCIATION INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL NOTICE

THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY FIELD HOSPITAL We have received from Mr Charles Stonham Officer Com manding and Chief Surgeon Imperial Yeomanry Field Hos pital a further letter dated Pretoria October 23rd 1900 in the course of which he gives the following details with regard to further wanderings of the hospital  I El The March to Barberton On reaching Pretoria on August 28th we sent our ambulances on to the Irish Hospital established in the Palace of Justice and camped near the racecourse We had lost many transport animals and those still alive were worn out with long marches and scanty rations The Field Hospital and Bearer Company combined had to requisition for seventy fresh animals but were only able to draw ten sixty being the total number allowed for the whole brigade All units were in this respect as badly off The day after our arrival in Pretoria Major Hale and I went to No 3 Model School Hospital commanded by Major Ford RAMC to which we had lent our detachment for the time being and made all arrangements for the detachment ex changing one or two sick men and providing for the sending home of most of the St John Ambulance men who were time expired We drew a few stores and changed a couple of carts so that we should be ready to march at once when orders ar rived For these we had not long to wait as we received marching orders for the following day On August 30th we struck camp at 7 am  marched through Pretoria at 9 a m passing the recently established Yeomanry Branch Hospital in the grounds of Becketts House at Sunny side It looked most businesslike with everything in full swing orderlies and nurses coming to the railings to see us pass On the opposite side of the load was the Langmans Hospital On September ist we arrived at Balmoral having camped the night before two miles south of Bronkhurst Spruit We had to pass along the road where our animals had perished in such numbers during the storm of July 25th26th The stench was abominable and nauseating We passed through Middel burg on September 3rd and sent our sick to the hospital there We camped at Wonderfontein on September 4th Next day as we were inspanning we heard heavy gun fire to the northwest of us and after marching about three miles our artillery and mounted troops with two ambulances under Major Hale were ordered back The Boers under Com mandant Trichardt had attacked a party of Canadians guard ing the railway but had been beaten off Our ambulances took five wounded men from the Canadian camp to Wonderfon tein railway station to await a train for Middelburg On September 6th we joined General Frenchs division at Carolina and rested hre till September 9th when the division marched ioto the hills in the direction of Barberton Major Hae and Mr Green with two ambulances followed Mahons cavalry the rest going with the main convoy About 1030 a m our advanced guns engaged the enemy and the convoy parked at the foot of a hill on which two of our guns were placed The guns soon drove the enemy from the oppo site hill  the action was most exciting especially at the finish when the mounted Boers broke cover and made up the hill we had been shelling as hard as they could go under a perfect hail of shell from the battery The division now ad vanced crossed the hill we had been shelling and camped about 8 oclock in the valley Our casualties in this action were 5 wounded  one man shot through the head died in our hospital on September 12th The next morning we were fairly in the mountains  the roads were very bad broken by numerous drifts over the winding Komati River On Sep tember 12th we camped at the foot of Roodehoogte an exceed ingly steep pass about half a mile long and the remainder of that day and the two next following were taken up in get ting the troops and convoy over the pass Our turn to ascend came on September 14th and the next day we marched to the top of the Devils Chute about 7500 or 8000 feet above sea level from which there is an extensive and beautiful view with Barber ton about 20 miles distant The Chute is a winding road about 3 miles long descending about 2500 or 3000 feet to the lower but still hilly and broken ground Many waggons and animals which had come to grief in the descent bore witness to its difficulties Our mules were now thoroughly done up  we had lost so many that even after inspanning our horses our teams were reduced to six animals and we only just managed to creep into Barberton on Sep tember 17th when we sent our sick to the Boer hospital This march to Barberton will certainly rank as one of the great marches of the campaign  and the Boers and indeed the English residents there thought it impossible for us to enter Barberton with our heavy guns and convoy But French pushing on and arriving two days before he was ex pected caused the Boers to beat a hasty retreat leaving large quantities of stores and over forty engines At Barberton we were detained for lack of transport till October 2nd At Barberton We obtained supplies and a few fresh vegetables which were very welcome as we began to feel the absence of the latter severely indeed this is one of the chief drawbacks to long marches through absolutely barren country Unfortunately there was absolutely no forage to be ob tained and our transport animals had to pick op a living as best they could on the veld Needless to say they died daily A few days before we left a small quantity of forage was issued  had it not been for this most of the poor animals would have died From Barberton to Machadodorp Gn October ist we received orders to march the following morning as we were to proceed by the Devils Kantoor We were only to take such waggons as we could find full teams for We left 2 officers and 35 men with 7 waggons who camped near the station These were sent on by train and we found them waiting when we got to Machadodorp On October 2nd Major Hale Dr Green and I with 28 men moved off with 10 carts after passing a most disagreeable night in consequence of the very high wind and perpetual dust storms marched 18 miles and camped at the North De Kaap River The rest of the column going 4 miles further on During the night a series of heavy thunderstorms com menced and lasted practically without intermission for eighteen hours Two men in the ammunition column were killed by lightning and others injured Some mules were killed On October 3rd we commenced the ascent of the Kantoor by a very bad road in parts excessively steep wind ing up the mountain for about seven miles This day we did about four miles in pouring rain accompanied by heavy thunder and lightning The next two days were occupied in getting the waggons up From the top of the Kantoor a mag nificent view of the mountains surrounding the low ground in which Barberton lies was obtained On October 6th we reached Godwan River Station and had again to cut down our convoy as there was another hill to be ascended at Waterval Onder which according to accounts we received was worse than anything we had yet done We left Mr Green wilh all the baggage and what little stores we hadtwo carts and all the men but eight to go on to Machadodorp by train Major Hale and I with eight men and the rest of the waggons empty except for kits marched to Nooitgedacht through a beautiful valley which had it not been for the wind and heavy dust storms would have been most enjoyable On arriving at Waterval Onder about midday on October 8th we saw the hill of which we had received such terrible accounts and were agreeably surprised to find that there was really nothing for midable about itindeed in the afternoon we marched up it without difficulty with our usual ten span of mules The fol lowing day we reached Maohadodorp where we found the rest of our men and waggons who had preceded us by train Frenchs division and some of Bullers troops were at Machadodorp making a very big camp On October nth we received orders to cross to the north of the line at day break and take over the sick from the field hospital which was to replace us in Mahons brigade This in view of the fact that the yeomanry volunteers colonials and reservists were being sent down looked like an early return home and although we were sorry not to accompany General Manon as IS8 iSIl8 RETURN OF HOSPITALS FROM SOUTH APRICA TNov a4 1900 we had been with him for three months yet we were all deighted at the prospect before

Forces FRERE CAMP IT was from Frere Camp that the army under General Buller started for the Tugela River Frere is merely a station on the line of rail which traverses Natal and as it consists only of some four houses it can hardly be dignified by the name of hamlet These few singlestorey houses had been very thoroughly looted by the Boers and in one of them the stationmasters housethe General had his headquar ters Frere is simply a specka corrugated iron oasisin the vast undulating plains of the veld On the way to Lady smith are a few large kopjes from any one of which the line of the Tugela River can be seen with the hills beyond occupied by the Boer entrenchments and over them again the hills which dominate Ladysmith There was no shade of any kind and as the weather was exceptionally hot the camp was not precisely comfortable The inconvenience of a continued sunglare was intensified by constant clouds of brown dust and by the scarcity of water On the other hand the evenings were cool and the early mornings delightful The river which is reputed to  run  through Frere had long since ceased to run The water was retained by certain dams and the pools thus formed were not over numerous The water was the colour of peasoup and when in a glass was semiopaque and of a faint brownish colour It soon blocked a Berkefeld filter the pencil of which had to be cleaned after each water bottle had been pumped full The filtered water was pleasant enough to the taste In the lowest pool immediately above the iron railway bridge which had been blown up by the Boers Tommy Atkins could bathe in what seerned to be a lightcoloured mud Here also he washed his socks and his shirts We came up to FrereI and my two nurseswith No 4 Stationary Field Hospital This hospital was under the very able direction of Major Kirkpatrick and did splendid service The other officers were Major Mallins and Lieutenant Simson of the RAMC than whom none could be more efficient We reached the camp on the Monday before the battle when it was reputed that 30000 men were under canvas A camp of this size of necessity presented an endless scene of bustle and movement Nothing seemed to be at rest but the interminable array of white tents and the rows of baggage waggons Cavalry would be moving in one direction and infantry in another Here a mounted patrol would be riding out or a couple of scouts coming in Gallopers would be seen in all direc tions and everywhere would be a struggling team of oxen or of mules enveloped in clouds of dust and urged on by sweating men and strange oaths The camp during the day lay dry dusty parched and restless under a blazing sun but at night there was a cool wind and cheery camp fires and a darkness which blotted out the dusty roads the driedup river the dismal piles of stores and the general picture of a camp in a desert of baked earth Every night a search light was at work sending despatches to Ladysmith and almost every morning could be heard the Boer guns thundering over that unhappy place Tommy Atkins looked very smart in his khaki suit when leaving Waterloo Station or when embarking at Southampton but at Frere he showed the effects of wear and his tunic his belt his pouches his boots and his face had all toned down to one uniform tint of dirt colour HeVwas of the earth earthy Even his brown face and red neck were well powdered with the common dust but nothing seemedto have blotted out his cheerfulness and his determination to make the best of even a camp on the veld BEFORE THE BATTLE On Wednesday the army began to move forward to Chieveley and on Thursday the whole camp had nearly vanished aad little remained but smouldering fires of camp refuse the inevitable dust the inevitable sun and the inevitable Kaffir From a kopje some three miles beyond therethe kopje from which the Boers fired upon the illfated armoured trainthe new camp at Chieveley could be seen The baggage train which followed the army was eight miles in length This train was made up mainly of waggons drawn by teams of oxeneighteen to each waggon The last bearer company was well out of sight in the new camp before the last waggonscarrying pontoonshad started The course of this enormous caravan across the veld was marked by a line of brown dust which gave one the idea that the very road was smoking under this unwonted burden From the kopje we could see the firing of the great naval guns and the clouds of dust sent up by the exploding shells and now and then from the weary road would come an attenuated sound which was all that reached us of the shrill yells of the nigger drivers whose dustdried throats gave out noises like the shrieks of parrots DURINGX THE BATTLE On Friday morning No 4 Stationary Hospital movc up hurriedly to Chieveley To our numbers had been added two Netley sisters whose skill devotion and unselfishness were soon taxed to the utmost On the way up it was evident that the battle was raging The roar of the big gans was incessant and rising above their solemn boom was the sharp irritable crack of the quickfiring ordnance When I reached Chieveley Station where the hospital was to be pitched a message arrived asking me to go down to the field of battle at once I went down in a mule waggon immediately Our hospital was about three and three quarter miles from the Naval Hill on which our big guns were pitched Close behind the ridge formed by this hill were four field hospitals The scene presented at this spot was beyond description The men were coming in as fast as the ambulances and bearers could bring them Some were dead some were dying all were parched with thirst and baked and blistered with heat The men were lying on all sides on stretchersamidst tents piles of rifles accoutrements battered helmets and blood stained tunics It was a sight no one would wish to see again and the blazing sun added to the miseries of all Some 8oo wounded were passed through the field hospitals and dealt with by sixteen surgeons Those who harshly criticise the Army Medical Department should have seenm the work done on that memorable Friday on the Naval Hill before Colenso No work could have been done better The equipment was good the arrangements elaborated and the officers worked on hour after hour without rest or food under the most trying possible conditions No greater strain could have fallen upon a department and all concerned met the brunt of it valiantly and well One could not be other than proud of ones profession The system of dealing with the wounded had been very carefully worked out by the Principal Medical Officer Colonel Gallwey CB and to his foresight and preparation the perfect working of the hospitals on the day of the battle is due In addition to the ordinary bearer companies Colonel Gallwey had or ganised a volunteer ambulance corps of some 2000 tmen disposed in the proportion of twelve men to a stre cher It was intended that these bearers should convey the more seriously wounded from the field so that they might be spared the jolting of the ambulance waggons over the somewhat rough ground Not only did the bearers do this and so save infinite suffering but all Friday night and Saturday they were carrying the graver cases from the field hospitals to the stationary hospital at Chieveley So 220 IJOUNA  MR TREVES ON THE BATTLE OF COLENSO JAN 27 1900 admirably was the stretcher work done that not a single wounded man was left upon the field after dark on Friday AFTER THE BATTLE Oar hospital at Chieveley was crammed to its utmost and ery many wounded men had to lie all night in the open Fortunately the nights on Friday and Saturday were very fine and there was a bright moon The work on Friday and Saturday was the heaviest I have ever experienced and we all suffered a good deal from thirst The nurses worked not only all day but also all night Some hundreds of wounded soldiers will have reason to remember their devotion that day and how well they succeeded in rendering a little more tolerable a state ol misery which was horrible to contemplate IN THE DONGA After a heavyafternoon on thefield I returned toChieveley Field Hospital in the evening but had hardly got in when a galloper arrived to ask me to see Lieutenant Roberts who had just been brought back I returned at once with a full equipment of instruments and much regret that that valiant soldier was from the first quite beyond the reach of surgery In addition to a penetrating wound of the abdo men his forearm was shattered by a Mauser and his knee wounded by a shell He was pulseless I slept outside his tent that night and saw him up to Chieveley on Satur 4day morning He never rallied nor regained a pulse and zdied on Saturday at midnight Before he was brought in he had been lying for seven hours in the sun in a donga Here he was attended to by Major Babtie RAMC who rode into the donga through a hail of bullets and whose horse was killed under him Major Babtie kept by the many wounded men in the donga until the battle was over and as he alone had water in his water bottle he doled out water to each man in a minim measure i drachm to each The courage and daring of Major Babtie on this occasion calls for some recognition from the medical profession if not from the military authorities THE HEAT On Sunday we had to leave Chieveley as the hospital was within reach of the Boer shells We therefore retired to our previous pitch at Frere The hospital tents at Chieveley were admirably situated but the work was much hampered by want of water The temperature on Friday and Saturday was up to IOO F in the shade On Monday the temperature rose to IO40 F in the shade A clinical thermometer in a bag and under cover of a tent registered 0450 F DEATH OF CAPTAIN HUGHES One very sad episode of the battle was the death of Captain Hughes RAMC Surgeon to General Buller He was riding to the aid of the wounded when he was shot through the root of the neck and died in 30 minutes He was an able surgeon a charming companion and a most amiable and popular man He was beloved by everyone in his corps and had a distinguished career be fore him THE HO3PITAL TRAINS AND SHIPS Themethod of dealing with the wounded in the Natal Field Force is as follows The railwaya single lineis open as far as Chieveley and on it are two admirably equipped hospital trains in charge of the indefatigable and everobliging Major BrazierCreagh RAMC The hospital train was on the field before daybreak on Saturday morning and was soon filled with wounded Some few of these were landed at the No 4 Stationary Field Hospital at Chieveley the rest were taken on to Estcourt and Maritz burg At both these towns but especially at Maritzburg there is very excellent hospital accommodation The base hospital alone at MaritzburK can take in IIOO patients and besides there is the large military hospital at the Col lege Greys Hospital and the hospital for volunteers estab lished at the Legislative Assembly From Maritzburg the patients are sent down to Durban by the hospital train and are then conveyed to Cape Town by the hospital ship Spartan which is under the charge of Major Woodhouse RAMC From the careful examina tion I made of her when I boarded herat Durban I should think she was the bestequipped and bestmanaged hospi tal ship afloat Colonel Gallweys organisation has now been tested to the utmost and has been proved to be efficient and admirable Those in England who have friends among the army in Natal may rest assured that the wounded are well looked after and that the arrangements for their comfort leave little to be desired The wounded placed upon the hospital train by the Naval Hill below Chieveley could haveas soon as they were placed in their berthsiced soda water and whisky iced milk hot soup or even champagne and seltzer It is no matter of wonder that Major Brazier Creagh is proud of his train to which he has devoted so much labour and thought The strain of the work at Durban falls upon Major McCormack RAMC who has charge of the base depot medical stores and whoafter weeks of hard work has brought his department to a perfect degree of businesslike efficiency MAUSER BULLET WOUNDS The great majority of the wounds are by Mauser bullets some few are due to fragments of shell and a still less number to shrapnel The Mauser bullet is a very merciful one and in no instance have I met with a case in which the head of the bullet had been cut off as had been asserted by some The damage done by the Mauser depends mainly upon the range At I500 to 2000 yards it penetrates like a needle At 5oo yards or less it will smash a femur or a humerus to fragments When a bone is fractured the bulletif retainedis generally found to be much dis torted or broken up into many fragments The shell generally peels off the leaden core As an instance of the fine hitting of the Mauser I may mention a case from the armoured train in which the bullet went through the middle phalanges of the ring and little fingers making four small wounds which healed kindly and neatly The two bones were fractured but the man recovered with sound union and mobile joints On the other hand I have seen a fracture of the humerus in which the bone was broken into twentythree small frag ments Many gunshot fractures of the thigh heal by first intention ABDOMINAL WOUNDS The point of entry of the Mauser is very smalloften as Tommy says like a bugbite it is not difficult to over look The point of exit is also often very small but is more apt to be slitlike Several patients have been shot through the abdomen without inconvenience following In some of these the bowel has been penetrated as shown by blood in the motions The hole made in the bowel by the Mauser is very small and can be closed by from three to five Lemberts sutures Several penetrating wounds of the liver and kidney have been followed by no symptoms One distinguished officer had a shrapnel bullet pass through his liver and kidney He had little collapse and beyond some temporary tympanites and hEematuria he had no trouble of any kind BULLET WOUNDS OF THE HEAD AND SPINE In several instances the bullet has passed through the brain without causing marked symptoms and perfect re covery has followed For example a bullet entered near the vertex passed through the brain hard palate and buc cal cavity and escaped at the root ofithe neck on the oppo site side No discomfort followed except headache and 3ome strabismus Speaking generally operations upon the skull for gunshot wound have done exceptionally well JAN 27 19oo THE MEDICAL SITUATION IN CAPE COLONY  Bntrve 221 and such operations have been numerous I met with 4 cases of paraplegia on Saturday the bullet having in each case apparently passed through the cord BULLET WOUNDS OF THE EXTREMITIES Amputations have been comparatively few I have seen a Mauser go through the centre of the patella and out at the centre of the popliteal space and lead to no trouble in the joint In another case the bullet went through the popliteal space from side to side and left the bone and joint untouched but led to an arteriovenous aneurysm BULLET WOUNDS OF THE CHEST After penetrating wounds of the lung there may be n1o symptoms beyond an immediate heemoptysis which iS not repeated In other instances there has been surgical emphysema or haemothorax apneumothorax and an exam ple or two of empyema On the whole gunshot wounds of the chest do well Some cases are hard to understand as for example one in which the bullet entered above the clavicle and came out on the inner side of the opposite thigh there being no symptom except temporary shock THE FIELD DRESSING The field dressing carried by each soldier answers its purpose admirably Tommy has a great regard for it and takes every care that he has it on him THE SPIRIT OF THE WOUNDED On all sides there is evidence that our soldiers behaved splendidly on the field and I can say that when brought back wounded they were plucky patient and uncomplain ing Their unselfishness was many times very marked An orderly was bringing some water to a wounded man lying on the ground near me He was shot through the abdomen and he could hardly speak owing to the dryness of his mouth but he said  Take it to my pal first he is worse hit than me This generous lad died next morning but his pal got through and is doing well FREDERICK TREVES FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT THE MEDICAL SITUATION AT THE BASE IN CAPE COLONY Capetown December 80th 1899 THE BAE HOSPITALS AFTER LORD METHUENs ACTIONS THE newsthe rather scanty newsthat we get from England chiefly refers at present to the additional reinforcements that are coming out With military matters I am in no way con cerned but it is at least possible that the idea may obtain at home that the noncombatant departments may also stand in need of further augmentation and it is tolerably safe to assume that to the medical branch thoughts will be turned It maysave disappointment to many if the medical situation is explained At the moment of writing there are in round figures some IIoo patients in the three base hospitals No I and No 2 as the readers of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL are aware are at Wynberg and No 3 atRondebesch The latter hospital has rather over Ioo cases which were brought down a day or two ago in the hospital ship Spartan from Natal No 3 therefore has at present more medical and nursing staff power than is required It is likely to fill up gradually and without any sudden strain being thrown on it After the engagements in the neighbourhood of the Modder River in which General Lord Methuens force took part there was for a time very great pressure on the base hospitals Nos I and 2 The nursing staff was hardly up to the strength calculated to meet such a sudden and serious strain In some respects the hospitals were incomplete thus the operating theatre of No 2 is still a marquee tent the building being still in the hands of the workmen Not withstanding Lthe severe pressure and in spite of the fact that in minor details the absolately smooth working that can only be looked for when the machine has been running for a little time was hard to secure these base hospitals met the emergency with comparative ease Hard work was entailed but that was precisely what every member of the staff was burning with anxiety to give and they asked for nothing better Meanwhile No 4 Hospital at present under ordErs to proceed to Natal has not as yet been called into requisi tion and there are two additional hospital ships the Lisnore and the Nubia which have been fitted here There is there fore a large margin allowed The wounded at all the three base hospitals broadly speaking do well and a large number of convalescents will shortly be ready to leave On all these grounds therefore it does not seem probable that any increase of the medical or nursing staff will be called for A WARNING TO VOLUNTEER NURSES Yet every steamer from England appears to bring ladies who seek in vain to obtain nursing employment in the hos pitals To such as are unacquainted with the methods of a military hospital and its manner of working the nursing staff appears inadequate Judging only by their experience when they have any of civil hospitals there appear abundant openings for more women workers The outflow of sympathy is strong and it seems almost cruel to point out that the resentment felt when applications are declined is highly un reasonable The long and short of it is that the RAMC is not in any need of more nursing power Were there any desire to appoint extra nurses of which there is not the slightest indication it is possible that the claims of the many nurses who under normal conditions exercise their vocation at places like Kimberley and Johannesburg would be first considered Among these are many fullytrained nurses fully qualified to do any work to which they might be set Their lot is a hard one for prices at Capetown are high and civil employment is not easily obtained No one here would doubt the readiness with which the nurses at home would volunteer for service but they are not wanted At some future date the question of the em ployment of nurses to a greater extent than now obtains in military hospitals may come again to the front and the ex perience derived from this campaign will be of much value but this sort of question is one that it would be most im proper to discuss at present and most unprofitable No sane person would seriously argue however strong the views he held that any grave change of system should be made during a time of stress and trial The feeling that animates so many at home is just as strong at Capetown Everyone is desirous of giving practical aid of being useful in some capacity It is to be feared that a for midable amount of thankless work devolves on the officials of the medical department in answering the numerous applica tions made WNo I AND 2 HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG The hospitals at Wynberg are very easily accessible from Capetown and when strong southeasterly winds blow Wyn berg is a much pleasanter place than Capetown It has been found necessary to restrict rigidly the granting of passes to the hospitals which otherwise would have been inundated with visitors many of whom would have gone out of pure curiosity It is not easy to convince people that the essential business of a hospital is to get the patients well as quickly as possible and move them away to make room foir others and that anything which interferes in the least degree with this end is highly undesirable No 3 HOSPITAL AT RONDEBOSCH No 3 Hospital charmingly situated at Rondebosch with a magnificent view of Table Mountain was opened on December 24th for active work some ioo wounde4 and sick brought down in the hospital ship Spartan being the first occupants The only objection that can be made against the site chosen is that it is rather expoeed to wind ihe trees that surround the tents are at some distance The sandy soil gives but poor hold for tent pegs and if the  Cape Doctor  blows with great force there may be anxious moments The water supply is abundant and good and the Water Company has undertaxen to keep the roads watered When the tent The War In

stay at Capetown I had an opportunity of seeing Nos I and 2 General Hospitals established at Wynberg in full work A large number of wounded and a fewremark ably fewsick had been brought down from the field hospitals at the Modder River and Orange River and the staff were busily engaged Later on some i8o were brought in the hospital ship Spartan from Natal and accommodated at No 3 General Hospital at Rondebosch the officers being taken into the permanent hospital forming part of No I There is no need for me to describe the hospitals as your readers have already had fall accounts of them but a few impressions derived from a study of the cases may prove of interest Through the courtesy of Colonel Anthonisz Colonel Duke and Colonel Wood in charge respectively of the three hospitals I was enabled to study the cases minutely and the RAMC officers and civil surgeons vied with each other in drawing attention to all the more remarkable cases It is of course early to speak positively about patients who have only been a short time under treatment but the general impression of their progress is decidedly favourable The sanitary effi ciency of both hospitals is so far unquestionable and the water supply good and abundant At present the dry season is firmly established and the doors and windows everywhere in huts and tents alike are perpetually open to an extent indeed that at first rather amazes those unaccustomed to the climate and unaware of the slight risk that appears to be incurred by operating on patients and dressing wQunds almost in the open air Wounds inflicted by the Mauser bullet heal very kindly as favourably indeed as we are assured by those who ought to know do wounds caused by the LeeMetford If a Mauser bullet has merely inflicted a flesh wound through the shoulder arm or thigh healing throughout by primary union can with certainty be looked for It is uncommon to find any portions of clothing buttons etc carried into the wound In some cases however this does happen and I was assured that in not a few that came under treatment at the field hospitals at the Modder River portions of the Highlanders kilts were embeceded in the wounds and were removed WOUNDS BY THE SPORTING MAUSER  BWLLET AND BY RICOCHET The vast majority of the wounds are inflicted by the Mauser bullet properthat is the familiar conical bullet sheathed completely in nickel But wounds inflicted in our men by three other kinds of bullets have to be taken into account The sporting Mauser bullet is of the same size and weight as the other but the nickel does not entirely enclose the lead being deficient at the fore part for about half an inch The posterior point of the lead bullet being enclosed and tightly gripped in its nickel sheath the lead on striking any hard sub stancebone for examplespreads out or  mushrooms as it is usually expressed This involves much laceration of soft parts There is yet a bullet occasionally used which is practically identical with the  Dumdum and in a very few instances the ordinary  Express  bullet has been extracted To this list shouldbe added the Mauser bullet as aricochet shot Not many of these are met with Some that I have seen show bending of the bullet or it may be twisted on its long axis The nickel top may be intact but the nickel sheath will pro bably be split and stripped off the lead core to a greater or less extent se that the bullet resembles a moth with closely folded wings Such missiles would be likely to deflect in their course and they would obviously lacerate ttie parts through which they passed An intact Mauser bullet nearly spent may be twisted and bent and the nickel sheath split in a somewhat similar fashion if it strikes a hard bone In such cases the entrance wound is small and there is probably no exit wound thus showing that the bullet was of normal shape when entering SHELL AND SHRAPNEL WOUNDS A few of the patients have injuries from shell splinters one or two injuries from the i I6 Nordenfelt projectile and once in a way wounds inflicted by shrapnel are met with THE SMALL PROPORTION OF SEPTIC CASES It must be borne in mind that all the patients in the base hospitals have travelled far When fit to be sent down from the field hospitals in the western frontier or when the pressure necessitated their being moved away they had a journey of at least twentyeight hours in the hospital train to Wynberg then the drive up to the base hospital is about a mile Wounded sent down from Natal have their journey to Durban and then the transit in the hospital ship to Capetown After that they have about half an hours journey by train from the docks to Wynberg or Rondebosch followed in either case by a drive of about one mile If the conditions therefore are con sidered and it be remembered that many of the men had lain for hours on the field of battle before the ubiquitous bearer companies had access to them it is not surprising that in a few cases the wounds had become septic before they reached Wynberg Once there however and at rest the septic condition as a rule rapidly mended At one time dur ing my stay at Capetown there were about Iioo patients in hospital The proportion of septic cases was marvellously insignificant THE SURGICAL WORK AT THE FRONT The mere mention of septicity seems to imply criticism if not censure Nothing could be further from justice The plain fact is that one and all are agreed that never perhaps in the history of warfare has better work been done at the front by the Medical Department than in this campaign The bearer companies and ambulance department have already received the praise so well their due I desire to bear witness also to the evidence of the excellent surgical work done at the front examples in proof of which will be cited later on NATURE OF WOUNDS IN RELATION TO THE NATURE OF THE FIGHT It is noteworthy that the different engagements were to a considerable extent characterised by particular classes of in juries Thus at the action of Belmont when our troops were for a great part of the fighting hours on their feet the cases of wounds of the trunk and in particular of compound fracture of the thigh were numerous At Magersfontein especially wounds of the head and shoulder and long tracking wounds were in the ascendant These facts seem to imply not only good shooting on the part of the Boers but also opportunity for deliberate aim Wounds about the shoulder usually the left were common and I saw quite a number where the bullet had entered near the acromion process and passed out through the axilla Many of these were complicated with nerve injury and of much interest and I shall write more at length on them in my next letter WOUND OF KNEE BY LEEENFIELD BULLET CONVALESCENCE FRESH INJURIES AMPUTATION The following are the notes of a case in which a Lee Enfield bullet wound of the kneejoint appeared likely to do well when an accident altered the progre s of the case very much for the worse The patient was a field cornet wounded at Elandslaagte by a LeeEnfield bullet and taken prisoner It entered the left popliteal space and passed out through the patella fracturing that bone transversely about the middle The wound did well and he was sent round to Capetown and moved to No I Hospital at Wynberg He was a big heavy man weighing probably i6st or i7st but not very healthylooking in fact his appearance rather suggested renal disease and the action of the heart was feeble Wiring the patella was suggested but not performed He recovered sufficiently with a movable kneejoint to leave his bed and to move about on crutches One day however he fell tearing the anterior wound open Extravasation occurred into the knee and suppuration follwed When I saw him about December 22nd 344 j  1 MILITARY SURGERY IN SOUTH AFRICA FEB IO r90Em openings had been made in various places about the joint and there was cedema of the back of the thigh The knee was flexed and acutely painful He was very hysterical and though at first afraid of chloroform would not afterwards allow the dressings to be changed without an ansesthetic The temperature was irregular high and obviously septic He has wasted having probably 10st 35t or 48t in weight About December 24th the kneejoint was freely laid open and irrigated commencing erosion of cartilages was observed The temperature improved for a few days but then began to rise and grow irregular again He asked for amputation and this was done by Mr Makins about December 27th in the middle third of the thigh The afterprogress was satisfac tory and the prospect of rapid recovery almost certain SOME IMPRESSIONS OF MILITARY SURGERY IN SOUTH AFRICA By G H MAKINS FRCS ConsultingSurgeon to the Forces in South Africa ITHE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THE WOUNDS INFLICTED BY THE MAUSER RIFLE WOUNDS inflicted by the Mauser rifle possess very special characteristics due in part to the velocity attained by in part to the smallness of the bullet These characteristics are in a great measure shared by the wounds produced by the Lee Metford but the slightly greater size and weight together with the blunter extremity of the Lee Metford bullet give rise to a slightly more serious injury than that resulting from the regulation Mauser In all essentials however the wounds produced by the two rifles may be regarded as identi cal in nature The first striking physical peculiarity is the direct course of the wound track due to the fact that the bullet by reason of its small size and the great velocity at which it travels is never materially diverted in its course through the body indeed there is no reason why the entire length of the body should not be traversed by a bullet fired from a short dis tance The question of a wound track travelling around the wall of the thorax or abdomen has scarcely to be considered The same conditions responsible for the directness and length of the tracks naturally explain the frequently multiple character of the visceral injuries sustained fcr example lung stomach liver neck thorax and abdomen and the common infliction of two or more separate tracks by one bullet for example arm and forearm with the elbow in a flexed position both lower extremities head and trunk or one upper extremity and trunk The direction of the traek is naturally dependent on the position of the body at the time of thie reception of the injury and the frequent assumption of the prone position in the pre sent campaign has led to the occurrence of a large proportion of longitudinal tracks in the trunk or trunk and head which will be referred to later Certain battles in fact have been characterised by the nature of the wouinds sustained thus at Belmont and Graspan wlhere rapid advances were made in the erect position fractured thighs were particularly numer ous while at Modder River where the men for a great part of the time lay on the battlefield in the prone position glanc ing wounds of the upliftedl head or longitudinal tracks of the trunk and limbs were especially frequent Secondly the tracks are of very small calibre and hence produce remarkable itndividual iijuries of narrow structures such as nerves and vessels to he lNter remarked upon while on the other hand the force o t he bullet seems to be mainly exerted on the tissues immediately before it so that only the area of tissue immediately surrounding the track is condensed as well as contused and vital structures lying but a very short distance away escaped any serious injury in a most surprising manner Thirdly the apertures of entry and exit are extremely small and in uncomplicated wound of the soft parts often differ little in appearance Tet apertures however prasent considerable variations in character according to the angle at which the bullet impinges upi Qi the surface or if the bullet has been deformed by strih in against some hard substance before entering the body or again the distal portion of the track and the wound of exit are materially modified when the bullet strikes a bone in its course When the bullet impinges on the surface at approximately a right angle the aperture of entry is circular and clean punched out about a third of an inch in diameter and the margin is slightly depressed and contused The exit opening is usually more slitlike and the surrounding contusion less marked the size in uncomplicated cases not exceeding that of the aperture of entry and there is rarely any appearance of starring When the bullet impinges obliquely the aperture of entry is oval that side of the entrance hole on which the bullet has rested sloping down in a shelving manner to the track when such openings are supported by a firm floor as the chest wall or a bone they are often of considerable size The most important modifications in the nature of the aper tures in cases uncomplicated by bone injury are due to altera tions in the shape of the bullet consequent on its striking against a stone or some hard substance prior to entering the body In some instances the bullet is simply bent or curved in others it is shortened the unbroken sheath forming folds on the shortened lead core in others the casing is torn or broken forming a ragged envelope projecting more or less widely Several variations of the last condition occur thus i the bullet may simply have the casing broken from the tip and be little altered it has been suggested that this may in some instances have been done by the soldier before firing with a view to the production of explosive effects 2 The broken casing may be rolled back so as to form an irregular fringe and this condition may reach such a degree that after entering the body the leaden core may entirely escape from the case and travel onwards leaving the jagged case entangled in the deep part of the track 3 The casing may be fissured longitudinally the broken portion projecting from the side of the bullet like a knife edge In either of the latter instances the apertures both of entry and exit lose all special characteristics they are large and irregular and the wound track is modified in a corresponding degree MEDICAL NEWS AND NEEDS IN NATAL FROM OUR SPECIAL WAR CORRESPONDENT Pietermaritzburg Natal January 12th FIjIE AT A HOSPITAL AT MARI ZBURG A SOMEWHAT serious fire occur ed on the eveniing of January 8th at the Lower Barrack Hospital at Maritzburg Two wards containing 50 beds were completely burntt out The building was of the usual type of wood and galvanised iron Fortu nately the patieits were got out smarr ly aril no harm what ever has resulted to a y of them The lual papers stated that the wards were unocupied at the time this is incorrect Some of the bedsteads w re lost Had there buen a strong wind blrwing the extiunsi jn of the fire would only with diffi culty have been preveited for although there is a fire station within two hundred yards the fire hose could not be got to work owing to lack of water until the huts were destroyed There were plenty of empty beds in other parts of the hospital and no serious inconvenience was oceasioned The result of inquiry as to the cause has not been made known but the fire as usual is ascribed to the upsetting of a lamp THE GARRISON CHURCH AS A HOSPITAL Steps are now being taken to convert the garrison church into a hospital The buildiig will accomnmodate 5o or 6o beds It is doubtful whether chirch buildings are ever in a warm climate well adapted for hospital purposes The ventilation is not good the windows beirng placed high and not opening freely enough and there is no tlhrough current of air Nor is the light all that could be desired Moreover it is a dis tinct disadvantage to mass so large a number of sick or wounded in one ward TentDs are only in use in the College Hospital at MaritzWurg So far the rainifall has beenunusually light for the rairny seasou 1lere but doubtless during the summer montlhs in Natal wheie trenensdous downpours of rain are as a rule friequenlt hospital patients would be better off in huts The progves of woundls here speaking generally is as satisfactory as could possibly be wished FEB 10 9901 SICKNESS AT THE MODDER RIVER TM BaZ 345 CONVALESCENT HOMES FOR OFFIcERS There would seem to be a good opening for more convalescent homes for wounded officers but apparently the necessary lnnds are not forthcoming Should any pressure occur the supply of beds for officers will hardly be adequate At pre sent the only convalescent hospital for officers is that under the management of Mrs Gunning and Mrs Graham which accommodates but 6 Another similar institution to take Io or 12 is talked of but not yet established and if started it will be by private enterprise The officers are exceedingly keen to get back to the front the moment they are pronounced well enough and itis to be feared that in some instances their chance may be lost owing to the necessity of providing a suffi ciency of hospital beds and the absence of suitable provision for cases not well enough to return to duty and yet too far advanced in convalescence to justify detention in hospital THE HOSPITAL SHIP NUBIA By GEORGE ASHTON MBVict Surgeon P and 0 F N Co CONVERSION FROM A TRANSPORT THE conversion of the ss Spartan from an ordinary passenger ship into a hospital ship with accommodation for 130 patients in Southampton last October elicited favourable comments from the home papers However in the fittingup of the transport Nubia for hospital purposes in Durban with accom modation for nearly 500 patients it may fairly be claimed that this young colony has shown its aged parent  how the thing ought to be done The ss Nubia belongs to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company She is 430 feet long 49 feet broad and her registered tonnage is 5914 She has a sea speed of 14 knots The Nubia was engaged last sum mer in the conveyance of the companys mails to China but in October she was chartered as a traDsport and brought the Scots Guards to the Cape She then proceeded to Durban where she will remain until the present campaign is over THE WORK OF EIGHT DAYS On December 25th 1899 a telegram was received by the naval authorities from the General Officer Commanding the Forces in Natal requesting them to select and fit up a large steamer as a hospital ship with all possible speed On the following day the Nubia was inepected aDd being deemed suitable 139 carpenters plumbrrs painters and electricians most of whom were refugees froml the Transvaal were at once placed on board By working day and night the ships whole aspect was changed and her interior completely rearranged and in eight days she was converted into a floating hospital replete in every detail and was ready for the reception of patients on January 4th The Nubia had been fitted for the carrying of 2000 troops and this entailed an additional amount of iabour as all the extensive troop fittings had to be removed ere the work could be begun It speaks well for the resources of Durban and for the energy of those to whom the work was entrusted that the change was completed in eight days as the magnitude of the task will be fully appreciated when it is known that every fitting every cot etc had to be procured or constructed locally THE WARDS Altogether there is accommodation for 474 sick wounded or convalescent patients These are distributed into seven wards iiartied A to G beginning in the fore part of the ship with Ward A and finishing in the stern with Ward G A Ward contains IOO convalescents B 26 cot cases C 32 cot eases D 200 convalescents E 28 cot cases F 30 cot cases G 30 cot cases whilst 28 cornvalescent officers have the use of the passengers cabins in which only the lower berths will be used the upper ones having been removed to make more room The convalescent men will sleep in hammocks The wards are all between decks and can be completely separated from one another by closing the watertight doors In Wards F and G which will be used for the most serious cases swing ing cots are provided so that when the ship proceeds to sea the motion will be reduced to a minimum thereby conducing to the comfort of these patients The ward floors have all been varnished and the sides matchboarded and painted white which adds an air of brightness and cleanliness to their appearance The vessel throughout is ventilated by steam ventilators and electric fans as a result the wards are always delightfully fresh and cool even in the middle of the day when the heat is sometimes oppressive THE OPERATING THEATRE AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES The operating theatre is situated on the main deck aft and is provided with all the latest appliances for the proper pursuit of antiseptic surgery Further aft still a mortuary is situated where postmortem examinations will be conducted and the plentiful supply of fresh water which is so necessary has been provided The dispensary is attached to Ward E and a washhouse and laundry are situated on the main deck amidships The approaches to the wards from the upper decks have been made easier and more adapted to the needs of invalids by having the steps broader and less perpendicular than is usual on board a ship Two lifts have also been fitted for the use of helpless patients They are worked by hand and are so contrived as to be free from jerking THE STAFF The medical staff consist of 6 doctors 7 nursing sisters and 35 attendants A guard of io marines and a corporal are at tached they are from HMS Terrible stationed here and their duties consist in keeping sentry at the gangway seeing that due order and discipline are maintained and that no convalescents leave the ship without permission During the conversion of the ship Sir William Mac Cormac paid a visit He expressed his satisfaction with the excellence of the work and gave several hints and suggestions CONFORTS FOR THE PATIENTS The ladies of Durban came forward with their usual muni ficence and supplied numbers of deck chairs small tables and screens as well as many hanging ferns and palms the8e enormously enhance the general comfort and cheerful aspect of the wards Every day baskets of flowers and fruit together with bundles of newspaper and illustrated periodicals arrive These contributions show that Tommy has won a large circle of sympathetic friends who are only too pleased to avail them selves of this opportunity to tender him a token of their appreciation CLIMATE The patients will be brought down from the base hospitals at Maritzburg and Frere and will travel in trains specially fitted up for the purpose These trains are made conspicuous by having the Red Cross painted on the carriages The soldiers will be kept on board until able to resume their duties at the front or if incapacitated from further service they will be sent home when they are fit to travel Cloudless blue skies from weeks end to weeks end with now and then an occasional shower of rain to relieve any possible monotony cool breezes from the southwest the fresh salt smell of the sea and an equable temperature day and night may be trusted soon to bring back health and strength to these in valids who having been shedding their blood in their countrys cause are now justly entitled to every care and comfort that a grateful country can provide Durban January i3th z910 SICKNESS AT THE MODDER RIVER FROM A CORRESPONDENT TYPHOID FEVER AND DIARRHG1A THERE has been no severe fighting since my last communica tion to you

AFRICA THE WOUNDED FROM THE ACTIONS BETWEEN MODDER AND DRIEFONTEIN By W Watson Cheyne FRS FRCS Consulting Surgeon with the Field Forces South Africa Bloemfontein April 1900 It may be of interest if I make a few remarks as to the wounds met with during the march from Modder to Bloem fontein I can only speak of them in their early stages  as yet I have no means of knowing what happened to them after the men were sent to the base Progress of the Wounds From what is said in my description of the march from Modder to Bloemfontein it will have been clear that anything like thorough asepsis on the field or even in the field hos pitals was a matter of the greatest difficulty  and yet it is a fact that the great majority of the wounds healed without any trouble This is no doubt due to the very small size of the wounds made by the Mauser bullet  to the fact that it splits the khaki and very seldom takes in pieces of clothing  to the small amount of oozing from the wounds  and lastly to the dryness of the air leading to rapid evaporation and formation of a scab over the surface under which healing rapidly occurs In fact the cases which have done best are those in which the patients have been wounded in the early part of the day and have lain out for some hours in the sun The asepsis of the interior of the wounds depends in these cases on the external crust  so long as that is undisturbed the wounds for the most part do well It is doubtful however whether this would be the case in a moister climate It was found moreover quite early in the campaign that it was a mistake to apply the piece of mackintosh which is in the field dressings because the wounds became septic and orders have been issued to discontinue its use On the other hand as would naturally be expected where the skin wounds are large whether caused by expanding bullets or by fragments of bone being driven outwards an aseptic result is by no means always obtained But from the report of the engagements on the western frontier it appears that a considerable proportion even of these wounds scabbed over and healed without any trouble The experience of such wounds on this march however has not been so good  at any rate almost all those which I have seen two or three days after infliction have been septic and more especially the com pound fractures Indeed all the compound fractures with large wounds have become septic the degree of virulence varying of course in different instances In several cases amputation was necessaryin one instance for acute spread ing gangrene One or two of the amputation cases have died while some will no doubt do well Wounds produced by Expanding Bullets The proportion of large flesh wounds was also I under stand greater in this march than in previous onesperhaps owing to the more frequent use of expanding bullets by the Boers There seems to be little doubt that expanding bullets of various types are now being largely used by them for apart from the increased proportion of large wounds numbers of these bullets have been found in the bandoliers and wallets and in the captured camps In the fight at Karee Siding on March 30th a good many men were wounded at long range and in several cases the bullets had not come out Three of these bullets which I saw extracted were of the expanding variety one was softnosed one a Jeffreys sporting bullet and one an ordinary Mauser with the end filed off Dry Dressings To get a dry crust on such wounds is not easy in any case and about Paardeberg especially there was so much extraneous fiepticity from dead horses etc and the water was so foul that the septicity of the wounds where trust was almost entirely placed in the drying of the discharge on the surface is not to be wondered at With the view of trying to get a better crust I provided two of the bearer companies with pepperboxes containing various antiseptic powders with which to dust the wounds before applying the field dressings The powders used were the double cyanide of zinc and mercury and chinosol mixedwith kaolin in various propor tions Owing to the distribution of the force I have not yet been able to ascertain whether they were used in the subse quent battles and if so with what result It seems how ever that better results might be obtained if at the dressing station or on the field the wounds were thickly dusted with such a powder before applying the first field dressings  and where the skin wound was large if the dressings were removed and the wound thoroughly purified in the usual manner followed by the application of a fresh cyanide dressing Remarkable Cases So many cases have been published already illustrating the remarkable course which modern bullets pursue without injuring structures which apparently could not escape that it would be tedious were I to add to their number I can only explain them by supposing that a wave precedes the point of the bullet in the soft fat which drives the harder structures to each side and thus permits the passage of the small bullet Injuries of the Skull The experience of bullet wounds through the skull seems to show that a good rule to follow is to trephine immediately over the aperture of entrance however trivial the injury ap parently is On opening up such a wound portions of the external table are found adhering to the periosteum or even driven along the track  the skull is perforated and the inner table is broken into fragments which are driven into the brain sometimes for a very considerable distance Where the entrance and exit wounds are near each other even where the bullet has traversed brain substance between the two open ings I have found in several cases that the skull in about an inch in breadth between the two openings has been broken into small fragments In many of the cases the symptoms at first are quite slight until later convulsive attacks supervene or until in the case of old septic wounds symptoms of intra cranial suppuration have appeared Of i2 cases which I saw at Paardeberg and Poplar Grove some time after the wound 3 were not trephined  1 of these died while 2 were sent back to the base two or three days after the injury and I do not know with what result Nine were tre phined from two to eight days after the injury either because they continued unconscious or more often because suppura tion was occurring One of these was sent to the base on the afternoon of the operation and the result is unknown Four died as was expected from the injuries to the brain being so extensive  3 improved very much 1 being sent to the Boer ambulance and the other 2 to the base The last one who was trephined ten days after the injury on account of sup puration improved very much during the two following days and was then sent away but after a few hours in a buck waggon became worse and died on the road Abdominal Cases The remarkable results which have followed penetrating ab dominal bullet wounds where no operative interference has been attempted have been repeatedly referred to in your pages When at Capetown I was shown a number of cases in which bullets had traversed the abdomen and healing had taken place without any trouble As far as I could gather only about 20 per cent of the abdominal cases had died In what proportion of the cases however perforation of the intestine had occurred it is extremely difficult to judge From the position of the wounds from the occurrence of blood in the faeces vomiting of blood formation of local peri toneal abscesses during healing etc there seems to be no reasonable doubt that in a considerable number of the cases the intestine must have been perforated  I cannot however but think that in many it has escaped When we remember the remarkable way in which other less slippery structures such as those about the root of the neck escape I do not see why the same should not occur in abdominal wounds However that may be the fact that a considerable number of perforating abdominal wounds recover without operation renders very difficult the question of the best treatment of such cases The difficulty is still further increased by the fact that under the conditions for operation in the field lapar I94 MSSwSSitTHE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICAMay 12 1900 otomy is by no means the safe operation that it is in a Lon don hospital Further some hours must in any case have elapsed and the patient been a good deal disturbed before reaching the field hospital It may be added that the cases in which from the symptoms there can be no doubt that the intestine has been injured the patients are usually in a very collapsed state by the time they reach the field hospital and not at all in a condition suitable for operation From these various considerations I determined that in the first instance and until I had learned from my own experience what the results in these cases were I would not operate unless in ex ceptional instances  hence up to the present time I have only opened the abdomen twice for perforating wounds I regret to say however that the results in the cases I have seen have not been nearly so good as I had been led to expect and I am inclined to think that were the conditions for opera tion more favourable one might with advantage interfere in a certain number of cases In transverse abdominal wounds it is doubtful whether any good result would follow operative interference because if the intestine is wounded at all it is probably perforated in many places But in anteroposterior wounds well to one side where there is probably only a single injury and more especially where it is probable that the ascending or descend ing colon is injured I think that one might in some cases intervene with advantage At any rate I intend to keep this point in mind in the future Perhaps I can best illustrate the results following these injuries by giving my experience of the fight at Karee Siding the other day where I was able to get notes of all the cases of abdominal injury On March 30th I received a telegram from Colonel Gormley RAMC PMO of the Seventh Division saying that a fight had occurred at Karee Siding about twentyone miles north of Bloemfontein on the previous afternoon  that there were a considerable number of serious cases and asking me to come out as soon as possible This I did partly by rail to Glen and thence by horse to Karee arriving there about 1 pm During the afternoon I went over the cases The number of the wounded was 154 and in 15 it was considered that the abdominal cavity had been penetrated Of these pa tients 5 had already died within twentyfour to twentyeight hours after the injury and I saw 10 who were still alive Of these 9 were left alone and 4 died within the next twenty four or thirtysix hours  five were still alive when I left Karee on Sunday afternoon April ist On one I operated but he died on April 2nd At Paardeberg and Driefontein I saw 12 cases  of these 11 were left alone with 7 deaths and 4 recovered to a sufficient extent to enable them to be sent to the base  the 1 operated on died The total result of the 25 cases not operated on is that 16 died and 9 were apparently recovering but whether they ultimately recovered or not I cannot say Of course it is only the cases which are recovering which reach the station ary or base hospitals and this may explain the discrepancy between my results and those formerly published No doubt many cases recover which one would not have thought could possibly get well but the above results show that abdominal bullet wounds are still very grave injuries and must be treated accordingly I may add that among my cases which are improving there are several in which the probabilities are that no abdominal viscus was injured I should say also that I have been shown some 5 or 6 other cases which may have recovered but as I did not see them again and as I could not ascertain the number of cases injured at the same time with their results they are valueless in enabling one to form conclusions and their inclusion would only be mislead ing The Karee statistics are really the only complete ones which I have as yet been able to obtain The following are the notes of the cases above alluded to Besides the 5 cases of abdominal wounds which had already died and of which I could get no complete details the follow ing 10 are cases which I saw from twentyfour to thirty hours after they were shot  Cases from the Action at Karee Case l The point of entrance was 2 inches to the right of the um bilicus and the bullet was found lying under the skin far back in the left loin The patient was pulseless and there was much rigidity of the abdomen tenderness and vomiting He died a few hours later Case nThe bullet coming from the side had entered the abdomen 4 inches below and behind the right nipple There was no exit wound The patient had been vomiting a good deal but not any blood  the abdo men was very rigid and tender He was obviously very ill and died the next morning The bullet had probably perforated the liver and stomach Case hiThere was a large wound above the right anterior iliac spine probably the point of exit and a small opening behind and near the spine on the same side There was great tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen He died a few hours later Case ivIn this case there was a transverse wound of the abdomen the bullet having entered on the right side in the middle of the lumbar region and passed out on the left side rather higher up and further back All the symptoms of acute peritonitis were present The patient died the next morning Case vThe bullet had entered the anterior end of the sixth inter costal space on the left side and was found lying under the skin over the seventh intercostal space on the right side and about 2 inches further back He had vomited blood on the previous day The bullet may have perforated the stomach The epigastrium was somewhat tender but there were no marked symptoms On April ist he was going on well Case viThe place of entrance of the bullet was 1 inch in front of the right anterior superior spine and of exit behind the left sacroiliac synchondrosis There was much haemorrhage at the time His condi tion when I saw him was fair and there was no marked abdominal tender ness On April ist his morning temperature was 1010 There were no signs of general peritonitis and his condition was good Case vii The bullet had entered from behind about the tip of the twelfth rib on the left side and had left about the middle of the epi gastrium and rather to the left of the middle line Vomiting was still going on but not of blood There was much tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen and he was almost pulseless On April first his general condi tion was better but the abdomon was very rigid and tender Case viiiThe point of entrance of the bullet was about 2 inches from the anterior end of the seventh left intercostal space and of exit rather lower down aDd further back on the right side The patient said that he had vomited brown fluid after the injury There was much abdominal pain but his general condition was fair On April ist there was still much pain but his general condition was good Case ixThe bullet had entered about i inch in front of the anterior inferior spine on the right side had gone directly backwards and had come out in the buttock The patient however suffered very little On March 31st there was slight tympanites and tenderness in the right iliac fossa The bowels acted well aud no blood was passed On April ist he was very well and it was considered very doubtful if any viscus was wounded Case xThe point of entrance was in the middle of the right buttock a little above the level of the trochanter  the exit was through the an terior abdominal wall in the right semilunar line at the level of the um bilicus The patient was decidedly ill  the abdomen was a good deal distended and pressure on it caused an escape of gas through the anterior opening There was a good deal of abdominal tenderness and rigidity I opened the abdomen outside the right linea semilunaris and found a perforation in the anterior wall of the ascending colon without any adhesions around which was easily stitched up The posterior opening was found about 2 inches lower down with a piece of omentum firmly adherent to it and completely closing it As the patient was in a bad state I thought it better instead of excising the piece of intestine beyond the holes or tearing off the omentum to leave the wounds alone merely cleaning out the peritoneal cavity as well as I could and arranging for free drainage He rallied from the operation very well and for twentyfour hours it looked as if he might get better  but he gradually got worse and died on April 2nd Cases from the Actions at Paardeberg and Driefontein Case xlIhis man was shot on February 18th and was seen by me on February 23rd The bullet entered in the middle line in front about 2 inches above the pubes and passed out through the middle of the left buttock about 2 inches above the trochanter The patient was in a very bad way very restless and losing flesh  his temperature was 1010 and there was much tenderness about the pelvis and buttock Urine was running from the posterior wound but the bladder held about 8 ounces The wound in the buttock was enlarged and drained but he gradually became worse and died on February 27th Case xiiThis was a Boer who was shot on February 24th transversely through the abdomen just above the anterior superior spine He was extremely collapsed  blood and faeces were coming out of the aperture on the left side He was too far gone for any operation but the opening was enlarged so as to allow free escape of fseces He died the same evening Case xiiiThis patient was wounded on FebruaryiSth The bullet entered behind in the right lumbar region and came out in front close to the right side of ihe umbilicus For two days he had severe peritoneal sym ptoms vomiting etc These gradually improved and on February 24th he was much better and it seemed as if he would recover While using the bedpan on that day however he strained a good deal and suddenly became collapsed He complained of violent pain in the abdomen ana died in twenty minutes Case xivThis patient was wounded on February 23rd and was seen February 24th The bullet entered in the right lumbar region just below the last rib and came out near the middle line on the left side about the level of the anterior superior spine He was very collapsed when admitted On the 24th there was abdominal pain and tenderness rigid ity and vomiting His pulse was 136 and his temperature 10060 His condition remained very much the same for two days and then on February 26th faeces began to come through the posterior wound After that he gradually became worse and died on March ist Case xvThis man was wounded on February 18th and seen on February 24th The bullet entered at the upper part of the right buttock about the middle and came out about 2 inches to the left of the middle line 1 inch below the level of the umbilicus There was much vomiting at first When seen there was still much tenderness of the abdomen especially about the umbilicus and the abdomen was rigid but he was said to be better than he had been He was passing natural motions He however gradually went down hill and died February 22nd May 12 1900IIMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITALmJjSL 95 r Case xviThe patient was wounded on March 8th and seen on March 9th The bullet entered a little to the left of the umbilicus and weot almost directly backwards and slightly downwards and came out in the upper part of the buttock When seen on the 9th there was general peri tonitis and faeces were coming out of the posterior wound He was taken to Drief ontein in an ambulance waggon on the next day  he became much worse during the journey and died on his arrival there Case xvii was wounded on March xoih The bullet entered the ninth interspace on the right side about 3 inches in front of the midaxillary line and came out close to the spine behind at a little lower level The patient was very well when first seen and continued so for some hours later except that he complained of numbness in his right leg However after moving from the field hospital at Driefontein to a farmhouse he became very ill with uncontrollable vomiting and abdominal pain and died about thirty hours after the wound Case xviiiThis man was wounded on February22nd and seen on Feb ruary 23rd The bullet had entered behind at the middle of the lower part of the sacrum and come out in the middle line in front just above the pubes The urine was clear when drawn off some hours afterwards He had a good deal of pain about the abdomen and pelvis with vomiting and rigidity On the day after I saw him the sickness was less and the temperature was just under ioo There had been a good deal of diar rhoea with some blood in the motions On the 26th urine began to come through the anterior wound and a catheter was tied in  otherwise the patients condition had improved He was sent to the base on March ist steadily improving Case xix was similar to Case xi Urine was coming through the pos terior wound when I saw him and there was a good deal of swelling in the buttock A catheter was tied into the bladder and the sinus in the buttock well opened up and drained He was sent to the base on Feb ruary 26th Case xxThis man was wounded on February 18th and seen on Feb ruary 24th The bullet had entered in the interval between the eighth and ninth ribs in front on the left side There was no exit wound On the 24th there was marked rigidity of the abdomen with pain and tender ness and still occasional vomiting The bowels had not yet acted An enema was given with good results On the 27th the patient was rather better but there was still a good deal of rigidity He was sent to the toase on February 28th Case xxiThe patient was wounded on February 18th and seen on February 24th The bullet had entered the tenth interspace on the right side rather in front of the midaxillary line and had come out through the ninth left interspace about the same level There was a good deal of pain about the upper part of the abdomen lasting for about three days and also vomiting but no blood in the vomit After that the patient gradually improved On the 24th the abdomen was quite soft and flat and he was doing well He was sent to the base on March 26th It is probable that the liver alone was wounded Case xxii was wounded on March 9th and was seen about eight hours afterwards The bullet had entered about three inches to the right of the umbilicus gone backwards and somewhat inwards and had emerged at the edge of the lumbar muscles The aperture of the exit was large readily admitted a finger and faeces and offensive bloody discharge were coming from it The patient was much collapsed I opened the abdomen over tne ascending colon and at once came on the bullet wound close to the mesenteric attachment On turning over bowel it was found that the posterior opening was to the inside of the reflection of the peritoneum and did not communicate with that cavity The operation was done in the middle of the night with almost no light and as the patient was almost pulseless I contented myseJf with closing the anterior opening cleansing out the peritoneum in the vicinity and putting a large tube through the posterior opening into the bowel so as to establish a faecal fistula The patient died of acute sepsis two days later Case xxiiiI may add one verv interesting case which I saw two days ago A man was wounded in the fight at the waterworks on April ist three days before I saw him A spent bullet struck the abdomen just to the right of the umbilicus but did not penetrate the skin He became much collapsed and when I saw him he was in the last stage of suppurative peritonitis He died a few hours later On postmortem examination rents were found in two adjacent coils of the small intestine In one it was about an inch in length clean cut and went transversely through all the coats In the other it was as if a knife had been drawn obliquely across a wrinkled intestine so that at three places in its course it divided the serous coat alone while at one end all the coats were penetrated Where the bullet struck the skin there was a small slough still firmly adherent and underneath it a cavity containing pus gas and sloughing tissue which communicated with the peritoneal cavity by a minute opening THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY HOSPITAL As our readers have already learnt from the letter from Mr Alfred Fripp MS FRCS Chief Surgeon published in the British Medical Journal of March 31st 1900 p 777 the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital was ordered to be established at Deelfonteinonthe railway 27 miles south of De Aar and 474 from Capetown Some of the initial difficulties encountered in getting the hospital into working order while a single line of railway already crowded was the only means of getting up not merely supplies but the hospital tents and huts them selves are described in the following letter delayed in trans mission which we have received from Mr F Newland Pedley FRCS Dental Surgeon to the hospital  Early Difficulties  We were originally intended to be a base hospital near Capetown but when we arrived the whole aspect of the war had changed  General Roberts had commenced his victorious invasion of the Free State and we were wanted near De Aar Junction So in two days we had left Capetown and after about forty hours spent on a train we were safely landed at Deelfontein which consisted of a small railway station and one diminutive general store It is situated on a sandy plateau 4000 feet above sea level On the south side of the railway the ground is flat for miles whilst on the north side there is a row of kopjes not more than 600 feet high The site of the hospital is at the base of the kopje The neighbourhood boasts a few scattered Dutch farms I  In imagination we found at Deelfontein a hospital com Elete in every detail and ready for the reception of patients  ut as a fact there were only a few tents a halfbuilt store house a pile of crates and our personal luggage  everything I else was in Capetown We soon saw that it would require weeks of incessant labour before we could get the hospital into firstrate working order In vain did we bombard Capetown with telegrams asking for our stores and material to be sent on immediately We were compelled to recognise the fact that the railway is only a single line and that an immense army in the Free State has to be supplied with food stores and ammunition We see a daily procession of trains going to the front crowded with men and horses and at short in tervals long luggage trains go panting along under the heaviest load they can carry Goods and material arrived daily but not always in the right order Of all things we were anxious to erect hospital wards for the reception of patients whom the authorities were pressing us to receive but whilst we had a quantity of sides and roofs for the wards the parts that repre sented the foundation were missing for two or three days and work was stopped  One week after our arrival orders came that we were to re ceive 200 patients who would arrive in two days from the receipt of the wire This demanded redoubled exertion on our part and Colonel Sloggett decided to remove all his men and the whole of the medical staff to the opposite side of the railway in order to utilise some of the existing accommoda tion for the reception of patients The mdical staff and the dressers had to work all day long assisting to remove their tents and belongings from the old camp to the opposite side of the line The tents had to be carried and although a fatigue party from an adjoining military picket was kindly sent to assist us we all had a very hot thirsty sandy days work and the medical staff could easily have been mistaken for a gang of amateur navvies  But if life was not quite happy for us what shall we say about Colonel Sloggett the Commandant  Every detail con nected with the installation of the hospital and the feeding commissariat has to be organised and personally superin tendent by him and the task of getting us ready in time re quires a man with the strength of an ox the patience of Job and a flow of persuasive language Fortunately for us Colonel  Sloggett possesses all these qualities His wonderful organ ising power his untiring energy and his marvellous tact in dealing with his men black and white strike everyone twith admiration The Site of the Hospital  The Bite chosen for the hospital is particularly salubrious The sun during the day is excessively hot but there is gener ally a cool breeze and the evenings are delightful The sand which rises in clouds whenever the wind blows has given many of us a kind of sore throat which we call  sand throat We have scarcely half a dozen trees in sight The surface of the ground is covered in patches with a low growth of prickly scrub called karroo bush which is not free from snakes I have seen several and we never miss a chance of killing them for the blacks say they are poisonous When all the difficulties of transport had been overcome the wards consisting of huts and tents were arranged in I three divisions two surgical in charge of Mr Fripp and Mr I Raymond Johnson respectively and one medical under the J charge of Dr Washbourn Three medical officers were asso I ciated with each surgeon and five with the physician and five I dressers were attached to each surgical division The full I complement of beds in each division was three times 58 beds 174 To each 58 beds two day sisters and one night

may result to the patient must be very  great In more than one case the result of the movement was to precipitate a fatal issue Under the existing circum stances however no other course seemed possible Military considerations prevented our carrying the wounded on with us which indeed would have been almost as bad and were equally against leaving them behind when we moved on The ideal plan would have been to have sent back all those whom it was safe to move and leave the serious cases behind at a field hospital at each stopping place with the necessary medical and other attendants It was not however  considered safe to do so at Paardeberg  there would have been difficulty in providing food and attendance there was no house and tents could not be spared At Driefontein on the other hand though the communications with Kimberley had been closed and there were no empty waggons available to take on the wounded there was a house and tents could also be spared as no further fighting was expected until the army reached the neighbourhood of Bloemfontein This im possibility of transporting the patients was a very fortunate thing for them They were left behind with great advantage to their prospects of recovery Foon Water and Sickness The amount of sickness in the force during the long and trying march was remarkably small and probably in no other climate would so little harm have resulted During the day the heat of the sun was scorching and at first quite a number of men suffered more or less severely from heat stroke and exhaustion On the other hand in the early morning before dawn the cold was often great while on several nights rain fell and of course as no tents were carried everybody got soaked and did not get dry till the sun came up For the first few days the thirst was terrible and many who had campaigned in India said that the thirst here was much worse All good resolutions about boiling or filtering water were thrown to the winds  water no matter how muddy had to be got as quickly as possible For some time we were on half rations and the fresh meat was often so tough as to be quite uneatable On several occasions where the marches were lcng the convoys did not arrive till late or not at all so that even the half rations were not obtainable The man therefore who had not taken the precaution of carrying something in his saddle bags had to go supperless to bed To bed is rather a euphemistic expression for when the baggage did not come in bedsimply meant lying down on the veld without covering of any kind And yet in spite of all this after a few weakly members had been weeded out in the early period the health of the troops was excellent The main trouble and one from which almost all the force has suffered at one time or another has been diar rhoea or as it has come to be more elegantly called Modders or Riets according to the river water which was being drunk and according to the severity of the case the former being considered more severe than the latter In some cases it has been so severe as to necessitate the admission of the patients to the field hospitals or even their return to the base In the great majority of cases however the trouble has been slight and easily controlled and was probably due either to salines dissolved in the water or to the irritating effect of the mud Since our arrival in Bloem fontein enteric fever is making its appearance among the troops The disease was probably contracted at Paardeberg  indeed considering the state of the Modder River at that camp produced by the waste from Cronjes laager above ano the impossibility of preventing the troops using that water it is surprising that the result was not much more serious From Modder River to Jacobsdal It may perhaps be of most interest to your readers if I give a short account of the march from February 12th when Lord Roberts left Modder River to March 13th when he entered Bloemfontein referring more especially to the points bearing on the treatmeat of the wounded On Friday February 9th while at Orange River I received a telegram from Colonel Stevenson RAMC Principal Medical Officer with Lord Robertss force asking me to join the headquarters staff which I accordingly did at Modder River on Sunday February nth Next morning February THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA THE MARCH FROM MODDER RIVER TO BLOEMFONTEIN By W Watson Cheyne FRS FRCS Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force South Africa Bloemfontein April 1900 A short account of Lord Robertss great march from Modder River to Bloemfontein may be of interest to readers of the British Medical Journal more especially as it illustrates the difficulties attending the treatment of the wounded under conditions different from those encountered during the earlier operations of this war Before this march began the various actions had taken place in close proximity to a railway line on which admirablyfitted hospital trains were at hand to carry off the wounded with com paratively little disturbance and lodge them in wellappointed stationary hospitals within a short time Indeed in such places as Modder River the field hospitals were able to accommodate the more seriously wounded till such time as it was safe to move themin fact they more resembled stationary hospitals Further there was ample transport from the field of battle and only a short distance for the wounded to travel  hence they were rapidly collected and quickly lodged in tents where they could remain till it was safe to send them to the base Difficulties of Transport The conditions on this march were very different In the first place as a matter of military necessity it was con sidered essential to cut down the number of ambulances with each division from the normal number of ten to two The possibility that very serious difficulty and delay in collecting the wounded from the battlefields might result from this decision was repeatedly and emphati cally pointed out to the military authorities by the medi cal department but without avail The justice of this warning was fully borne out at the battle of Driefontein Not only was the number of the ambulances cut down but all the other equipment tents etc had also to be reduced and as a result many of the wounded more especially at Paarde berg had to bivouac under the shade of the trees where available or failing themand there are no trees in this country except along the river beds and around farmhouses under temporary shelters made with blankets This diminution of baggage affected all the arrangements  for example it was often impossible to get boiled water mainly because owing to the small number of kettles carried all were required for cooking In part however this was due also to the difficulty of getting fuel and to the small amount of water obtainable Such water as could be got was not only small in quantity but often extremely muddy so that the ordinary charcoal filter did not clear it properly and very soon became so choked up that the water ran through very slowly  for the latter reason the Berkefeld and similar filters were of very little use In some of the field hospitals operations had to be doean the open as the operating tent was required for the serious cases and if a dust storm came on in the middle of the operation the conditions as regards asepsis were by no means Ideal At Paardeberg antiseptic dressings ran out at one of the hospitals but I was able to tide over this difficulty because owing to the generosity of Lord Lister I had with me some double cyanide powder with which we were able toimpregnate sufficient material In this march as has been said we were away from a railway the distance from the base increasing day by day Yet the eick and wounded had to be sent back  they could not be left on the veld It is a very different thing to transport wounded a short distance to a comfortable ambulance train well supplied with every convenience from putting them into buck or ox waggons and sending them for two three or in the case of Poplar Grove four days journey over the veld with no roads in springless carts without suitable protection from the sun or rain and without the comfort which a recentlywounded man requires The agony which must be endured under such circumstances by many cases such as compound fractures 5 1094 mSSSJFROM MODDER RIVER TO BLOEMFONTEINMay 5 1900 12th early we left Modder River by train for Enslin and sub eequently rode to Ramdam in Free State territory a distance of about 12 miles Thence we went next day February 13th to De Kiels Drift on the following day to Watervai Drift on Thursday February 15th to Wegdraai and on Friday to Jacobsdal This completed the first part of the expeditiont and during this time General Frenchs division had preceded us and entered Kimberley and General Kelly Kennys division had followed more slowly in his tracks This was in most respects the most trying part of the march The heat during the day was very great and on rthe first and second days especially led to a considerable number of men falling out from fatigue and heat stroke and some 60 had to be sent back Beyond some scrub there was no vegetation and the passage of large numbers of troops and the enormous lines of transport stirred up the dust so that dust storms were frequent Further the convoy arrived very late on the first day especially and those unaccustomed to this sort of cam paigning and unprovided with food in their saddlebags had to go without From a surgical point of view there was little of importance during this part of the march On arriving at De Kiels Drift on the Tuesday February 13th we found that General French had had a slight engagement on the previous evening and that four wounded had been left behind With the exception of a little bugler boy who was wounded in the foota per forating wound through the front part of the footwhile running up the river bank as he said to get a shot at the Boers the cases were not serious The next wounded with whom we had to deal were at Wegdraai on Thursday Feb ruary 15th A small fight took place between there and Jacobsdal in which a few were wounded while some others were brought in from Watervai Drift We had left that drift about 5 am on Thursday morning and after the army had gone on a considerable force of Boers attacked the rear part of the convoy which had not yet moved on and captured a considerable number of waggons About 16 wounded were brought in and treated early on Friday morning February 16th With one or two exceptions how ever the wounds were comparatively slight and the wounded were taken on to Jacobsdal in the afternoon and sent to Modder River The German Ambulance At Jacobsdal we visited the German ambulance meeting Drs Kettner and Hildebrand assistants of Professors Bruns and Esmarch They very kindly showed us all their arrange ments and cases many of the latter being of considerable interest Their hospital was established chiefly in the school buildings and was very completely fitted out A large pro portion of the wounds were from shrapnel and as opposed to the experience on the English side they told us that they had only met with a small proportion of bullet wounds Con sequently the skin wounds were frequently large and in a considerable proportion suppuration was going onindeed had already begun when they were admitted The experi ence of the surgeons to this ambulance in abdominal wounds was not very good but on the whole they were inclined to leave them alone in the first instance at any rate They had not had a large number of wounded After the battle of Magersfontein they had about 100 Paardeberg We left Jacobsdal onfthe morning of Monday February 19th at 4 am and rode through to Paardeberg a distance of about twentyseven miles with a halt of two hours at Klip Kraal drift On arriving there about 1 pm we found an action going on chiefly artillery and heard that a big fight had taken place on the previous day in which over 800 had been wounded In the evening we took up our quarters on the banks of the Modder River about three miles below Cronjes laager and in the immediate neighbourhood of the two field hospitals of the Sixth Division under Majors Pike and Ford respectively one of the fierd hospitals of the Ninth Division under Major Murray and the Australian field hospital under Major Fiaschi  the other field hospital of the Ninth Division under Major Sawyer was at a drift about a mile further down the river During the previous days fight the field hospitals had been shelled by the Boers without however anyone being hurt but they had had to shift their quarters As the result of the battle the Boers had retired higher up the river the banks of which at this part were pretty high but sloping and lined with small trees acacias etc The hospital tents were pitched just above the banks of the river where there were fortunately also some larger trees which gave shade to those patients who could not be accommodated in tents We bivou acked halfway down the bank and might have been picnick ing on the banks of the Thames but for the occasional booming of big guns and the rattle of rifles Below Cronjes Laager The water of the Modder was as its name Mud River im plies thick with mud and foul smelling from the dead ani mals and refuse from Cronjes laager Water bottles containing it when opened frequently went off with a pop and the gas which escaped was of a distinctly disagreeable odour Hence as far as possible drinking water was brought in the water carts from a farm about five miles away There was not enough of this drinking water however bo spare for surgical purposes so that the only supply available was from the river while owing to the small number of kettles it was impossible to get a sufficient quantity boiled The plain around the camp very soon became a sandy desert so that the air was always full of dust and dust storms were frequent For some days the number of the wounded was so great that the operating tent in one of the field hospitals had to be utilised for the patients and operations had to be undertaken in the open Although the greater number of the patients were those wounded in the fight of February 18th still a few came in every day either as the result of small fights with those trying to relieve Cronje or as the result of sniping During our stay at Paardeberg the weather was fairly good but on two nights there was much rain On Saturday Feb ruary 24th and during the night it rained heavily and the river rose considerably with the result that during the whole of Sunday there was a constant procession down the stream of dead and putrid horses and other animals from the Boer camp Several hundreds were counted and as a rule as many as fifteen or twenty were to be seen at one time The stench from these animals was very bad espe cially if they happened to be temporarily arrested by branches of trees and so on Hence the greatest care had to be exercised in the sanitation of the camp and it says a great deal for the arrangements adopted that no illness except the everpresent  Modders developed It was however impossible to prevent the men drinking the river water  and that is I believe the source of the considerable number of cases of enteric fever which have developed since our arrival at Bloemfontein Indeed the state of the river was so bad that the removal of the camp had become a neces sity when the brilliant attack of the Canadians during the early morning of February 27th fortunately brought Cronjes dogged resistance to an end Arove Cronjes Laager Above the laager the conditions were verydifferent There the water was good though muddy the veld had not yet become trodden down and the troops stationed there were in good condition Since our arrival here the number of cases of enteric fever developing among these troops has been quite small In company with Major Bond RAMC I rode over on February 23rd to the part of the field hospital of the Seventh Division under Major Franklin which was located on the banks of the river about two miles above the laager and saw several interesting cases The camp was very pleasantly situated on the banks of the river and the wounded were doing well and were as indeed was the case in all the field hospitals excellently looked after In Cronjes Laager On the morning of Tuesday February 27th after Cronje had come in Colonel Stevenson Major Sylvester RAMC his secretary and I rode out to the Boer laager to see what assistance was necessary for the Boer wounded The laager presented an appalling picture of devastation and the stench was frightful Dead animals in all stages of decomposi tion were lying about everywhere  a house close to the drift in which a large number of horses had been stabled had had its gable blown in and was full of dead horses The greater May  1900I FROM MODDER RIVER TO BLOEMFONTEIN mwEEu io95 number of the waggons were in ruins some overturned some more or less completely burnt while others were represented by a mass of broken wood and iron The ground around was pitted and yellow from the lyddite shells and strewn with fragments of shell shrapnel broken carts and all sorts of i dbris The laager was in most parts surrounded by trenches or rather rifle pits each holding one or two men and completely shel tering them The banks of the river were full of deep burrows in which the men had lain and in which the wounded were found So well concealed were these bur rows that it was only after repeated search that one could be sure that all the wounded had been found  their condition was lamentable in the extreme Their doctors and am bulances had left them and gone in to Jacobsdal when the flight from Grey College Bloemfontein Magersfontein took place The wounded had been lying in the foul laager without medical attendance or dressings of any kind and as a consequence the wounds were very foul and many of the patients were in a deplorable condition from sepsis The septic state of the wounds is very well illustrated by the fact that next day while we were again out at the place where the Boer wounded had been collected secondary haemor rhage occurred in two cases and would bave proved fatal had we not happened to be on the spot Cronjes resist ance for so long a

the wishes of the great majority of his fol lowers cannot be too strongly con demned Suspect ing the state of Dames Institute Bloemfontein matters Lord Roberls several days before the surrender offered to take over the wounded and have them carefully attended to and when Cronje refused that he offered to send in medical men to dress the wounds and attend to the patients This offer was also refused by Cronje un less the medical men stayed with him altogether a condi tion to which Lord Roberts naturally could not accede Lord Robertss humanity was also strikingly illustrated by the way in which he limited his offensive operations to what was necessary to keep up pressure and convince Cronje of the hopelessness of his case without des troying more lives than could possi bly be avoided Having collected the wounded of which we counted 159 a few more were subsequently discovered and dressings having been applied by several members of the Royal Army Medical Corps who had come out they were carried across the drift on stretchers for the water was too deep for ambulance wag gons to cross and were deposited on the river bank in a nice shady spot about a quarter of a mile higher up the river Two of the Boer doctors having in the meantime arrived from Jacobsdal they were provided with dressings food and such covering as could be spared and the wounded were handed over to their charge I fear that there was not very much done for them however in the surgical way for several casessuch as eancrenereauirinc

SurgeoninChief Irish Hospital South African Field Force From Bloemfontein to Kroonstadt Bloemfontein was a vast improvement upon Naauwpoort but I was glad to leave it if only for a change The position of the Irish Hospital camped on the gentle slope of the principal kopje of the town was all that was desirable It commanded a view of a great plain and of hills whose names are wellknown at homeLeenberg Bushmans Kop Springfield and the great towering Thaba Nchu round which fights soon began to wage and we could hear the booming of guns and occasionally see the column of smoke of a burning farm But for all that we were afflicted by a special curse in the shape of flies The wintry chill of the evenings drove them into the tents where they ranged themselves in armies and battalions to the number of hundreds of thousands At lunch time when the eun had given them a new fillip they descended upon us from the tent ceiling and assailed everything that was eatable They challenged the right of anyone to food and impudently wrestled with the morsel on its way to your mouth  rushed headlong into soup or milk or tea and generally did their best to make the life of the invading stranger as miserable as possible So when the order came on Wednesday May 9th to move the ambulance portion of the hospital to the front I had at least one joy to oppose to some regrets The equipment of our hospital included 15 ambulance waggons and 10 large tortoise tents with about 25 small square bell tents I determined to take 10 ambulances 6 small tents and 4 large These last were arranged so that the top bar of the waggon served as the central support the ides being rolled up and a little drill enabled us to pitch a tent to contain 14 patients in about eight minutes I took with me Dr Coleman Dr Pounden Mr Percy Stewart and Mr Douglas Thomson with orderlies and drivers leaving behind 60 occupied beds in charge of Dr George Stoker Dr Friel Mr Macllwaine and Mr Edwardes We left Bloemfontein on Thursday afternoon May 10th with 14 waggons and carts and made our first halt about six miles out Thence we passed through Glen Karee Siding Brand fort Vet River Smaldeel Welgelegen Zand River Geneva Siding on to Kroonstadt For a day we were advised to march with a large column as the enemy was reported to be ahead of us in force  but he did not appear and as our pro gress was slow we slipped away in the early morning and made our own way thereafter reaching the headquarters at Kroonstadt at 1 oclock on Thursday May 17th The country through which we passed and over which the advancing army had already preceded us was very different irom Cape Colony or the Great Karoo For a day or two the kopjes had been diminishing in numbers Now and again we could trace the banks of some intermittent stream by the presence of thorn bushes The plain was no longer sparsely grassed but there was gradually increasing fodder as we got north At last at Theron we left the last kopje behind us and although we saw it for a long time we saw no semblance of another in the three days that elapsed before our arrival at Kroonstadt The plains seemed endless Far as one could see there was nothing but grass Day after day we went along meeting not more than two or three people and seeing no signs of habitation but an occasional house or Kaffirs kraal sometimes miles away from our track The farms uniformly displayed a white flag Some of them I visited but the only occupants were women and children or very old men The young men were in some commando but their mothers and sisters at home only wished that the war was at an end They asked anxiously if more troops were coming for they had seen column after column pass in long streams and the only answer was that they were coming like waves of the sea To those who see the veld in this region and trek across it for the first time there must be I think a powerful fascina tion I had never seen plains so vast so silent and so void of human life What we looked upon were called farms but they were really great cattle ranches No hedgerow or wall broke the landscape The immense plain often fiat as a cricket field for miles sometimes rolling away in farstretch ing undulations was only marked at great distances by the wellknown barbed wire fences which marked out the limits of the property As to tillage there was practically none except a few patches of Kaffir corn or mealies  perhaps they were almost swallowed in the surrounding vastness of grass land and were really more extensive than I thought Life from this week was a delight Up at 4 oclock we breakfasted in the moonlight at 5 and were well on our way at 6 just as the day began to break The mornings were very sharpI have seen ice an inch thick herebut by 9 oclock the greatcoat was abandoned and for the rest of the day we had a really hot sun Walking riding driving followed in turn and then dinner at 6 in the moonlight again The sense of freedom in this great solitude  the exhilarating air  the brisk bracing cool of the evening were unspeakably attrac tive  and the unbroken sleep that followed such a day even on the floor of a waggon made me often declare that this was the real cure for insomnia On arriving at Kroonstadt I was informed by Colonel Stevenson thePMO in the field that we were to be attached to the Guards Brigade in the Eleventh Division under General PoleCarew  but subsequently this was changed and we were ordered to act as field hospital to the Royal Artillery the Naval Brigade the Royal Engineers and generally to the divisional troops From Kroonstadt to Johannesburg The now famous march of Lord Robertss army from Kroonstadt to Johannesburg ending in the surrender of the latter town began on Tuesday May 22nd and ended on the following Tuesday when we reached Elandsfontein a suburb and seized the railway junction It was a novel thing to have a civil hospital and ambulances in the field and every man of us was proud to take a part in this great historical event No other civilian hospital was thus honoured but they were all doing their share of work at Bloemfontein and other places in the rear Each day we expected to fight On Wednesday the news was that 6000 Boers were entrenched across our path but General French and Colonel Hutton who were operating with cavalry and mounted infantry a long way in front turned their flank and they fled This was the daily course of events We could hear the big guns thundering ahead of us for an hour or two then followed silence and we knew that the enemy had again retired The interest of the day for us was in part centred in crossing fearful drifts or discussing the pro babilities of what would happen at Johannesburg We were without news of the outside world We had no letters or newspapers  we did not know what was happening on our right or left save through vague rumours which always took the most exaggerated shape  and we rather envied the people at home who knew all about the stirring events that were happening The destruction of the railway line was remarkable Splendid bridges at Kroonstadt and other places had been utterly ruined There appeared to be a special malice in reducing high piers and buttresses to stoneheaps Every culvert was gone and as we approached the Vaal the line itself had been more frequently attacked The plan was to place dynamite under the joinings of the rails and blow them up Freed from its holdings the steel sprang up in great curves and as you looked along for miles you saw these weird arms extended into the air It seemed impossible that the repairs could be quickly effected but the Royal Engineers and the Railway Pioneers struggled with the wreck night and day and the railhead was only two days behind us at some points The supply of a great army in the field with food is a diffi culty which perhaps does not present itself to the average mind In Europe there are plenty of railways  here there is one and that a single line The food for this armya thousand miles up into Africahad to be carried by ox waggons Each of these uses about sixteen or twenty animals and this may give an idea of what a huge cavalcade followed the troops The supply of food has been a triumph of manage ment and Colonel Ward CB and his star have done marvels A German officer who knows the country told me that even to Africanders it was astonishing and that no other 182 MBSSjTHE ENGAGEMENT AT PRETORIA July 21 1900 nation could have done what he had seen accomplished during this campaign We arrived at the Vaal River on Sunday May 27th and looked for the first time upon the Transvaal We expected a stand here  but as usual the Boers were driven out on the day before and we were free to cross We rode through the river and then we realised that we had already con quered one country and were entering upon the conquest of another On Monday May 28th we marched twentytwo miles to Klip River and encamped and next morning started at 6 for Johannesburg It was a day to be remembered We had not gone a mile before we learned that one of the big 7ton 47 naval guns had gone through the bridge I went on to see what had happened I found a deep sluggish stream about 20 feet wide and over this a structure of tree trunks the only road bridge I had seen since I left Capetown The huge gun was lying on its side one wheel touching the water the other in the air Fortunately the lignt guns and the infantry had got over but for everything else in the shape of wheeled vehicles passage was impossible The engineers put up a trestle bridge but it broke down under a big telegraph waggon and then another had to be got up In four hours by the aid of men and eighty oxen the gun was extricated Then a drift had to be made and finally after a delay of eight hours we were able to cross We had still to march seventeen miles and there remained only a couple of hours of daylight but we hurried on As the sun went down I saw on the left a ridge of lowlying hills and there in the twilight halfadozen tall chimneysone smokingthat told me I was looking upon Johannesburg After tnis the journey was intricate and very tiring The column made its way over stony hills full of ruts littered with small boulders The night was very dark and there was a piercing wind Kaffirs shouted at their teams mules gave out oxen bellowed and the waggons rumbled along colliding with stones rolling into waterways until one wondered how long the fore carriages would stand For hours we went on looking eagerly for a camp fire and then at 9 we reached our destination We were at Elandsfontein and were overlooking Johannesburg We had done a record march with really very little loss For six days our ambulance waggons had carried on the sick and wounded because they could not be sent back by convoy and although many were very ill we had lost none Next day we moved to a pleasant field sheltered by trees and pitched all our big tents to accommodate 50 patients beside the Guards Hospital Here more sick and several wounded were received On Thursday morning May 31st at 1030 in the middle of dressing woik I had orders from Colonel Magill of the Guards PMO of the division whose unfailing courtesy and zeal I wish to acknowledge that we were to pack up at once and carry all our patients to Johannesburg for the surrender had been made In an hour and a half we were readyall our sick and wounded packed into the waggons and tents struck We joined a long convoy and started passing through the overground works of gold mines whose names are famousSimmer and Jack Gelden huis Deep and othersalong coaldust roads and under a sun that blistered ones face and lips The line of waggons and troops extended for miles and marked its advance by clouds of dust The inevitable blocks occurred but at last we came upon scattered residences then into treelined suburbs then gradually into streets of brickbuilt houses and shops We were in Johannesburg Ic stirred my heart as I rode along to realise that I was taking part in this great triumphal procession It was some thing new to enter a town prepared for siege We had passed scores of skilfully laid trenches oh the outlying slopes that had never been occupied We were now looking upon the preparations of the town itself for an investment that never came The streets were practically deserted by white people The British had been turned out long ago  the burghers were off to the war  those that remained were in the main of other nations with perhaps indifferent feelings  at least they were stolid as they gazed The Kaffirs scantily dressed sat at the corners and stared eagerly at the locust army Here and there some men and women looked from a balcony  and a few go 3d Samaritans gave water or tea to the sick or the marching men But there was no sound save the tramp of men and the rattle of wheels and arms I do not know what happened when the great chief himself entered at the head of his splendid troops  but at our part of the column there were no sounds of welcome On the part of the soldiers there was apparently only aroused interest there were no cheers or jibes  the men moved on in steady stream only silently exultant that they were victors after long and fearful hardships The houses of business almost without exception were closed Huge barricades of wood or corrugated iron covered the windows and doors All showed what the stress of war can bring to a civil community I rode ahead along the long streets in order to reach the hospital The Union Jack was flying in the great square opposite the public buildings and half a dozen fluttered from as many houses That was all the bunting I saw The people whose sympathies were with the victors had been appealed to by the late official paper to curb any feeling of rejoicing in the hour of triumph and they certainly did not offend I got to the hospital at 5 oclock and found the resident medical officer to be a Dublin man Dr Pearce The building is really palatial and splendidly equipped in every depart ment Nothing could be better than the operating theatre There are 400 beds and the income is about 40000 a year The patients were received and refreshed with great prompt ness One of ours did not survive the tiresome march The nuns were most kind and the celerity with which the hundreds of sick and wounded were got into their comfortable beds was admirable For ourselves we had eaten nothing for nine hours and even our needs were attended to We left at 8 oclock for the camp Our authority told us that the distance was two miles I have noticed many times that distance is very elastic in South Africa You are told that you have to go two miles  you march four and become bewildered  then you are toldthis time trulythat yon have still five miles to go So it was now We struggled on in the dark after others on the same errand as ourselves  but at 12 oclock we could not find any sign of the division We were told it was five miles off so we outspanned till morning We were all thoroughly tired out We found next day that hundreds were in the same plight as ourselves and the brigade hospitals were still behind us In this march we have admitted to hospital 159 patients and many of these were sent back by convoy but we carried 30 for several days Most of the cases were enteric and the wounded did not present any special feature to which I need allude They all did well We only lost one case of fever on the last days march Of my 3 dressers 2Dr Pounden and Mr Percy Stewart are in the town hospital with enteric They as well as nearly all the staff had been inoculated This makes 7 who have been attacked but in no instance was the disease severe We have had two days rest in a beautifullywooded country and we are ready for another march The Engagement outside Pretoria We left our camp on Sunday morning June 3rd and marched towards the six mile drift The enemy were strongly entrenched there to contest the crossing On Monday June 4th we were early afoot but we reached the drift without opposition and got safely across We heard that the Boers had been forced out by the mounted infantry brigade early in the morning The road onwards led through sharply undula ting country with steep ascents and descents all the roads being exposed to commanding positions But our flanks were widely extended The small patches of trees were searched and we went on unmolested About 11 oclock I heard the boom of the first gun It was just ahead of our line Then came more firing and we knew we were at last engaged seriously A long climb brought us to the crest of a hill Right in front about a mile away I saw a battery of our guns on the side of a hill They were shelling a kopje about 2000 yards in front of them and the shells fell in showers upon it The Guards moved off to the right  while the 18th Brigade moved in advance and to their left Our road here turned sharp to the right and the waggons moved steadily on On July 21 1900ITHE COLONIAL DIVISIONUdw 183 the sky line a mile and ahalf away were the naval guns and the 18th Brigade had moved in front of these and lain down on the burnt veld Our orders were to bring the hospital on to the rear of the naval guard but on the near side of the brow of the slope Accordingly we pitched one large tent in a few minutes the others being drawn up at hand The firing had now become very heavy There was a chorus of pompoms from both sides punctuated by the loud booming of the naval and field guns and we looked with intense interest at the tragic work that was going on before us There was little smoke and that only from the big guns and bursting shells but the noise was deafening All I could see at this time was the flash of cannon a little smoke our own troops but no enemy They were hidden behind stone breastworks which had been prepared with deliberation for what was expected to be a fierce resistance The Hospital under Fire An ambulance returned bringing Commander de Horsey of the Monarchy who had been hit on the left malleolus by a shell splinter while bringing his 47 gun into action I was engaged in examining his wound when I heard the crackling shriek of a shell passing over the tent I looked up and saw another burst forty yards away Dr Kendal Franks came in just then and kindly assisted us in hurrying on the work A shell now fell between our mules and our tent waggon They were raining freely among the transport and I saw the drivers turn and lash their mules and oxen in retreat All over the place there were spurting columns of dust sent up by the bursting shells Someone had given the order for the convoy to retire Still the shells came They were being fired at the naval guns and missing these came plopping amongst us Once I saw a shell drop behind one of our own waggons which was moving away The mules jibbed and the waggon rolled and heaved I was sure it had been struck and I expected to see it fall to pieces but it was only rolling through a watercourse and it got away safely Then a soldier was brought in wounded in the face by a shell He had been standing outside the operation tent talking to one of our men when a shell burst and a fragment struck him badly in the face There was a big rectangular wound penetrating to the mouth and I stitched this up with Dr Franks assistance Then Colonel Magill came in and ordered us to retire for a mile The tent was taken down and packed and we hurried back to a new position where we received other wounded It was a hot quarter of an hour altogether but the only damage done was to the soldier At the naval guns them selves only one officer was wounded and two mules were killed The firing went on all day until night came The big guns fired at the forts at Pretoria and planted the shells un erringly Then the railway station was assailed and also the artillery barracks Once or twice the guns turned upon a near kopje and pounded it at 2000 yards to keep down the rifle fire Gradually the firing slowed and as evening fell silence followed The casualties were slight about 50 altogether Our hos Sital received the Duke of Norfolk who early in the day had is right hip dislocated by reason of his horse putting his foot in a hole The reduction was effected on the field under chloroform and he is doing very well A soldier was hit in the abdomen just below the last rib on the right side the bullet emerging at the left side of the last lumbar vertebra I had the advantage of consulting with Dr Franks and Dr Lowe a civil surgeon and we were unani mous in thinking that operation was not desirable He died next day In another case a man was wounded through the right kneejoint the bullet coming out just below the patella Beyond some effusion he has no trouble and the wound is healed In another case a bullet entered at the edge of Pouparts ligament  inch from the anterior superior spine I removed it from the right buttock 2 inches from the anus There were no symptoms In the case of a West Australian the bullet entered the outer margin of the right sternomastoid I re moved it from a point just below the occipital protuberance There were other cases of no special interest We remained by order on the field until Wednesday the troops having left on Tuesday The only excitement was the arrival of a party of Boers on their way to surrender One was a member of Kings Inns We gav them some lunch and soon after we followed them into Pretoria with our sick and wounded  Pretoria June 8th THE COLONIAL DIVISION UNDER BRIGADIER GENERAL BRABANT CMG By SurgeonLieutenantColonel Habtley VC PMO Cape Colonial Foices In the month of January it was considered advisable to form a division composed of mounted men presumably accustomed to South African manners and customs and led by Colonial officers It is not my purpose to discuss questions outside the medical bearings of the work done by this particular body of troops which was massed at Qneenstown Cape Colony and numbered some 3000 mounted men Organisation of the Medical Service The Imperial authorities having taken over the three vol unteer bearer companies of the Cape Medical Staff Corps one surgeon of the Cape Mounted Riflemen and the majority of the rank and file of the Medical Staff regulars of that regi ment there only remained a nucleus consisting of myself and one sergeantmajor to develop a medical service for this Colonial Division Kind friends had already subscribed a substantial sum for the purchase of ambulance wagons medi cines and medical comforts and it only remained to get them together and arrange them in some sort of order The general officer commanding also took the liveliest interest in the arrangements for the comfort of the sick and wounded of his division and was so good as to order his principal medical officer to spare no reasonable effort and expense towards the attainment of a happy result It was considered advisable to depart from the established custom of a distinct bearer com pany and field hospital and to combine the two It was thought from actual experience in the earlier months of the present war that much valuable time and material is wasted through men of the bearer companies being idle excepting when an action is taking place or at times when patients are required to be moved from field hospitals to hospital trains or ambulance wagons This is a subject which deserves the most earnest consideration of the War Office for future campaigns Recruits for Brabants Ambulance were advertised for in various colonial towns Some 80 men were collected in this way and an extraordinary medley they wererefugees from Johannesburg Germans French English Americans Jews etcfew if any of them having any knowledge of ambulance work drill or discipline But whatever their nationality or creed they have done admirable work both under fire in the field and in the hospitals There have naturally been some exceptions but the bad ones were soon found out and dis charged Then a more serious question arose South Africa is a very free country or to be absolutely correct considers itself so and the medical profession is not behindhand in the esti mation of its welldeserved freedom and resourcefulness in times of difficulty and emergency Finally a staff of 15 regularly qualified medical men were engaged only one of them having seen active service previously but all had been engaged in private practice in the Cape Colony and were conversant with the general run of diseases of the country Action at Dordrecht The first engagements took place on February 16th and 17th close to the town of Dordrecht 7 being killed and 9 wounded A temporary hospital was formed at a deserted farmhouse some five miles from the town So soon as the troops took possession the patients were moved into it including one Boer wounded in the thigh who had been deserted by his fellow patriots and left on the field to whatever fate might befall him It was only necessary to perform two amputations one through the upper third of the thigh and the other through the humrus both of which recovered without a bad symptom On the second day of the fight the ambulance waggons were moved three times in consequence of shells and bullets fall The War In South AfricaAuthors Frederick TrevesSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2045 Mar 10 1900 pp 59960720263713 1159 MARCH lo I9oo THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA vu JD 5991 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA AFTER SPION KOP By FREDERICK TREVES FRCS Consulting Surgeon with the Forces Spearman8 Camp on the Tugela February 7th 1900 SHELL AND SHRAPNEL WOUNDS As I mentioned in my last letter the wounded from the battle of Spion Kop on January 24th presented a very large proportion of shell and shrapnel injuries In spite of every possible care the shell wounds almost without exeeption have done badly We had over 30 deaths within the week after the battle and these were nearly all cases of shell injury The wounds are of the worst type contused and lacerated and very often contain dirt fragments of stone and even grass The men at the time of the battle had Bad a week of hard work and hardship and were unnerved by the terrible experience on the summit of the hill A good number of primary amputa tions were found necessary and a still larger number of secondary amputations As an example of the latter I may mention the following case AMPUTATION OF THE UPPER LIMBS BY BERGERS METHOD A man was wounded in the right shoulder on January 24th by a Mauser bullet at short range The bullet entered at the outer side of the limb about the centre of the deltoid muscle It passed through the ala of the scapula and was ultimately found under the skin near the vertebral column It was much distorted The tiMues at the back of the shoulder were abraded and con tused by a fall upon stone Dr Nuttal under whose care the patient was enlarged the wound and found great shattering of the humerus about the surgical and anatomical necks Permission for amputation had not been given by the patient and the limb was adjusted on splints The wound suppurated and the patient rapidly lost ground I was of opinion that an amputation of the shoulderjoint would hardly be possible owing to the state of the soft parts It was evident also that the head of the humerus was shattered The scapula was shot through I therefore proposed the amputation of the entire limbincluding the scapula and the outer two thirds of the clavicleby Paul Bergers method This operation I performed on February 3rd The joint was found to be full of pus and fragments of bone The patient has so far done very well I imagine this to be the first occasion upon which this operation has been done on the field COLOTOMY FOR WOUND OF RECTUM One case presented a curious complication A man was shot through both hips by a Mauser or a shrapnel probably the latter The lower end of the rectum was wounded in two places and in due course famces and flatus were passed through each of the gluteal wounds In one of these wounds the hipjoint was involved The wound in the rectum was easily felt on anal examination The mans condition was absolutely deplorable and his pain intense The question was should the case be left or should the lower end of the rectum be excised or should left colotomy be performed  We decided to perform colotomy and this was carried out by Dr Nuttal There were many difficul ties in the way of a direct operation upon the rectum WOUNDS OF THE THORAX Many of the wounds of the thorax have been attended by pneumothorax hmmothorax and empyema Taken as a whole this series of cases has done well THE TELEPHONE PROBE Before I left England Dr Hecleythe physician in charge of the electrical department at the London Hos pitalkindly lent me a telephone probe This instrument has been of the very greatest possible service and it has proved to be absolately reliable and very easy to manipu late As we have no Roentgen ray apparatus at the front I do not know what we should have done without this handy little instrument In compound fractures with comminution of the bone it is impossible by any ordinary examination to tell a distorted and brokenup Mauser from a fragment of bone The probe reveals the metal at once and will detect the smallest fragment I have a piece of a Mauser picked out of a compound fracture by the probe which has precisely the feel to the finger and common probe of a fragmentary bone The news has just reached us that a Roentgen ray appa ratus is on its way to this field hospital ABDOMINAL OPERATIONS But little encouragementattends upon abdominal opera tions i The first argument agaiiot laparotomy rests with the fact that a very large number of cases in which the patient has been shot directly through the abdomen have re covered perfectly without operation As examples of such recovery I may mention the following Point of entry near navel and point of exit by side of second lumtar vertebra Entry directly over stomachand exit by upper part of right loin i Entry in anterior part of one loin and exit in other loin Entry at tip of eleventh rib and escape through the opposite axilla 2 The second point is this The Mauser is apt to make a small hole in the bowel which hole maybe closed by appo sition with an adjacent coil of intestine 3 In the third place abdominal operations are not very easy in a place where the supply of water is very limited and where washingas of towels etcis difficult to pro vide for Major Kirkpatrick has surmounted these obstacles in a very able manner but still they cannot be quite got over The appliances I took with me for abdominal operations get over all difficulties as to really efficient and sterile sponges sterile silk etc and a sterile instrument tray and sponge dish They also provide a reliable means of making a carbolic solution The whole tin is so small that three can be carried in a capacious coat pocket They are however still far from perfect 4 In the fourth place the injury in many of the cases is very extensive As an instance I may quote the follow ing example A man was knocked down by a Mauser in the engage ment of Monday February 5th I witnessed the engage ment and saw the rifle fire and shell fire to which the men were exposed He was hit at long range and fell about I PM He was brought into hospital on a stretcher having been carried by hand all the way He came in at 530 PM having had to wait until the infantry and field artillery had retired I saw him at once He was blanched and somewhat collapsed His pulse was small He answered all questions promptly He had had an in jection of morphine when picked up and had vomited twice There was still much pain but the abdomen was quite flat There was evidence of considerable peritoneal haemorrhage The wound was a Mauser wound and was over the left tenth rib in the midaxillary line There was no point of exit but a wellmarked ecchymosis of the right parietes at the tip of the right twelfth rib suggested the position of the bullet The case seemed favourable for operation and I carried out a laparotomy by median incision at once The following condition was found FraeturA nf tAnh rib 1rePrLPA hn1 in tha QnlAan annr 1 iheo 1C C U eEC

upper jejunum 4 inch long four holes entry and exit in the jejunum at its very commencement a hole in the lower part of the right lobe of the liver All the five wounds in the bowel were carefully sutured the smaller holes requiringin addition to a continuous suture of the mucous membrane from 3 to 6 Lembert sutures I found the bullet lying loose under the liver The wounds in the solid organs had ceased to bleed and were not touched The whole peri toneal cavity was flushed out with hot water which had been passed through a Berkefeld filter after having been boiled The operation of necessity occupied a considerable time The patient died shortly after he was removed to his tent THE OPERATING TENT I may say that these operations are done practically in the open air that is under the shelter of a widelyopened square tent The light therefore is good A great trouble is from flies they cover the surgeons hands and with all care cannot be kept from alighting on exposed intestine etc The flies in this camp are nearly as bad as they were at Frere where they constituted a real plague THE LEEMETFORD We have a certain number of wounded Boer prisoners in the hospital and it is evident from their wounds that the IeeMetford bullet is not so merciful as the Mauser GENERAL WOODGATE I am sorry to say that General Woodgate is not progres sing favourably and is indeed losing strength I had to remove the damaged eye The General is free from pain but is seldom really conscious although he recognises his friends and answers a few questions THE TELEPHONE PROBE The following description of the telephone probe taken from Dr Hedleys recent work on Therapeutic Electricity and Practical Muscle Testing toRether with the accompany Dg illustration for the use of which we are indebted to 1W Hedley and to Messrs 3 and A Churchill the pub lishers of his book will explain the construction of the probe to which Mr Treves refers  It was de Wilde a civil engineer who I872 first pro posed the use of the electric bell as a signal of a metallic body in the tissues An improvement on this is the tele phone probe Its action depends on the difference of potential between two different metals and upon the delicacy with which the telephone will disclose an electric current so engendered A thin sheet of pure silver is placed upon an indifferent part of the body and attached by means of a wire having a telephone in circuit to a silver probe or heavilyplated exploring needle If the probe be inserted into the tissues the telephone is silent because there is no difference of potential that the tele phone will register but immediately a metallic body other than silver is touched there is a fall of potential a current is produced and the telephone indicates the fact Used to verify the localisation of foreign metallic bodies whose presence has been shown by radiography this probe is a strikingly effective device THE BASE HOSPITAL CAPE COLONY FRoM OUR SPECIAL COBESPONDENT AT CAPETOWN February 14th 1900 NEw BEARER COMPANIES CAPE MEDICAL STAFF CoiPs IN my last weeks letter I was compelled to point a few minor details in which it seemed as if the extraordinary strain of the campaign was apparently overtaxing the per8onnel of the medical authorities The only wonder is that more weak spots have not been evident considering how fruitful this war has been in surprises and how utterly it has falsified all expectations as to its duration and magnitude When we reflect that Great Britain has never during the whole course of her national existence put into the field forces of anything like the magnitude of those engaged in the present campaign and that it has to be carriecd on in a country singularly deficient in natural resources and in means of communication it is possible to form some estimate of the difficulties which have met the medical authorities in common with their colleagues in every branch of the service It is not too much to say that everything in this war has to be carried on under what are experimental conditions If until the experiments had been tried the British taxpayer had been asked to equip and maintain an army medical establishment sufficient to deal with the present crisis he would have retorted that such a premium was an altogether fantastic measure of national assurance But it is satisfactory to be able to note the extent to which the authorities here have developed the improvising faculty Even the small defects which I mentioned last week and which I hardly thought were remediable are being so rapidly put straight that in a week or two they will be probably nonexistent It has often been said by Colonials that the British soldier is hidebound by tradition and will not deviate one inch from the beaten track This war certainly disproves that assertion so far as medical matters are concerned The capacity shown for original arranigements has been simply marvellous Since my last letter the startling but manifestly commonsense departure has been taken of determining to practically break up the bearer companies of the RAMLC substituting therefor newlyraised companies of the Cape Medical Staff Corps and thus setting free the highly trained regulars for ward work at the hospitals As I pointed out in a previous letter hospital orderlies cannot be improvised whereas bearers can The average citizen can be taught stretcher drill and first aid in a week or two and got to take to it very creditably Months will not make him a decent hospital orderly except he be under the perpetual supervision of a superior The moral of this has been acted upon Companies D and E of the Cape Medical Staff Corps are now being rapidly drilled and trained and will be fit for the front in another week or so I hear that probably another company will be raised at once and more will follow if required The men are sbaping better than I at first thought they would Major Nicol RAMC of the 2oth Company which is now being broken up as a unit is supervising the training of these compinies and is I under MInbH 10 I900o THEE BASE HOSPITAL CAPE COLONY L j 60i stand to take command of D Mr Fryer a South African practitioner who has been acting as one of the civil surgeons at the

permitted by the Cape Government to leave his civil appointment when his company was mobilised has now obtained the desired leave and is to take command of E I have not heard of any other appointments having been made The projected equipment by the local St John Centre of a bearer company has for some reason or other fallen through This is I think a pity as it would have been a veryeffective way not only of showing patriotism but of rendering real ser vice The Centre would have been in a position to get excel lent men and the very fact of the company being raised and equipped by the Centre would doubtless have induced a class of recruits passed pupils to come forward who would not volunteer in the ordinary way So soon as these volunteer companies are in working order they will set free a very valu able accession of strength of the Royal Army Medical Corps available for the hospitals WOODSTOCK STATION HOSPITALs In other directions the authorities have shown their com mon sense in not hesitating to break up units to meet the special requirements of the situation and provide personnel where it is most needed No 5 General Hospital is I under stand not to be mobilised its personnel is at present scat tered to the ends of the South African earth Some are in Natal some with French some with M4thuen and some down here Major Gibson of that unit is temporarily attached to the Woodstock Station Hospital where his services are extremely welcome as the administrative work is becoming too much for Major Tuke This hospital is being thoroughly remodelled and is fast becoming quite equal to any demands laid upon it Four new wocden huts are about to be erected making a total of six of these structures which are excellently adapted for the pur pose and will enable the marquees to be vacated as the rainy season comes on Some old buildings are being thoroughly reconetructed and adapted for infectious and lunacy wards The huts are hygienically perfect and should be most com fortable in both summer and winter A completely new system of drainage for these buildings is being laid out under Colonel Supples supervrision And in connection with these altera tions a systematic classification of the patients is being made All the more serious medical cases cases of enteric fever in a ward of their own pneumonia acute rheumatism and the like are located in one of the wings of the permanent build ing and the 6lite of the nursing staff including the sisters whom I mentioned last week are attending to them Five more nurses of the Army Reserve are expected almost imme diately to be followed I understand by five more For the accommodation of these ladies a whole block of quarters hitherto occupied by the commanding officer and other officers and staff is to be set aside the former inmates being put on lodging allowance The civil surgeon who attends to outside work and who has other quarters will continue to reside onthe place a very excellent arrangement securing the presence of one medical officer in addition to whoever may be the orderly medical officer of the day The medical staff has been strengthened so that seven executive officers are availablea number amply sufficient for present needs especially as recruit exattrination is likely soon to be out of the way With these  new srrangements and a further strengthening of the orderly personnel this hospital will compare most favourably with any civil hospital in the Colony and will be able if required to ac commodate fully 5oo patients Another little point I must menti9n for the benefit of those who have their doubts about the feeding of Tommy when sick The chief cook of No 5 General a Swiss chef of undoubted attainments and drawing I am told a salary of 150 per annum has been taken on at Woodstock ENTERIC FEVER A number of cases of enteric fever but especially of pneumonia and acute theumatism continue to come into this hospital from the transports Very good results are being obtained all round especially with the enteric cases very few of which have had any dangerous complications The medical officer in charge of this ward informs me that he relies principally upon Yeos chlorinated quinine mixture and seldom administers stimulants earlier than the third week If pneumonia occurs he promptly adds digitalis to the quinine He draws attention also to the factknown to all South African practitioners of experiencethat high tem peratures have by no means the same clinical significance as in England Patients keep a temperature of from ko40 to IO50 night after night with a clean tongue a clear head and a good appetite and do splendidly after all He never uses any galenical antipyretics and only in rare cases resorts to sponging with a lump of ice in flannel South African enteric is a very puzzling thing Spots are quite seldom met with and the temperature very rarely takes the characteristic curves But the enlarged spleen is almost constantly present and often furnishes the only diagnostic sign If any severe diarrhoea comes on the indigenous drrtg Monsonia ovata or better if obtainable Monsonia Burkei brings about admirable resuks There are several cases of phthisis in the hospital mostly traceable to previous pneumonia A project is on foot to provide an openair treatment for them as it would be a pity to send them to England just now ENGAGEMENT OF COLONIAL NURSEs About forty Colonial nurses have already been engaged by the department to accompany invalids to England These ladies are paid 2 per week until return to Capetown with all found a very liberal remuneration considering the little element of pleasurethat must enter into such a trip A very careful selection has been made only nurses with undoubted qualification being engaged Several Colonial nurses have also been taken on for other work INCOME TAX One notable concession has just been made to the local civil surgeons and other local officers partVeipate in the benefit Hitherto income tax has been deducted from the pay of these gentlemen Against this one of the civil sur geons protested on the ground that he had no English domi cile and did not come under the purview of the Board of Inland Revenue The Field Marshal adopted this view and ordered the deduction to be suspended pending communica tion with the War Office These little concessions do much to create a good feeling SURGICAL CONVALESCENTS AT THE WYNBERG HOSPITALS There is little doing at the Peninsula General Hospitals N O I especially is practically a convalescent home A some what interesting case which I think I mentioned in a former letter is now almost well It is remarkable as showing the results obtained even with bullet wounds other than the Mauser The man was wounded at Belmont a sporting bullet striking just over the right eye ploughing through the frontal bone and emerging in the right temple Numerous frag ments of the frontal bone and much sloughing skin were found portions of the frontal lobe were removed and a good deal of cerebrospinal fluid escaped This escape of fluid con tinued for some days There were never any signs of fracture of the base The wound was gently irrigated with warm boracic lotion at first weak perchloride and finally dusting with iodoform being substituted later At first there was total blindness of the right eye but now he has recovered per ception of form and colour and can count fingers although he cannot make out details The range of vision is limited irregu larly An elongated detachment or rather separation of the retina is shown by the ophthalmoscope He was very drowsy at first but the temperature never rose above ioo and that only early in the case The intellect is now perfectly clear He vomited early in the case He had a few spasms in both lowerextremities early and the left hand and leg are still weak Facial movements are diminished en the left and the right orbicularis oculi is partially paralysed I may mention that fragments of bone continued to be extruded for some time He was not trephined A rather notable case of fracture of the thigh is still in the wards A wedgeshaped fragment was as shown by radiography forced out of the line of con tinuity and lodged against the edges of the two portions of the bone forming a sort of buttress to the broken limb at The War In South AfricaSource The

through many editions on the Continent within forty years  it won the high praise of Galileo Gilbert has been called the father of modern electricity by Priestley and the Galileo of magnetism by Poggendorff When the British Association last met at Bradford in 1873 the modern theory which largely reverts to Gilberts way of formulation and refers electric and magnetic phenomena to the activity of the ether instead of attractions at a distance was of recent growth  it had received its classical exposition only two years before by the publication of Clerk Maxwells treatise The new doctrine was already widely received in England on its own independent merits On the Continent it was engaging the strenuous attention of Helmholt z whose series of memoirs deeply probing the new ideas in their relation to the prevalent and fairly successful theories of direct action across space had begun to appear in 1870 During many years the search for crucial experiments that would go beyond the results equally explained by both views met with small success  it was not until 1887 that Hertz by the discovery of the ethereal radia tion of long wavelength emitted from electric oscillators verified the hypothesis of Faraday and Maxwell and initiated a new era in the practical development of physical science Animal Electricity Professor F Gotch delivered an evening address on Animal Electricity He said that animal electricity if strictly inter preted had a most extensive scope commensurate indeed with all forms of animal life The study had however a special significance in connection with one class of living structuresnamely those which constituted the nervous system There was absolutely no doubt that organs of an essentially nervous type existed the prime object of whose activity was the production of electrical disturbances Such were the electrical organs found in a few groups of widely different fishes Every electrical organ was built up of columns containing a vast number of special structures arranged in series and to make these essential features clear and at the same time to bring forward all known instances of electrical fish a series of slides were shown As to the characters of the organ shock Professor Gotch exhibited a living specimen of Malapterurus which had been lent for the purpose by the Liverpool Corporation Museum through the kindness of the director Dr Forbes Experiments were made to show that the shock of the fish could effect the mercurial column of a capillary electrometeriand that in this way photographic records of the shock could be obtained Such photo graphic records showed that each shock was multiple that is to say the electrical organ once it had been made to produce its shock would go on doing so automatically The power of each blowin other words its electromotive forcewas astounding in a fish about 8 inches long Pro fessor Gotch had determined that under favourable conditions the first electrical disturbance could reach a maximum of 200 volts and that this could develop in twothousandths of a second This astounding voltage would be produced when the electrical effect in each single disc reached only four hundredths of a volt Illustrations were then given of the mode of following the electrical disturbance occurring in a nerve during the passage of a single nervous impulse from a very large number of experiments made in conjunction with Mr G J Burch FRS Professor Gotch said that it appeared that the nerve electrical effect was very similar to that present in each disc of the electrical organ Finally he Drought forward evidence to show that there must be at electrical disturbance in the nerveendings of the orgar whenever a nervous impulse might be produced out side the nerves The astounding effects produced by the electrical organs of fishes thus had their physiological counterpart in nerves  and in this as in other departments of natural science Nature showed no gulf Next Meeting The meeting of the British Association in 1901 will be hele in Glasgow under the presidency of Professor A W Rucker FRS

The report of the Court of Inquiry held at Pretoria last June to inquire into the treatment of British prisoners but more especially of sick prisoners in the hands of the Boers in and near Pretoria which was issued by the War Office on Sep tember 12th together with Lord Robertss observations thereon makes very disagreeable reading Lord Robertss comment with reference to the treatment of sick prisoners is as follows  a The inhuman treatment of the sick prisoners throws the greatest discredit on the authorities at Pretoria who must have been aware that proper hospital accommodation and equipment had not been provided that suitable food and medical comforts were not forthcoming and that the supply of medicines and medical appliances was wholly insufficient That the deficiencies referred to in the correspondence were to some extent made good by the exertions and liberality of private individuals does not exonerate the Government of the South African Republic from its respon sibility in this matter and the indifference which was shown to the suf ferings of the sick among the British prisoners is the more inexcusable when it is remembered that the sick among the Boer prisoners have in variably received the same care and attention as our own sick soldiers Lord Roberts adds that the efforts of Drs P H Haylett and R von Gernet to ameliorate the condition of their patients and the assistance rendered by burghers and British civilians by whom a fund to supply the deficiencies was raised are the only gratifying features in the correspondence He adds on the other hand  that it would be difficult to condemn too strongly the conduct of Dr H P Veale MBCambridge whose heartlessness in ignoring the dis graceful treatment of the sick prisoners and the remon strances addressed to him by the medical officers in imme diate charge of them calls for the severest reprobation Dr Yeale in his evidence stated that he along with Drs Knobell and Lingbeek were the three medical members of the Transvaal Branch of the Geneva Red Cross Society Dr Veale was responsible for the care and medical attendance of the prisoners of war at the racecourse but denied that he had anything to do with the sanitary arrangements although he admitted that it would be his duty as medical officer attending the sick to notice and try to remedy anything in the arrange ments of the hospital or its precincts prejudicial to health He stated that he did bring several points to notice and con sidered that everything in the racecourse hospital was reason ably satisfactory when he left at the beginning of December Dr P H Haylett who was appointed to take charge of the hospital at the racecourse in December stated that there was no adequate provision of medicines considerable difficulty in obtaining stimulants and no means of keeping the hospital buildings clean The refuse of the hospital was left close to the buildings there were no sheets and but a few pillows In January he went out to Waterval as medical officer for the prisoners there and at once reported in writing to Dr Veale condemning the sanitary arrangements the water supply and the hospital building and its equipment Eventually protests having been unavailing Dr Haylett resigned and in February Dr Rudolph von Gernet was ap pointed in his place Dr Gernet stated that he found the I prisoners housed in sheds built of corrugated iron open towards the front and with leaking roofs The central road I was higher than the floor of the sheds so that the rain water drained into them and the men were lying in water on the bare ground The surroundings were in an indescribably filthy condition The latrines were within 50 yards of the night camp in which the men slept These latrines which consisted of trenches were filled by the heavy rain and the contents were floated all over the place  The supply of drinking water was insufficient the prisoners were clothed in rags and though the building used as a hospital was satisfactory the furniture was absolutely un satisfactory For 60 inpatients and 20 orderlies there were only 21 bedsteads 11 mattresses and 49 blankets Nearly all the sick were lying on the floor without bedding or pillows and there were 41 typhoid cases for whom there were no suit able medicines The food supply of the hospital was insuffi cient Dr von Gernet took vigorous action and brought the de ficiencies before the notice of the Committee charged with the care of the prisoners This Committee acted promptly 77 MBjSL THE PLAGUE Sept 15 1900 and President Kiuger took an interest in the question so that eventually the defects noted weie remedied It there fore appears clear that had Dr Yeale shown at an earlier date more vigour and independence and better appreciation of the responsibilities he had accepted these defects would have been earlier remedied THE MOOI RIVER HOSPITAL NATAL We are indebted to Mr Charles S S Johnston architect of Edinburgh for the following extracts from a communication which he has received from Major Henry H Johnston RAMC giving some particulars as to the results of the treatment of enteric fever at that hospital It will be re membered that an interesting account of this hospital from the pen of the late Sir William Stokes was published in the British Medical Journal of April 28th In that paper is embodied a note by Major H H Johnston describing the pre cautions taken to prevent the spread of enteric fever Major Johnston writes as follows  Since No 4 General Hospital was opened on January 6th 1900 there have been up to the present date August 10th a total of 6581 patients treated in it and 207 deaths For wounds received in action there bave been 1707 admissions and 46 deaths  operations 222 For enteric fever 1150 admis sions and 114 deaths The mortality from enteric fever has been 10 per cent which is very low and as there are only 2 patients dangerously ill out of the 51 enteric fever patients re maining in hospital the percentage mortality from that dis eae will not be perceptibly increased In addition to the admissions for enteric fever there have been a large number for socalled simple continued fever many cases of which were probably mild cases of enteric fever but from which there bave been no deaths If these doubtful ases were added to the admissions for enteric fever the per centage mortality for the latter disease would be still lower than what I have mentioned The enteric fever patients have been well looked after in this hospital They are treated in double  roofed and walled marquees with wooden floors and there are six beds in each marquee There is one nursing sister for every six marquees 36 patients and in each marquee there are two ward orderlies from 6 am to 8 pm and one orderly from 8 pm to 6 am The night orderly is on duty for a week at a time  he has hot chocolate and biscuits at 2 am and he has no day duty to perform during his weeks turn of night duty This system is in finitely better than that of making the orderlies throughout the whole hospital take their turns of night duty in addition to their daily work because under the latter system which prevails throughout the army the orderlies are fatigued and sleepy at night after their days work and there is also the risk of orderlies from the surgical wards having their hands contaminated with enteric excreta and infecting patients wounds The favourable results obtained in this hospital are due to the good hygienic conditions under which the patients have been treated in a healthy bracing climate 4550 feet above sea level under the skilful treatment of the civil surgeons the care and devotion of the nursing sisters and orderlies with the abundant supply of milk and other articles of food of good quality suitable for enteric fever patients The drinking water for the whole hospital is obtained from the Mooi river and it is passed through a large automatic PAfiteurChamberland filter containing about 350 filtering tubes The soldiers especially those of the regular army have been very good patients cheerful and always ready to submit to any operation that was recommended by the medical officers They have received liberal diet and extras and many presents of tobacco notepaper fruit fish biscuits etc from publicaid institutions and private individuals From June ist to July 31st the maximum temperature in the shade in a Stevensons screen 4 feet above the ground has ranged between 50o F and 74o F by day and the minimum in the same situation between  F and 53o F by night The greatest daily range was 50o F on July Ttb when the minimum was 15 F and tbe maxinr urn 65o F The lowest range was Io F on July 31st when the minimum wfs 53 F and the maximum 61  F on a cloudy day There was frost on 20 nights in June and on 18 nights in July Rain fell on 3 days in June and 5 days in July but with tbe excep tion of a heavy shower on the night of July 2425U1 only a few drops fell on each occasion In all the occupied hospital marquees there are single and duplex  Diamond  oil stoves burning all night for warming purposes Major Johnston appends copies of the orders for the over seer of Indians

the casualties repoited by Lord Roberts from Belfast Transvaal under date of September 9th we regret to notice the name of Major G Hilhard R AMC C MG who was severely wounded near Doom h op on September 6th Major Hilliard succumbed to his wounds in the General Hospital Newcastle on September 7th Major Hilliard was appointed SurgeonCaptain February 5th 1887 and Major twelve years thereafter He served in Ashanti under Sir Francis Scott in 18956 and received the star granted for that expedition He went to the God Coast in 1895 and proceeded thence to the Cape of Good Hope in the following year remaining in South Africa until his decease He had nearly completed hi839th year We also regret to observe that among those reported missing on September 5th after the action near Warm Baths is Mr A Cradock Fry LRCP MRCS MA MB BCCantab of the 9th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry Red Cross Society At a monthly meeting of the Cape of Good Hope Society on September 3rd Sir John Furley Chief Commissioner of the Red Cross Society said that he had recently visited the hospitals in Pretoria Johannesburg and other centres and that he found the arrangements for caring for the sick and wounded most excellent All had abundant supplies He spoke in glowing terms of the grand work accomplished by the London Central Committee and hoped that it would become a permanent organisation The result of the co operation of the civil military and hospital organisations had been very gratifying Sir John Furley added that the strain was now practically over and he considered that there was no further need of appealing to the public for subscriptions but he admitted that private assistance was necessary and would be welcome THE PLAGUE GLASGOW There are 16 cases of plague under treatment in Glasgow an increase of 3 during the past week No deaths have occurred from the disease during the week Four capes are under ob servation as suspects and 113 persons are detained as con tacts The source of the epidemic has not yet been discovered though there is a general feeling in favour of some connection between it and shipping Nothing so far has been discovered to indicate that the rats have had anything to do with the infection Careful investigations are being made on this point and the rats which are being killed in large numbers in the infected area are subjected to pathological and bac teriological examination by Dr R M Buchanan the city bacteriologist but up to the present with negative results Prevalence of the Disease India

A NOTE ON THE SOCALLED POISONED BULLET By G H Makins FRCS Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force in South Africa Pretoria July 5th 1900 Fob some months past the waxcoated bullets employed by the Boers and discovered amongst captured ammunition have been a source of both interest and anxiety particularly to the lay mind in South Africa To the evil action of these suspected missiles many a case of suppuration and cellulitis has been ascribed By this time the appearance of the cartridges may be familiar to many of your readers but to such as are not a short description may be of interest It has apparently been the custom both by tht Boers and some ammunition manu facturers to coat the bulet with a layer of wax I believe on the theory that the missile in consequence takes the rifling more readily while at the same time the lubrication pre serves the grooving of the barrel from wear by friction How rapidly the latter takes place is patent to those who were familiar with the deep grooves seen on extracted Mauser bullets at the commencement of this campaign and can con trast them with the many almost smooth bullets met with at the present time  and when the hardness of the casing of the bullet is considered one would not expect it to be other wise Beyond this the Boer seldom cleans his rifle and the wax left may act as a preservative against erosion The wax coating of the various bullets I have seen differs in tint In the older large leaden bullets a white wax has been employed and the wax remains uncoloured except where fouled by contact with dust Many cartridges I have seen have had a coating of white wax applied which appa rently from age and perhaps the conditions under which they have been stored in hiding has acquired a brownish tinge Of the greencoloured bullets I have seen two varieties  in the first and less common white wax of some kind has been applied both to the bullet and brass case of the cartridges and probably from exposure to damp the latter has acquired an incomplete coating of verdigris which has become irregu larly diffused into the wax coating  in the second and more common variety a greentinted wax is employed in the original coating cases of cartridges treated in this way are numerous As to the composition of this wax I am unable to furnish any information but in support of the innocuousness of the pro cess I may only first repeat the opinion I expressed on a former occasion that the surface of the bullet clearing its passage through the grooves of the rifle is almost completely renewed only the extreme tip and base being untouched while th velocity with which the missile is started is such as to make it probable that the tip itself would be cleansed by the flight through the atmosphere This view as to the clean liness of the surface of the bullet has been most thoroughly confirmed in the case of the coated ones by an experiment performed by Captain Mitchell Wood at Capetown as long ago as last March A greencoated bullet fired by the Mauser rifle was made to traverse a book of white paper and then bury itself in a bank of sand As a result when the book was examined no trace of the green wax was found on the margins of the per foration in the paper and the casing of the bullet itself al though somewhat split was perfectly clean and white The complete disappearance of the wax is no doubt partly to be explained by the heat generated during the passage of the bullet through the rifle which although insufficient to cauterise the tissues is yet great enough to fuse the wax and in part to the actual scraping of the surface by the rifling of the barrel The Wounded at Pretoria Only the wounded from the Diamond Hill engagement have been in hospital in Pretoria hence I can give little surgical information of interest The service hospitals here are located in the Model School the Girls School the Volks Hospital and a building known as the Burke Hospital while the Irish Hospital has found a home in the splendid new Palace of Justice Enteric fever is still the mo3t prominent disease but its incidence is now happily on the wane THE LATE MISS KlNGSLEY I must not close this note without paying a modest tribute to the memory of Miss Kingsley of whose sad death I have only yesterday become aware Early in the year Miss Kingsley came to me with an introduction from Sir Lander Brunton although I had had the privilege of her acquaintance in England My wife at that time nursing at Wynberg took Miss Kingsley to the SurgeonGeneral who offered her the post of nursing the sick Boer prisoners at that time at Simons Town Miss Kingsley undertook this difficult work with characteristic energy she donned a Boer hat provided herself with a stock of cigarettes of special composition and battled with one of the most severe epidemics of enteric fever that has occurred out here The difficulties to be overcome were great but she overcame them all working with untiring cheerfulness and success infusing her own spirit and thorough ness into those working with her and gaining the hearts of the patients depressed and unhappy in their captivity and suspicious and fearful as to their disease The most arduous part of her work may be said to have been over when she was struck down with the same disease herself She bore her ill ness with the greatest fortitude and when the fatal perfora tion took place she courageously grasped her last chance and underwent an operation by Mrs Snowden Much as the t u geon dreads one of these operations and confident as I am that she was in the best of hands I cannot but feel a personal regret that I was too far distant to be able to fulfil her wish that I should undertake this for her It was perhaps characteristic of Miss Kingsley that all she asked was that if she had to die that  she should be allowed to die alone and that she should be buried at sea To so great a traveller and so ardent a lover of Nature these desires seem both fitting and natural and she has found her last restingplace in the sea that she loved and among its denizens who formed her chief interest in the realm of Nature I think we as a profession may all be proud that the daughter of one of our brethren did such noble and disinterested work out here and met her death as a real heroine Miss Kingsleys remains were accorded the rare if not unique honour for a woman of both a military and naval funeral The military service having been performed on shore the coffin was placed on board HMS Thrush and committed to the deep with naval honours some 20 miles from the shore SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS From our Capetown Correspondent The Woodstock Hospital July 18th 1900 As the No 5 General Hospital at Woodstock is the one at which the principal work at the base is being carried on and as it has probably reached somethuig like its final stage of development a somewhat detailed description of it may be of interest if only from the fact that it constitutes now the nearest South African approach to a general hospital at home Moreover as a reference to some of my previous articles will show it has grown from very small beginnings in the course of the present war a fact that goes some way to prove that the army medical officials can bring constructive ability to bear upon occasion The position as I have pointed out before is not a good one either from the sanitary or the aesthetic point of view and perhaps its only recommendation is that it is in close proximity to the railway station Situated on a lowlying piece of shore on which nothing will grow it is dusty and wind swept in summer a swamp in winter and noisy at all times But for the ordinary work of a garrison station hospital it was handy to the castle and the main barracks and no one foresaw that it would ever have to be turned into a general hospital The best had to be done with the only available site and apparently the best has been done  The hospital now consists of the permanent building that is the original station hospital an old and somewhat ram shackle double storeyed brick building large huts smaller ditto and marquees with a few bell tents The old building consists of two wings each containing four elevenbed wards two on each floor with a large central block used as quarters for medical officers and nurses with small wards for prisoners isolation and ophthalmic cases and a number of stores and offices Some of the latter are housed in a recently erected iron building in one of the quadrangles The wards are roomy and airy enough and their bareness has been much relieved Aug i8 1900INOTES FROM THE SEAT OF WARmAKSu 445 by a number of little accessories and decorations some sup plied by authority others by the outside public No reason able objection canbe made to them on the score of cleanliness for the most scrupulous care is evident in regard to this point but from the age of the building the floors are necessarily worn and dingy and superficial observers might rashly assume them to be dirty forgetting that no amount of scrubbing can make old floors look white The wards on each upper floor are approached by roomy landings used normally as lounges for the more or less convalescent patients who in the rainy weather now prevalent in the Cape peninsula cannot spend much time in the open air On occasions of exceptional pres sure caused by the sudden arrival of large drafts of convales cents from up country beds are occasionally made up on the floors of these landings but this never lasts more than a few days pending departures to England and certainly no dis comfort to speak of has been endured Each set of wards has an annexe for cleansing purposes and another as a sisters room On the ground floor of each wing of the permanent building is a dispensary serving the left and right divisions respectively The total capacity of the permanent building is somewhat under 100 beds There are six principal huts substantially built of iron lined with wood floored and lighted as is the old building with electric light These are most comfortable and in fact preferable in many respects to the main building Each of these huts has 36 beds There are four huts of iron of a more or less temporary nature less substantially built than those just named but comfortable enough for the class of patients mostly conva lescents sent into them Their capacity is also 36 each There are also 7 portable huts built in sections of 25 beds These could easily be taken down and reerected in a very ehort time There are 2 infectious huts of 10 beds each well built and floored with wood Some infectious cases are occa sionally put into bell tents An observation hut for 10 patients and a number of marquees and bell tents all woodenfloored complete the accommodation for patients which totals up to 804 Two of the large huts are specially set apart for enteric cases and a fair proportion of the beds in the permanent building are also allocated to the same disease Generally peaking one of the groundfloor wards in the main building is reserved for surgical cases and the other seven wards are as far as possible devoted to serious medical cases Of course classification is most difficult to carry out with the sudden influxes of patients from up country but it is enforced as far as possible The dining hall is an iron structure capable of seating more than 200 patients The convalescents take their meals there and it is also used for Divine service and for recreation purposes including concerts which by the praiseworthy efforts of the outside public are frequently given There are eight or ten Boers at Woodstock at present accommodated in a separate hut All are absolutely con valescent and being fed up on luxuries galore Indeed the dietary throughout the hospital is liberal to a fault extras being absolutely unrestricted and practically every man gets every thing he asks for unless precluded by actual medical reasons A commodious operating room of iron is now being erected There are libraries attached to each set of wards There is a postoffice in the old building The staff now consists of LieutenantColonel Williamson in command Major Russell secretary and registrar Majors Gibson and Saunders in charge of divisions  one Militia BurgeonLieutenant who acts as company officer  one Volunteer SurgeonLieutenant holding a temporary commis sion in theRAMC  and 10 civil surgeons besides a quarter master The nursing staff consists of the superintendent who has also sole charge of all gifts contributed from outside and 13 Sisters Part of these are accommodated in the hospital and part in a hired house near by The detachment consists of 1 RAMC warrant officer 3 etaflsergeants RAMC 2 staffsergeants VMSC and 1 St John Ambulance 6 sergeants VMSC and 3 St John sergeants 48 corporals and privates RAMC n Militia M8C corporals and privates 75 VMSC corporals and privates and 33 St John men Four of the Militia privates are specially enlisted compounders and of course a large number of the company are employed in the kitchen stores and offices The RAMC warrant officer is assisted by an acting sergeantmajor who takes his duties at night and two sergeants are engaged as wardmasters during the day and one at night Two nursing sisters and about 20 men are per manently engaged on night duty supplemented by special orderlies as occasion requires An orderly medical officer is constantly on duty all the officers below the divisional officers except the senior civil surgeon taking turns on this roster The orderly medical officer likewise visits the castle cells A medical officer detailed for outside duties at the barracks and amongst the castle staff is attached to the No 5 unit but does no hospital duty and is not included in the list of the staff given above The professional staff is amply sufficient to ensure the most careful attention being given to every case and they are a very well qualified set of gentlemen one being a MRCP of London The subordinate staff is pretty heavily worked and a good manyan average I believe of about 20are con stantly noneffective through sickness mostly enteric Three orderlies have died from this disease already Regimental orderlies are now and then drafted in to fill the gap tem porarily caused by illness No nurses have contracted enteric and only one medical officer and his case is clearly traceable to postmortem work The general conclusion one draws from a look over No 5 is that the patients are comfortable and exceptionally well fedfar better indeed than the average rich civilianand that here at least no foundation exists for the strictures passed upon the medical administration A Campaign of Criticism A new development of the campaign of criticism has come out in the publication of a letter accusing the medical officers at Wynberg and elsewhere of partiality in their selection of cases for invaliding but on the whole there is a general dis position not to anticipate the investigations of the Com mission Personally I do not think that Commission will find much evidence of preventable discomfort to patients although it may be able to suggest some modifications in Army Medical organisation whilst the testimony of the large number of civil surgeons at present employed may throw some light on the etiology of the paucity of candidates for com missions in the RAMC As an instance of the loose way in which statements are circulated to the detriment of the Department I may mention that some weeks ago it was announced in the Cape Times that the secretary of the Soldiers Christian Association had re ceived a request from the principal medical officer of one of the military hospitals for shirts socks and warm clothing  badly  required for the patients and inviting the public to send to the said secretary any such articles This of course gave the impresion that the principal medical officer in question could not get these necessaries from official sources and had to appeal to outside Now as a matter of fact there is an ample supply of all these articles at the hospital in question but the secretary voluntarily offered some pyjamas and other things which were naturally gratefully accepted and on his offering to supply more he was told that they would be thankfully received but nothing in any way approaching an appeal was made or was necessary NOTES FROM THE SEAT OF WAR From a Correspondent The Commission of Inquiry from a South African Stand point On the whole medical officers in South Africa manifest but slight interest in the forthcoming Committee of Inquiry This is no doubt due to the fact that one and all feel convinced that the inquiry will result in a complete vindication of the RAMC It may perhaps also lead to the introduction of a few muchneeded reformsreforms which have already been advocated by many of the officers If these are conceded in a liberal spirit they will undoubtedly tend to strengthen and consolidate the corps and will prove beneficial in every way There can be little doubt that the inquiry will still further 446 mJ NOTES FROM THE SEAT OF WAR Aug 18 190a bring home to the nation the sterling quality of the medical and surgical work which has been done during the campaign and will in this way also tend to strengthen the position of the corps From telegrams published here it would seem that Mr BurdettCoutts has now qualified his original statement by announcing that it was not meant as an attack on the personnel of the RAMC but applied only to the system This however is rather a lame explanation for the system is the  personnel in the sense that without the system the personnel could not exist as it exists today Without the system the personnel if it existed at all would be an untrained and more or less useless body Mr BurdettCoutts doubtless meant that his attack was directed against the corps as at present constituted and not against its individual members It is presumed therefore that the attack was started with the object of weakening and discrediting the corps thus causing its overthrow and erecting on its ashes a renovated regimental system which is still the chimera of the  combatant  officer Think what it would mean if Mr BurdettCoutts were to accomplish his object always presuming that his object is as above stated A corps of highly trained officers and men who are always ready to proceed to any place where their services may be required would be split up into its individual atoms if I may use such a term and distributed in twos and threes amongst the regiments which now form our army They would become isolated units incapable of collective action tied to their regiments however urgently their services might be required in another direction In other words we should have returned to the medical organisation which existed in the days of the Crimea Where then would be the general the stationary and the field hospitals whose work during the campaign will probably survive as a record in military surgery which will be pointed at with envy by Continental armies For criticise the administration of individual hospitals as we may the fact remains that the collective surgical results of the cam paign have been successful in an eminent degree A Typical Field Hospital Several detailed descriptions of general and stationary hos pitals have been published from time to time from which it j will have been seen that these units are equipped on a scale corresponding to station hospitals in England and that they are as a rule models of neatness and comfort Hitherto field hospitals have been more or less overlooked by your corre spondents I am therefore induced to send the following brief notes on an inspection of one of these hospitals as doubtless they will prove interesting to your readers especially as there is reason to believe that recent adverse comments have been mainly levelled at these units What follows however will tend to show how little justification there is for such adverse criticisms In this case the unit selected was No 15 Field Hospital it being the only representative of its class then stationed in Bloemfontein Before entering on its description I may premise that a field hospital is equipped for 100 patients it is attached to a brigade and moves with it wherever it goes It is essential therefore that the equipment should be as light and portable as possible This consists of field medical and surgical panniers an operating and thirtynine circular tents etc To insure lightness and portability the medicines are in tab loid form All told the equipment weighs roughly 8 tons and can easily be carried on four ox or five mule waggons A field hospital receives the sick from its brigade and all wounded that may be brought to it oy the bearer companies The serious cases are transferred to the base as soon as pos sible only slight cases which are expected to be fit for duty in a few days being retained in the hospital This rule how ever has been frequently modified during the present cam paign as in the following instance  Before leaving England No 15 Field Hospital was detailed for duty with the Fifth Irish Brigade It landed at Durban on December ist 1899 the officers with the unit being Major G H Younge in command Major F T Wilkinson Captain E M Pilcher Lieutenant R H S Fuhr Lieutenant and Quartermaster J Hirst Having drawn its transport at Pietermaritzburg the hospital joined its brigade at Frere on December 8th 1899 and was present with it at the battles of Colenso Spion Kop Yal Krantz Pieters Hill and the relief of Lady smith The hospital was subsequently ordered to Bloemfontein Since arriving here it has been attached to the Third Division and has been detailed to treat the sick from the various rest camps and from the drafts which are continually passing through the station It rapidly became filled with enteric fever cases and to accommodate these additional tents and equipments had to be drawn The hos pital now consists of 65 tents 18 of these being marquees The camp is pitched on a level plain west of the town It is rectangular in shape and covers an area of 140 by 250 yards The bell tents are pitched in six rows with an interval of 16 yards between each row the marquees in two separate rows on the south side of the camp On the south side also corrugated iron latrines and a large washstand and on the east a pretty corrugated iron cookhouse have been erected From whatever point the camp is viewed the tents are in perfect alignment with a broad avenue between each row As the tents are snow white and the site smooth and well kept the whole forms a neat and pleasing picture In rear of the camp are the mortuary tent a marquee for hospital stores the horse lines etc The marquee is kept well stocked with large reseives of medical comforts and warm under clothing which are issued liberally to the patients whenever necessary The sanitary arrangements receive especial atten tion The camp is scrupulously clean not even the tiniest scrap of paper being visible All refuse is at once burnt all waste water being emptied into a deep pit filled with broken stones through which it rapidly percolates Chloride of lime is freely used for disinfecting the waste water For excretions and clothing izal is almost exclusively em ployed Large supplies of both are on hand The hospital is now almost entirely occupied by enteric fever cases and the marquees are reserved for these Three nursing sisters are doing duty in the enteric fever wards Each marquee is 14 by 30 feet They are provided with double roofs and walls and comfortably accommodate 7 beds Those in use in the hospital are wirewove spring beds which are found light portable and very comfortable The beds are placed round the marquees at right angles to the walls This leaves a large space in the centre in which stands a long table In the centre of this is an elevated tray on which are placed feedingbottles medicine bottles etc The remainder of tbe table is covered with books and illustrated papers Beside each bed stands a bedside table The marquees are bright and neat and every article in them is spotlessly clean The floor of each marquee is covered with a double layer of tarpaulin which is found safer more comfortable and much more convenient than wood Each bell tent accommodates three beds arranged so as to form three sides of a square The patients are provided with mattresses blankets sheets and pyjamas Most of them are now convalescent and those who are allowed up wear the regulation blue hospital clothing in which they look neat and smart One and all speak in the highest terms of the treat ment they have received and express indignation at the charges which have been brought against the hospitals in South Africa I append a few figures which have been jotted down from the hospital returns They will show that although field hospitals are only equipped for 100 patients they are capable of doing much good work Since its arrival in South Africa the followingare the numbers which have passed through the hospital  Gunshot wounds Simple continued fever Enteric fever

Again another astrologer had connected the various parts of the body with the different stars and planets  thus the sun stood for the right eye the moon for the left and the star under which a child was born determined the part of the body which would eventually suffer When ultimately these doctrines were put to the test by an unbelieving public a writer went so far as to add a chapter as to how to overcome misrepresentations and doubts on the part of patients Prosthetic Apparatus after Excision of Lower Jaw In the Dental Section Dr Witzel Dortmund showed a patient a child in whom he had resected the whole of the lower jaw In this case an artificial jaw was inserted imme diately and became fixed in its position and to a certain extent performed the work of the natural jaw Epidemic Dysentery and the Dysentery Bacillus Professor W Kruse Bonn stated that dysentery so far as Germany was concerned dated from the war of 1870 Some 30000 soldiers were then affected 3000 dying The returning troops spread the disease throughout the country and since then it had not disappeared Various local epidemics were described which in different localities had in one year caused the deaths of 100 to 150 persons During recent years the disease had shown itself in a larger number of areas which caused the Government to commission the speaker who had eight years experience in Egypt to study the disease at home Last July he had occasion to witness an epidemic and perform eight postmortem examinations on victims of ithe disease In the case of Egyptian dysentery Kruse estab lished the existence of a certain amoeba which however he only once discovered in the above cases On the other hand from the faeces he had obtained a bacillus resembling closely the typhoid bacillus Inoculation of animals which readily suffered from dysenterycats and monkeysgave no results The Egyptian bacillus was found in small intestinal ulcers but his recent cases showed a membranous formation These indications were given as an incentive to further research in this direction Pathological Changes in Bile Dr Brauer Heidelberg stated that former knowledge of bile was based entirely upon postmortem examinations On the other hand observers could now by means of fistulae make comparative investigations some of which as for instance those with phosphorus were fairly wellknown He had never found sugar in the bile of healthy individuals but it was discovered in cases of diabetes diseases of the pan creas and after its removal In cases in which parenchyma tous changes of liver tissue took place these products had been traced in the bile Thus in cases of alcohol poisoning alcohol acted detrimentally on the liver substance and the bile showed epithelial cells Antidotes Dr J F Heymans Ghent said that an antidote should not only arrest the action of a poison but also arrest and reduce the symptoms of poisoning He then proceeded to give some examples such as the administration of oxyhydrate of iron in cases of arsenic poisoning In this case only the poison re maining in the stomach was affected Again an antitoxin had no effect on the toxins circulating in the blood but only pro tected the cells from the further injurious effect of such poieons and therefore was only preventive As a more striking in stance he described the result of poisoning by potassium cyanide in an organism previously saturated with sodium hypophosphite As no effect was produced it might be assumed that a certain amount of free CN which was circulating might change to CNS which was far less harmful in the case of the rabbit for instance 100 times less poisonous Conclusion Hamburg has been chosen as the next meeting place of the Congress and officers were elected for the various sections As previously stated some hundred papers were down for reading and it would be impossible in a small space to even give the names of those that have not been referred to Every section however was full of interest and a specialist would have heard a large variety of subjects discussed in his respec tive department that of obstetrics and gynaecology for in stance being particularly well supported by eighteen speakers with original papers The Congress passed off very well and seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed by those present THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA THE IRISH HOSPITAL AT PRETORIA By Sir William Thomson SurgeoninChief Pretoria September 18th Dr Colemans Services in the Actions outside Pretoria I have just seen in print the notes which I sent you late in June from this place They were written under great pres sure and were unrevised I am aorry to see that I have made one important omission In describing our work in the action outside Pretoria I have failed to mention the services of my colleague Dr Coleman My staff had been so depleted by illness that I was able to send only Dr Coleman and a few orderlies with the stretchers and ambulances That duty he did every day when fighting was expected and when our division was actually engaged he was always well to the front with his men fearlessly doing whatever the circumstances of the moment demanded My bearerssome constabulary and some civilianbehaved also with great coolness and bravery and I had to use threats to only one Cape boy driver who pleaded that he did not come out to be shot Results of Three Months Work Since I wrote to you last the Irish Hospital has completed nearly three months work in Pretoria and I am able to give you some figures as to the results Up to August 31st we had admitted 1593 patients of whom 445 were enteric cases of these last 52 died showing a mortality of 116 Deaths from wounds were 84 and from other conditions 091 At Bloem fontein where a section of the hospital remained under Dr George Stokers charge until June 22nd 150 enteric cases were treated with a mortality of 126 Deaths from wounds were j 5 per cent and there were no deaths from other causes The total number treated in the stationary hospitals which there fore does not include fieldhospital work at Prieska or on the advance to Pretoria was 1864 with a general deathrate of 48 It is right to state that 6 enteric cases died within 48 hours of admission and 4 within 72 hours  these were in the last stages of exhaustion but they are of course included in the figures given Up to September 13th the admissions to the Irish Hospital in Pretoria were 1813 1313 were dis charged 70 had died and 430 patients remained under treat ment In his evidence before the Commission at Bloemfontein the Principal Medical Officer General Wilson gave the following particulars as published in the repoi t The deathrate of wounded at the Irish Hospital was 73 per cent whereas at the Liangman it was 715  at No 5 Stationary Hospital 698  and at No 9 General Hospital 494 whereas at the Portland it was 733 The enteric deathrate was  At the Irish Hospital 1316 percent at No s Stationary 1519  and at No 9 General 1405  whereas it was at the Lang man 1878 percent andat the Portland

SCOTTISH RED CROSS HOSPITALOpt 13 190a Statement of some local nurse which has been published in England that she  would be ashamed to lose a case of enteric That kind of wild statement carries its own contra diction But the return shows once more how fallacious sta tistical results may be and what a false impression they may convey I have learned that all febrile conditions which can not be otherwise classified are put down as enteric At all events in the detailed lists which are before me only one fever rheumatic other than enteric is noted On the other hand tne Army Medical Department have a class for simple continued fever It will be seen at once how the inclusion in one set of figures diminishes the apparent deathrate and how in the case of the army returns the grouping of fevers increases the apparent deathrate of enteric There is un doubtedly a form of fever which whether it is essentially enteric or not has not any of the characteristic symptoms of that disease It is obvious that the only way of arriving at a result such as that now published from Bloemfontein would be to include all febrile conditions under one heading Of course it would be unscientific but it would be a result arrived at from similar premisses Although this hospital happens to stand first on the results I think the returns given by the principal medical officer are distinctly satisfactory everywhere when the conditions pre vailing in a campaign are considered and they will compare favourably with those which are obtained in the best hos pitals at home Prospects for Spring and Summer The decrease of enteric cases goes on and we now get down to about one fifth instead of onehalf of our admissions The deathrate too is steadily falling But we are now in the springtime already the temperature is distinctly warm Pretoria looks at its best for the young grass is brightening the veld and various blooms and the tender green of expand ing leaves make softness and brightness everywhere But alas we have yet to face dust storms then rains then myriads of flies which already are beginning to infest our rooms  and to make things worse local authorities assure us that we shall have a second outbreak of enteric The season for malaria too is just opening along the line of railway to Koomati and there will be an increased death roll Hospitals are being instituted at Middleberg and other places east of this Hospital Accommodation at Pretoria In Pretoria itself there is at least at present as much ac commodation as is required No 2 General under Colonel Keogh the Langman under Mr Gibbs the Imperial Yeomanry under Dr Sandwith  the Welsh Hospital under Professor Hughes and Nos 1 2 and 3 at the State Model School under Major Cummins and other officers of the RAMC are now well equipped and at work The No 2 General Hospital the Langman and the Welsh are grouped on the veld two miles out overlooking the town They have been well fitted tents and streets are lighted by electricity and all the essentialsgood beds and good kitchensare present The Yeomanry Hospital occupies a private house with some 40 beds and these are supplemented by numerous marquees which accommodate 200 patients There is of course in all these cases plenty of room for rapid expansion and therefore I think we are not likely to have the experiences of Bloemfontein repeated here The Hospitals Commission The Royal Commission to inquire into the charges concern ing the hospitals in South Africa arrived here from Bloemfon tein on September 8th and forthwith proceeded to take evidence On September 10th and 1 ith they spent some hours in visiting the hospitals and inspecting the wards What impression these made upon their minds I cannot say but I do not think the most fastidious critic could find any indication of inhumanity in the treatment of the patients in Pretoria Every consideration is given to them and I am on the other hand able to say that there are no better or braver patients than our soldiers It is a pleasure to treat them they are so docile and grateful I am sure that is the impres sion that  Tommy  has made upon the civilian doctors at all events and if he has been hardly treated now and again it has been for reasons that were overmastering I THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL RED CROSS HOSPITAL By Henry E Clark FFPSG Surgeon in Charge  Professor of Surgery St MuDgos College Glasgow Kroonstadt ORC Sept Uth 1900 The Temporary Hospitals at Kroonstad This hospital has been settled at Kroonstadt since the end of May The first detachment consisting of the staff and equipment for 100 beds reached Capetown on May 12th the date of Lord Robertss entry into Kroonstadt and this cir cumstance determined our destination I was myself sent forward by the night mail on May 15th with four doctors and seven nurses the condition of matters at Kroonstadt being urgent but the railway line was so seriously damaged beyond Bloemfontein that we were detained at that town five days During that time the rest of the staff and the equipment went round to Port Elizabeth disembarked and actually reached the capital of the Free State on the day we left it to go on My party reached Kroonstadt on the morning of May 25th the only change in our arrangements made at Bloemfontein being that six studentorderlies of the Scottish Hospital staff and the nurses of No 3 General Hospital were sent on the Scottish nurses being put on duty at the Bloemfontein hos pitals I shall never forget the scene presented by the tem porary hospitals at Kroonstadt when we arrived There were about 600 patients in the town nearly all suffering from enteric fever These occupied the Dutch Reformed Church numerous bell tents in the compound round it the Town Hall the Grand Hotel and the Kroonstadt Hotel The schools were used as a hospital before the arrival of the British and continued to be so used being worked by a RussianDutch ambulance The patients in these buildings lay for the most part on the floor Some had mattresses but many had none and they were thickly crowded together clad in their ordinary garments and wrapped in their own blankets Until we arrived there were no nurses excepting at the RussianDutch ambulance and but few orderlies There were 7 medical attendants including 2 Russian surgeons and a local doctor  but there was a deplorable lack of medicines medical comforts bedclothing and personal clothing for the patients I recognise that these conditions were unavoidable and have nothing but praise for the admirable work accomplished by Major Ford and his stafi under peculiarly trying circumstances I agreed to take chargeof the Kroonstadt Hotel Temporary Hospital and continued to have charge of it till it was vacated Although I had come out with the idea of doing surgery I could not refuse to take my share in the treat ment of enteric fever patients seeing that the conditions were such as I have described o 3 General Hospital and the equipment and the rest of the staff of the Scottish Hospital reached here two days later May 27th and from henceforth the condition of matters speedily improved In a marvellously short time the temporary hospitals were put in a satisfactory condition and the tent hospitals were soon able to take in all the new cases of disease and injury The Completion of the Scottish National Red Cross Hospital A month after the sending off from Glasgow the first de tachment consisting of 100 beds a second section consisting of the staff and equipment for 210 beds was forwarded and still a month later a third section of 210 beds to make up the full complement of 520 beds for a general hospital Thus our hospital has become the largest voluntary hospital sent out with the exception of the Yeomanry Hospital During our short stay at Bloemfontein we had visited the hospitals and had marked the prevalence of enteric and were not sur prised to find a like condition of matters at Kroonstadt Bullet and Shell Wounds Our dreams of interesting surgical cases and valuable ex perience of bullet and shell wounds seemed likely to be dissip ited but thanks to the energy of Christian de Wet we got a fair share of bullet wounds from Rhenoster Lindley Bethlehem

WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA THE BATTLE OF COLENSO FROM A CORRESPONDENT IN NATAL THE PLAN OF THE ATTACK AT the battle of Colenso which was fought on December Isth 1899 there were roughly about 20000 British troops engaged These included about I6ooo infantry 3000 cavalry and artillery and some iooo irregular cavairy The plan of attack was that the Fifth Brigade under General Fitzroy Hart should force its way across the Tugela river and try to turn the right flank of the enemy At the same time General Bartons Brigade was to endeavour to cross the river further down and to seize a steep hill on the left flank from which they could enfilade the Boer lines General Hildyards Brigade were to make a froat attack on the position whilst General Lytteltons was held in reserve The Boers were strongly entrenched amongst the steep kopjes around Colenso the centre of the position being Fort Wylie which stands just behind the village of Colenso The battle was begun at 535 AM by a shell from one of the naval guns This was immediately followed by a terrific fire from our guns which was maintained throughout the action At times Fort Wylie appeared as an actual sheet of fire from the bursting of our shells The Boer artillery fire was com paratively ineffective and many of their shells failed to burst Their musketry fire was reserved until our infantry were little more than 500 yards from their position when they were assailed by a perfect tempest of bullets The Fifth Brigade under General Hart being most exposed to the fire suffered severely NATURE OF WOUNDS The Fifth Brigade Field Hospital under the command of Major G H Younge R AMC had quickly 24 officers and 285 noncommissioned officers and men admitted with bullet wounds The following analysis of these wounds according to the region involved is interesting Head I9 face 7 neck 3 back and spine 20 upper extremity 76 lower extremity i I8 other wounds 6 From this it will be seen that wounds of the lower extremity greatly predominated Of the 309 only 8 were returned as shell wounds the remainder were without ex ception caused by Mauser bullets The wounds caused by these bullets were humane in the extreme The wounds both of entrance and of exit were small and presented a clean punchedout appearance being almost entirely free from contusion or laceration Amongst the cases brought to hospital haemorrhage was conspicuous by its absence In Major Younges field hospital only 4 cases of gunshot fracture were admittedi of the femur I of the humerus and 2 of both bones of the leg In none of these were the bones extensively comminuted and it is more than probable that all 4 cases will recover with useful limbs Many of the wounds were curious and interesting One man presented symmetrical Mauser bullet wounds one inch below the centre of each clavicle Both bullets passed directly backwards but no wounds of exit could be found In another case a man was struck whilst lying down The bullet entered near the centre of the parietal bone passed downwards and forwards through the brain the orbit and the hard palate and was found projecting beneath the skin behind the symphysis menti from which region it was removed without difficulty by Major F T Wilkinson RAMC There was extensive effusion of blood within the orbit which caused marked protrusion of the eye and lids The patient was per fectly conscious could give an accurate account of how he was wounded and on the following morning was able to walk without Aifficulty to the stretcher on which he was carried to the hospitaltrain TREATMENT IN THE FIELD HOSPITALS In only a few cases was it found necessary to perform opera tions in the field hospitals As the cases arrived the wounds were washed with perchloride lotion and dressed with double cyanide wool and gauze Long before night fell the whole of the wounded exceeding 6oo in number were comfortably lodged in the field hospitals On the day following the battle the wounded were trans ferred to the stationary and base hospitals with a celerity which was absolutely marvellous In effecting the transfer the greatest assistance was given by the Volunteer Ambu lance Corps of iooo men which was organised at Maritzburg by Colonel T J Gallwey CB RAMC THE CONDUCT OF THE RAMC UNDER FIRE During the action many acts of heroism were performed by both officers and men of the RAMC Conspicuous amongst these was that of MajorW Babtie CMG CAMC who rode through a tempest of bullets to succour a number of men of the Royal Artillery who lay wounded and exposed to the enemys fire Wherever the fire was hottest there were to be found medical officers attending to and dressing the wounded with as much coolness and skill as if they were in the wards of a hospital In all I saw 3 cases which were brought to the field hospital without dressings and in almost every case the dressings were applied with a neatness and precision which would have done credit to any hospital The rapidity with which the wounded were dressed and removed from the field by the bearer com panies was the subject of favourable comment on all sides The ambulances were several times fired on by the enemys guns and several of them were damaged by fragments of shell yet the medical officers worked steadily on with a devo tion and heroism which was beyond all praise THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNNER IX HEALTH OF LADYSMITH THE thrilling news of the splendid defence made by the garrison at Ladysmith at least shows that whatever condition a certain number of the garrison may be in the healthy and fighting men are as good as ever they were Nevertheless reports now make it certain that the epidemic of typhoid among the garrison is of a serious character Thus on January 8th and gth no fewer than I6 deaths from dysentery and typhoid were returned One correspondent writing early in December says that of his battalion of 550 go were down with typhoid fever In the face of this heavy mortality there is little doubt that the water supplies used by the troops have become contaminated Prob ably the heavy rains which invariably mean surface drainage into wells and streams have contributed to this contamination We can scarcely suppose that the latrines themselves are so placed as in any way to imperil the purity of the water supply At any rate from some cause or another it is evident that this pollution has occurred and in this con nection it is of interest to note that the troops are all supplied with filters For protection against typhoid filters cannot be relied upon under conditions of camp life The best remedy against an infected water supply is boiling the water and we fear very much that considerable difficulty may be experi enced in a camp in inducing soldiers to use this precaution but at the same time looking to the heavy losses now entailed it is certain that vigorous measures to enforce this practice wherever practicable should be used The British losses in the engagements on the 6th and 7th are fortunately smaller than we had been led to anticipate 13 officers and 135 men are reported killed and 28 officers and 244 men wounded Here the proportion of killed is unusually high and is doubtless due to the handtohand character of the fighting which occurred on Wagon Hill and elsewhere The Boer losses are stated differently in every report which reaches us so that it is impossible to arrive at any accurate information but we may rest assured that the forces engaged in attacking our positions must have lost very heavily ORANGE RIVER From the Orange River which may be taken as the base for the operations on the western border of the Free State it is interesting to learn that the health of the troops is thoroughly good and a Renter telegram of January 8th states that during the preEent lull in the fighting the hospitals there are almost empty All the serious Lcaes have been sent to the field hos I62 M B1t JOUNIL THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA  20 1I90 pitals at Wynberg Large quantities of medical comforts including mineral waters preserves fruits tobacco and furniture and clothing are stored in each of the hospitals and are much appreciated by the men who are keenly sensitive of the great kindness shown them by the donors The inhabit ants of Cradock a town on the Karoo forwarded over 200 worth of goode for the sick and wounded This is satisfactory on every ground as there are a number of Dutch in the Cradock districts whose loyalty has sometimes been called in question PHYSIQUE OF THE YEOMANRY AND VOLUNTEERS One of the questions which has been raised in reference to the various yeomanry and volunteer corps now going to South Africa apart from their military qualifications for the work in hand is as to their physical fitness for the task before them On this ground I do not think much anxiety need be felt The climate of South Africa is on the whole healthy and invigorating and men accustomed to outdoor exercises such as are enjoyed by our town middle classes and yeomanry have all the qualifications for this outdoor life In many respects the volunteers and yeomanry now proceeding to South Africa will have the same qualities as the colonists who havebeen of such excellent service in the field although they cannot of course compare with the colonists in experi ence of the country and the peculiarities of South African life Nevertheless this knowledge will be gradually acquired by them and the yeomanry and volunteers will form excellent material out of which most valuable forces for warfare in South Africa will soon be made FIELD AMBULANCE FOR MOUNTED TROOPS In the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of January I3th is an interesting article by Dr Caverhill SurgeonMajor to the Lothians and Berwickshire Yeomanry Cavalry describing an ambulance scheme for the mounted service In this article the writer argues with considerable force that on tactical humanitarian and surgical grounds the bearer company with cavalry or mounted infantry should itself be mounted and that it should be provided with fittings for transporting men sitting or lying down either in a regular or improvised man ner and should have sufficient surgical appliances The special mobility and rapid movement of a cavalry force ob viously require equal facilities for movement in its surgical staff and bearer companies The flying hospital suggested by Dr Horace Manders is as stated in the JOURNAL of January i3th to consist of a hospital car and an ambulance car constructed on the principle of the Irish jaunting car each to be drawn by two horses attached to a pole on the same modification of the curricle principle as that adopted in the Cape cart The Cape cart is a hooded fourseated vehicle on two wheels Any wheeled ambulance which could be moved rapidly about the field and was capable of following the movements of cavalry must undoubtedly be of advantage and in many respects the proposed car is excellent At the same time I would point out that a long experience of driving over all sorts of roads and over the veld itself in South Africa has convinced me that no twowheeled vehicle in the world can compare for a moment in either comfort or safety with one having four wheels In driving over the veld at anything but a walk two dangers are constantly presenting themselves the ant heap and the ant bear hole Both of these occur over almost the whole of the South African veld and either of them is capable of readily upsetting a twowheeled vehicle It iaight be urged that a careful driver or postillion would naturally avoid both these obstacles But a man who whether as postillion or coachman is driving a vehicle across the veld has his attention con stantly distracted to some distant object In warfare I take it he would have to keep his eye to some extent upon the enemys lines In hunting of all sorts where the Cape cart is frequently used and in which I have had some experience of its use the drivers attention is constantly taken up by watch ing the troop of buck or other object of the chase and one of the wheels is very apt to run over an ant  heap or drop into the grasscovered and almost entirely concealed antbear hole without much warning In this way many capsizes occur On the other hand if a stronglybuilt fourwheeled American spider be used a capsize is almost impossible The Americans are a practical and ingenious people they have had the problem of the settlement of pathless tracts of country to deal with and I have no hesitation in saying that they have solved the question better than the South African Boers An old American engineer and pioneer once remarked to me on the subject of the Cape cart that it had fallen to his lot to travel in many countries and that he always went with an open mind prepared to discover that the peculiar institutions and appliances of various sorts adopted by any particular country had some special fitness for the purpose designed For a long time he had applied this principle to the Cape cart and racked his brains to discover its peculiar virtues and fit ness for the work required of it but he confessed finally that he had completely failed in this instance and that the prefer ence for a fourwheeled vehicle either in the shape of a buck board  spider or waggon over a rough and pathless country which obtains universally in America was undoubtedly rational The fourwheeled vehicle is invariably safer than a twowheeled and one wheel of an American  spider can be dropped into a hole or cross an ant heap or almost any other obstacle without absolutely capsizing the vehicle On these grounds I have no hesitation in saying that a spiderbuilt ambulance would be safer and more comfortable In conclusion I will merely add that personally I have twice been pitched out of a twowheeled vehicle in South Africa but never out of an American  spider which latter vehicle of later years I invariably used for all sorts of work SNAKES An article in the Spectator of January 13th contains the statement that among the casualties at Modder River were several cases of snakebite The snakes of South Africa it is added are both common and deadly cobras of all sizes pale yellow to black being the most active and dangerous One the Boers call the  Bpitting snake because they believe that it can spit the venom which oozes from its fangs I have not seen the reports of casualties from snakebite referred to although I admit that it is possible they may have occurred At the same time it must be pointed out that the number of deaths from snakebite in South Africa during a year are extremely small I have myself spent months on the veld and have been through a campaign yet during the whole of my South African experience I have only seen some three cases of snakebite ln the column in which I served through a campaign lasting some three months not a single instance of snakebite occurred in spite of the fact that the operations were conducted in the coast districts where snakes are most abundant The fact is that in South Africa the country is so bare that there is little cover for the snake which almost invariably makes for its hole on getting sight of man Snakes are fairly plentiful but they seldom attack unless trodden upon and they usually avoid being trodden upon by escaping in the manner described With regard to the spitting snake I can testify that this is no mere legend There is a small active snake which does squirt a poisonous fluid in this way and a case came under my notice in which a personal friend while stooping to pick up a stone with which to destroy one of these reptiles had this fluid squirted into his eye by such a snake a  ring hals Fortunately he was near a stream to which he rushed and in which he at once bathed the eye When I saw him the whole of the conjunctiva was acutely inflamed and remained in this condition for several days although the eye eventually ret turned to its normal condition THE RED CROSS ORGANISATION The need for a permanent central organisation for the con trol of voluntary relief was recognised by the formation early in 1899 under the auspices of Lord Lansdowne of the Central British Red Cross Committee under which the British Red Cross Society the St John Ambulance Brigade and other voluntary bodies are federated When the war broke out Colonel J S Young was sent out by the Central Committee to act as its Commissioner with instructions to make use of the ample funds and materials at his disposal as seemed best on the spot in cooperation with the Principal Medical Officer of the Field Force and with the local aid societies Lord Wantage who is chairman of the National Society for the Aid of Sick and Wounded in War has given some interesting de JAN 20 1900  THE WVAR IN SOUTH AFRICA Tim Boaz 16 tails of the work recently accomplished He refers to the excellent services rendered by Colonel Young who is work ing in touch with the Army Medical Service and with the local branch at Capetown under the auspices of Sir Alfred Milner He is also supplying warm clothing for invalids on their return journey The Society is engaged in equipping a convalescent home at the Cape for both officers and men a large extent of ground with suitable houses belonging to Sir James Sivewright has been generously placed by him at the disposal of the Society at Somerset West a beautiful and healthy site thirty miles from Capetown and eighteen from Wynberg with railway communication It can provide 200 beds which can easily be increased by huts or tents The Society is also establishing a convalescent hospital consisting of Doecker huts in the near vicinity of Netley Hospital The Society acts in con nection with the military medical authorities both at home and at the seat of war and thus forms the recognised channel for providing comforts etc for the sick and wouinded beyond what are supplied by the Army Medical Ser vice The Commissioner of the Red Cross Society has assured the executive at home that complete harmony exists between him and the officers of the Army Medical Service The promptness shown by them Lord Wantage adds in bringing the wounded down from the battefields to the hospitals at the base deserves the highest commendation Indeed the excel lence of the hospital field organisation in this campaign seems to be greatly in advance of that in any previous war One of Colonel Youngs letter from South Africa dated November 30th states that he had inspected the trains fitted up under the direction of Colonel Supple PMO These trains have been proved in the transport of the wounded from the engagements at Belmont and Graspan to be very efficient for the conveyance of the wounded over the long distances usual in the country He says One train carries 92 and the other 96 officers and men lying down in five carriages with passage down the centre all communicatling with one another and with carriages fitted one for carrying arms and kits one fitted as kitchen and pharmaey and a saloon carriage accommodating eight firstclass and 15 secondclass passengers two medical officers and two nursing sisters being provided for in this saloon with a portion of the other male attendants on the wounded The ventilation is admirable and I was only able to suggest the pro vision which I agreed to pay for of movable bed trays for the patients who could sit up to eat their food from I also provided an ice chest for one train at the request of Colonel Supple Furtheron Lord Wantage comments on the numerous applica tions for employment under the Red Cross which are made in many instances by fully qualified and trained nurses He points out that 4o qualified nurses were forced by the Boers to quit Johannesburg and are now in Capetown earnestly desiring to be employed Their case certainly seems a hard one and deserving of consideration should occasion arise for supple menting the navy or army nursing staff in South Africa THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE NONCOMBATANT FICTION The following appeared in the Morniny Post of January 12th  RAMC It is most necessary here to say a word in praise of the Royal Army Medical Corps who faced a hot fire all day long going close up to the firing line to bring back our wounded It seems almost incredible that during the day five hundred wounded men should have been brought back by the Medical Corps though to get them back stretcher bearers and searchers had to cross and recross a zone of fire at least a mile wide War Correspondent of the Morning Post at Magersfontein He marches with the rest of us he swaggers all the way His step aint right but his boots is bright and he draws a soldiers pay He wears a kit of a perfect fit and his figure is just

until a chaps ill But when our leg is broke in half and truth we must go sick He joins the strife with his long lean knife and cuts at the wounded quick His words are short but you cant pay court to one of a hundred such And we dont grouse when he wastes his nous on some of them groan ing Dutch 0 his hand it kind o soothes the pain when the eyes see onlv red He stays behind but he stays to

Sawbones a Tommys gone sick In barracks morning stables done on Saturday he comes We have to show our chests in a row and he looks between our thumbs We dont go sick for a horses kick but a bite when youre bending down Will make you feel as your goin to peel from the ball of your foot to your crown  And so we go to hospital and if he orders port A man lies low Are you better No you ought

roads go in this part of the country but it is very rough in places and several drifts have to be crossed At Frere the railway is reached FIRST WOUNDED ADMITTED On the Sunday after our arrival the

of from 5o to i 5o They were all attended to and were sent on to Frere as soon as possible All the serious cases were of course kept in the hospital THE ATTACK ON SPION Kop On Wednesday January 24th came the terrible affair of Eipion Kop I was awakened about 3 AM by the rifle fire attending the night attack upon the hill and all through the day the artillery and rifle firing was terrible and in cessant Spion Kop is just opposite the hill under the shelter of which our hospital stands and from this hill the engagement could be witnessed The hill is steep and was approached from the side of the river I watched our men climb up and it was evident that in certain steep places the getting of the wounded down would be attended with difficulty The shell fire to which our men were ex posed was very severe and it was clear that the casualties would be numerous Our hospitalwhen first we reached the riverwas made up of 6o tents and io marquees On Tuesday the order was given to increase it by IOO bell tents This meant additional accommodation for 5o0 patients No increase in the staff was possible Under the able direction of Majors Kirkpatrick and Mallins the arrange ments were complete on Wednesday THE WOUNDED FROM SPION Kop On Thursday the wounded came pouring in and they came in the whole day and until late at night until the hospital was full The number taken in that day was nearly 6oo We had already sent down some 300 so the casualties have been heavier than at Colenso In spite of the immense number of the wounded they were all got under shelter by Thursday night had had their more serious injuries attended to and had been made as com fortable as circumstances would admit They bora evi dence of the excellent work done in the field hospitals These hospitals bear the brunt of the trouble and carry out the first treatment They did splendidly on Wed nesday and Thursday The volunteer ambulance corps and the large body of coolie bearers did excellent service The larger number of the wounded were on the top of Spion Kop The path down was about two miles was steep and in places very difficult The carriage of the wounded down the hill had all to be by hand From the foot of the hill to the hospital the carriage was by ambul ance waggons and in some cases by coolie bearers All the stretchers had hoods There was no doubt that the wounded suffered much on account of the tedious trans port but it was rendered as nearly perfect as possible The surgeons who went after the wounded on the top of the hill told me that the sight of the dead and injured was terrible in the extreme the wounds having been mostly from shell and shrapnel some men had been blown almost to pieces The weather on Wednesday was warm but was not to be compared with the intense heat on the day of the battle of Colenso the temperature was that of a hot summers day in England Thursday was fortunately cloudy and much cooler THE NATuRE OF THE WOUNDS AND THE CONDITION OF THE WOUNDED As to the wounded there was the usual proportion of minor injuries but on the whole the wounds were much more severe than thosereneived at Colenso This is explained by the large number of wounds from shell and shrapnel The men moreover were much exhausted by the hardships they had undergone In many instances they had not had their clothes off for a week or ten days They had slept in the open without great coats and had been reduced to the minimum in the matter of rations The nights were cold and there was on nearly every night a heavy dew Fortunately there was little or no rain The want of sleep and the long waiting upon the hill had told upon them severely There is no doubt also that the incessant shell fire must have proved a terrible strain Some of the men although severely wounded were found asleep upon their stretchers when brought in Many were absolutely exhausted and worn out indepen dently of their wounds TTHE MEN ARE SPLENDID In spite of all their hardships the wounded men behaved as splendidly as they always have done They never com plained They were quite touching in their unselfishness and in their anxiety not to give trouble The English soldier is a man of whom the country may well be proud and in these two terrible engagements on the Tugela they behaved from first to last in a manner worthy of the splendid traditions of the British army A finer hardier and more heroic set of men could hardly have been gathered together They were much depressed at the reverse One poor fellow had been shot in the face by a piece of shell which had carried awayllis left eye the left upper jaw with the corresponding part of the cheek and had left a hideous cavity at the bottom of which his tongue was exposed He had been lying hours on the hill He was unable to speak and as soon as he was landed at the hospital he made signs that he wanted to write Pencil and paper were given him and it was supposed he wished to ask for something but he merely wrote  Did we win  No one had the heart to tell him the truth WOUNDS OF THE NECK AND HEAD The Mauser wounds showed nothing new The bullet at a long range acts more like a finepointed instrument going through bone without splintering it and dividing nerves and arteries with remarkable neatness One case showed a communication between the external carotid artery and some adjacent vein and another a communica tion between the common femoral artery and vein There were several wounds involving the neck in which the larynx was involved In one of these in which I per formed tracheotomy the lesion had been effected by a piece of shell and it was surprising that the patient could have survived the damage to the larynx and gullet He is so far doing well General Woodgate received a very severe wound of the head from a fragment of shell The piece entered at the outer angle of the right orbit and ploughed along the skull as far as the pinna It made a linear ragged gap in MARCH 3 1900 THE MILITARY HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG 1 oL1 535 the bone Much brain matter was escaping and the sight in the right eye was lost I opened up the wound and re moved all depressed and loose fragments of bone with a relief to the patient which is I am afraid only tem porary TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL WOITNDS The abdominal wounds are numerous Few are suited for operation I have seen on the one hand many in which a Mauser bullet has passed through the abdomen in almost every direction and in which recovery has followed without operation On the other hand abdominal sections are not very easily carried out on the field and I think the cases for operation are best limited to those in which the lesion is well localised and in which the bullet has escaped Bullet wounds of the liver have done well as also have like wounds of the kidney An officer with a bullet wound of the liverno exithas done well after passing through a serious crisis AMPUTATIONS Very few amputations are required for Mauser wounds Most of the amputations have been for shell wounds In some cases bullets other than the Mauser probably the MartiniHenry have been used Some of the compound fractures of the leg in both officers and men may yet need amputation Wounds do remarkably well in camp SHELL WOUNDS The shell wounds are the most terrible and the most difficult to treat One man had most of the face shot away including both eyes Another had the forearm shot off and two fearful wounds of each thigh dividing the anterior muscles to the bone The chest cases are numerous but do quite fairly One patient has developed pneumonia and others have pneumothorax or hremothorax So far there has been little gangrene In one case a shrapnel had opened the ulnar artery and the man came down safely with a tourniquet on his brachial composed of a plug of cake tobacco and the tape of a puttie Of the many curious tourniquets I have seen this is the most ingenious THE HOSPITAL NURSES AND ORDERLIES We have a few iron bedsteads in the hospital which are of great service and are much appreciated The great majority of the patients however are lying on the ground and cannot be dressed without difficulty As many as pos sible are accommodated on stretchers I have slept on a stretcher since I came to the front and can testify that they are most comfortable Miss McCaul and the two Netley Sisters have rendered invaluable service and have worked day and night It is hard to imagine what we should have done without them Three nursing sisters however can hardly cope with a hospital containing over 700 wounded men and the great mass of the work falls upon the orderlies who are a singularly efficient obliging hardworking set of men THE MILITARY HOSPITALS AT WYNBERG By Sir WILLIAM STOKES MD FRCSI WE have received the following communication from Sir William Stokes SurgeoninOrdinary to the Queen in Ireland and Consulting Surgeon to the Field Forces in South Africa describing a visit which he paid to the military hospitals at Wynberg in the neighbourhood of Capetown shortly after his arrival from England THE WOUNDED On January 25th I visited the hospital at Wynberg and was most courteously received by its Principal Medical Officer Colonel Anthonisz Accompanied by him and Mr Fox Symons who has had a large experience of military surgery not only in the late GrEecoTurkish but also in the present South African war I visited Nos I and 2 The number of patients at present under treatment is not very great owing doubtless to a lull in the hostWities during the past fortnight But still in the wards I found many cases of exceptional surgical interesttraumatic aneurysms injuries of nerves fractures of the femur tibia fibula and humerus and many cases illustrating the eccentric courses bullets take at times even invading the brain the thorax or the abdomen without destroying life One case struck me particularly The ball entered the skull above and behind the left zygoma passed forwards and downwards penetrating the orbit then entered the nasal fossa and ultimately emerged in the right submaxillary space without fracturing the lower jaw The patient has recovered but with loss of sight in the left eye There have been several traumatic aneurysms of the axillary posterior tibial popliteal and brachial arteries These have been successfully operated on all by the method of Antyllus namely ligation of the artery on the proximal and distal side of the tumour and excision of the sac Colonel Stevenson the author of the wellknown handbook of military surgery Wounds in War operated on a large diffused traumatic aneurysm of the axillary artery in which there was no pulsation whatever The result was most satis factory Several exceptionally interestingcases of perforating pulmo nary wounds have been treated and the results in many of them have been complete recovery This has been largely attributed to the comparatively minute tunnellike wounds in flicted by the Mauser bullet It appears to be agreed that the Mauser bullet inflicts as a rule a much less serious injury than any of the others In a large proportion of instances when a bone is struck instead of being splintered or pulverised it is tunnelled and the opening made being very small soon fills up and the cases as a rule do well The necessity for ampu tation or resection does not therefore arise as often as formerly This opinion is strongly held by the eminent Principal Medical Officer ofthe Field Force SurgeonGeneral Wilson THEI ADMINISTRATION As regards hospital management administration and nursing the arrangements in the Wynberg Hospital are de serving of high commendation With the operating theatre I was most favourably impressed I found everything well up to date The walls sheetea with enamelled zinc the floor tiled and sloping the light abundant both from above and one side and for night operations electric light Ample arrangements for sterilising instruments and dressing have been made and hard by is a room for Roentgen ray photographic work Great credit is due to the military authorities who have brought the arrangements and fittings of this hospital to such a high degree of perfection and I trust that in Natal which is my present destination and where I hope to meet Sir William MacCormac and Mr Treves I may have the good fortune to work in hospitals equally well equipped INVALIDING FROM THE TRANSPORTS FROM OUJR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CAPETOWN February 7th 1900 THE UNDERMANNING OF THE R AMC I AM compelled this week to depart somewhat from the tone of optimism which I have hitherto honestly adopted and to point out one or two directions in which the military machinery is showing some signs of strain These signs have only become evident quite recently and one has no justification for reflecting in any way upon the men on the spot They are working one and all gallantly The material at command is at fault Up to the time of the arrival of the recent reinforcements the Sixth and Seventh Divisions and the auxiliaries the department was standing the strain admirably Now two things are becoming evident one that the personnel of the RAC both officers and men is insuf ficient and without automatic machinery for expansion and the other that the roerves and militia are from a physical point of view somews disappointing INVALID RESERVISTS AND MILITIA One has always held the idea that whatever might be the case with regard to the militia the reservist would be of superior physique to the man with the colours Transport after transport tells us a different tale It is perfectly true that the average reservist is a better developed man than his comrade with the colours but it is unfortunately true tha 536 mm Ban THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR MARCH 3 1900 both reservists and militiamen contain a very large number of lame ducks hopelessly incapable of going to the front This is not the case to any appreciable extent with the colours men who are obviously under such continual observa tion as to render it very unlikely that any obviously unfit men could be drafted for foreign service But the percentage of others who are being landed here and sent to the station hospital with the immediate result of being marked for re drafting to England is far greater than would have been the case had an efficient system of inspection been adopted on your side I am inclined to connect the number of lame ducks with the deficient personnel of the RAMC From the object lessons one is seeing here it is quite evident that the exami tions at home have been conducted either by men who do not understand military requirements or by men who were so pressed for time that they had to run through the work at a speed which does not permit thorough investigation On no other supposition couldone explain the fact that cases of distinct phthisis of renal disease of wellmarked tertiary syphilis of ulcer of leg of large varicose veins of varicocele of inguinal hernia old of chronic gonorrhoea of pretty distinct valvular disease of the heart and similar ailments have been landed here and can only be sent back again and this not in ones and twos but in a very fair proportion The station hospital and un fortunately too often its postmortem room is the index of this state of things THE STATION HOSPITAL AT CAPETOWN The station hospital has today about 350 patients with accommodation in marquees available for another 150 or more that is it is practically a general hospital But a general hospital has a staff calculated for 520 beds The station hospital has a staff for about half that number and owing to the exigencies of the war has gone on expanding and expand ing until the work is fairly beyond the power of the staff The medical officer in charge has no secretary no divisional officers only a small staff of civil surgeons of whom only one has had any military experience and who are moreover being constantly changed He has 37 of the RAMC all told including sergeantmajor and clerks There are in addi tion 24 RAMC belonging to other units but these are con stantly being withdrawn I man from the Militia Medical Staff Corps 23 of the Cape Medical Staff Corps 9 St John men from England and ii others But it must be remem bered that none of these except the RAMC are fully trained and that fatigues are exceptionally heavy mainly owing to the constant transfer of patients from one part to another and to the constant erection and reerection of marquees in the attempt to adjust the accommodation to the exigencies of the patients The number of men on fatigue duty daily has of late been on an average 25 Beside 2 ward masters I9 or 20 special night orderlies are regularly detailed This means three nights in bed for the staff and even then four of the proper wards two detached huts 8o beds two quite detached iron huts 8o beds a marquee camp at a long distance away with go patients and sundry marquees are without any attendant after 5 Pm It is true that every effort is made to put the more serious cases into the better attended wards but carry that as far as you may the wards left to themselves at night contain many cases for whom supervision is necessary Discipline of course must go to the wall and even this attenuated staff is being depleted by the transfer of a sergeant and four corporals to the two addi tional companies of the Cape Medical Staff Corps now being raised These are for bearer purposes and the material com ing forward appears to me to be indifferent To add to the difficulty the already overworked orderly officers at the sta tion hospital are charged with the duty of examining num bers of recruits NEED FOR MORE ORDERLIES AND NuRsEs I blame no local authority for all this The Medical Depart ment has no real reserve and the material for replenishing is not forthcoming You can easily make a good light horse trooper out of your average colonial but the same does not hold good on the medical side Weighty as are the objec tions to nurses the weightiest being the difficulty of accom modating them I see no way out of the trouble but falling back upon the colonial nurses Three nursing sisters Miss Thomas of the Army Nursing Service and two volunteers Mrs Bond and Mrs Withycombe have just joined and are working in the enteric and pneumonia wards THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER XV THE TURN OF THE TIDE THE good news of the surrender of the army which had invested Kimberley for so long has been quickly followed by the official announcement that a portion of the relief force has entered Ladysmith The relief has been purchased at a heavy cost and it is to be feared that the sufferings of the garrisons have been severe Reports received since the relief of Kimberley show that that town offered a heroic resist ance and that its inhabitants endured much from hunger and disease as well as from the enemy The forces on which Colonel Kekewich had to rely were small and indiffer ently armed for the defence of so large a town and the re sources in food supplies had run extremely low before the siege was raised Thus a correspondent of the Daily Chronicle says that the people tell harrowing stories of their sufferings during the siege rivalling those of Paris The stock of mealies had been consumed the horses were starving and those which died of starvation were seized and devoured by the kaffirs Numbers of women and children lived in the underground workings of the mines and when they came to the surface they were pale and weirdlooking like the inhabitants of a nether world On Friday February x6th many saw the sun for the first timefor weeks This residence underground and in bombproof pits may have avoided heavy losses by the Boer bom bardment but I fear that when all the story is told to the casualties of men during the siege will have to be added a long roll of children These children have not only had their milik supply cut off but have been compelled to put up with an in differentwatersupply Kimberleyunderordinarycircumstances is supplied by water brought in i8 miles by pumping from the Vaal river this supply was long ago cut off and that obtain able from the mines could not be entirely trustworthy Siege soup which appears to have consisted of what available vege tables there were with a certain amount of horseflesh may have sufficed for adults but among children it is hardly to be wondered at that many died for want of more suitable nourishment Apart from the privations which all alike had to suffer several women and children are reported killed and wounded during the bombardment BRITISH AND BOER AMBULANCES Reuters agent at Arundel reporting the other day says there is a marked difference between the character of our ambulance waggons and those of the Boers Ours appear designed to combine the greatest clumsiness and the least comfort with the minimum of accommodation It takes ten mules to draw them and they carry 2 men lying down and several sitting they jolt like a quarrymans dray The Boer ambulances on the other hand are lightly but strongly built and provide comfortable accommodation for 8 men lying down they are mounted on springs and scarcely jolt at all If this report be true it is certainly not altogether creditable to us It must however be pointed out that there is among colonists and also among the Boers a predilection in favour of the spiderbuilt American vehicle which has not yet extended itself to Britishers either military or civil In discussing field ambulances in a former letter I suggested that the ideal light ambulance was an American spider and the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL produced an illustration showing the sort of vehicle indicated The extension of this style of mounting on wheels to our larger ambulance waggons would undoubt edly be advantageous I have travelled for days in light American spiderbuilt waggonettes drawn by mules over the rough veld roads and it is astonishing how light strong and at the same time comfortable these spiderbuilt vehicles are The English cart waggon or carriage is invariably built on much heavier lines than the same vehicle would be in America and this gives a certain clumsiness which is not felt over macadamised roads but causes discomfort to the The

Special Correspondent in Capetown November 22nd 1809 THE RED CROSS COLONEL YOUNG the Red Cross Commissioner who arrived last week is rapidly getting voluntary efforts into something like working order His arrival was opportune as there was a danger of the wellmeant enthusiasm of the people leading to much wasteful overlapping His organising ability coupled as it is with a suave and conciliatory manner is likely to effect much Several suburban organisations forthe provision of comforts for the wounded have already amalgamated with the Good Hope Society which was formed not onJy for the pro vision of such comforts but to assist the wives and families of reservists and local volunteers Colonel Young addressed a full meeting of that Society and it was gratifying to find that the Committee agreed to work entirely under his direction Similarly on Monday last lie met the Committee of the Cape town Centre of the St John Ambulance Association and that body passed unanimously a resolution placing itself unre servedly under his orders The Colonial Secretary has placed at Colonel Youngs disposal an office in the Parliament Build ings So far he tells me he is doing practically nothing but collect information and get into touch with the various organi sations as no need has arisen for any special efforts He ex presses himself as particularly pleased with the rest stations organised by the St John Centre at Wynberg Station and the Docks to which I alluded last week TiiE ST JOIIN ANIBULANCE TRAIN The St John detachment for train work has left for De Aar with one of the trains It consists of seven men who have had several weeks training first at railway stretcher work and recently as orderlies at the Station Hospital Capetown Two officers one noncommissioned officer and three men of the RAMC also form part of the train crew Plenty of other St John men are available for similar work if required Colonel Young has provided the train with an ice chest THE MILITARY HOSPITALS The Good Hope Society has already supplied a large amount of fruit literature and the like to the Wynberg General Hospital and contributions are coming in freely It has been decided to establish No 2 General Hospital at Wynberg on a site adjoining No I No 2 will be entirely under canvas Colonel Duke is in command The location of General Hospitals 3 and 4 have not yet been decided upon but neither will be at Durban The Principal Medical Officer has declined the offer of the Stellenbosch people of a supplementary hospital at that place owing to sufficient accommodation being already avail able Sir William MacCormac arrived by the last mail and is at present staying in Capetown as the guest of a local medical friend He has visited No i General Hospital and expressed himself as highly satisfied with everything there MEDICAL REFUGEES Drs Rogers and Keenan lately of Johannesburg have been appointed to the South African Light Horse an irregular corps raised here by the Uitlander Committee Dr Milne another refugee not being able to get a medical appointment has joined the same corps as a combatant The refugee medical men are complaining bitterly about the action of the authorities in engaging civilian aid at home considering that being out of employment and unable to obtain any temporary work in a colony so medically overstocked as the Cape they should have had a chance One Johannesburg medical refugee Dr Harding has been placed on the civilian staff at Wynberg but he obtained his appointment from home THE BOER PRISONERS AT CAPETOWN The more severe cases amongst the Boer prisoners who arrived by the Patiala are at No I General HosDital The slighterones are in an annexe to the Capetown Convict Station with their unwounded felEows It was decided at the last moment to send these there instead of to the Penelope The cases at the Convict Station are under the care of Dr C C Elliot surgeon to that institution BOER AMBULANCE ARRANGEMENTS I have just had an opportunity of speaking with a bearer of the Transvaal Ambulance Corps who has come down with Boer wounded From his account the arrangements made were of the most primitive character He left Johannesburg with an ambulance organised by the St John Centre It consisted of 3 medical men and io dressers 4 of whom were left behind at what may call the  Stationary Hospital  at Newcastle Their only equipment was I waggon fitted to hold 3 men 2 bell tents and a stock of drugs The drugs however were not supplied at Johannessburg but were com mandeered on the way They were simply packed anyway in boxes carried on an ordinary South African waggon Each medical man had a fairly good case of instruments and each dresser one of the St John bearer cases There were 12 stretchers but Ino bearers were provided It would appear that any convenient building at Elandslaagte a coolie store vas selected as what one might call a fieldl hospital One doctor with some of the dressers went on the field the other 2 remained at the field hospital The dressers attended to the wounded on the field and then got Kaflir men to carry them on the stretchers to the building There temporary measures were taken and all serious cases were sent on to Newcastle by train so far as that served and by ordinary waggon otherwise At Newcastle a large house had been commandeered as a hospital and had two doctors and five nr es Not much however was done even there the practice being to send everybody capable of travelling to Johannesburg Each com mando had an ambulance party equipped much after the style above described Iodoform and carbolic oil on lint and gauze were used for first dressings In supreme charge of all medical arrangements is Captain Bleksley who was Sanitary In spector at Johannesburg and head of the St John Centre there To him the surgeons were responsible They appear to have possessed no authority whatever By far the larger proportion of injuries were inflicted by shells Some were very severe At Elandslaagte absolutely every wounded Boer was left to be treated by the British indeed my informant who is a burgher of the State tells me that with the really bad cases this was done as far as possible everywhere There was a great deal of dysentery amongst the Boers but very little other trouble Food supplies were scaree and of what might be called medical comforts hardly anything was to be obtained All through for supplies reliance was placed upon things com mandeered en route THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER IV PROPORTION OF KILLED TO WOUNDED IN the battle at Graspan or as it is to be called Enslin the losses which fell principally upon the Naval Brigade were 24 killed i66 wounded and 7 missing Here we have again to note the happily small proportion of those actually killed among the number hit The Boer force encountered at Gras pan probably consisted of the remnants of the Belmont force together with other fresh commandoes and the rifle employed in all probability was principally the Mauser At the first engagement at the Modder River where Lord Methuens force found 8ooo Boers posted in exceptionally strong posi tions the casualties although severe 73 killed and 365 wounded were lighter than had at first been anticipated This brings the total casualties for the three actions up to 966 killed wounded and missinDg Killed Wounded Missing Belmont   54  238  2 Graspan   24  I66 7 Modder River   72  396  7 150  800 i6 This gives a proportion of killed to wounded approximately as I to 53 The proportion of killed to wounded varies ia 1698 TM 11 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA DEa i6 15g different campaigns and of course depends to a considerable extent on the conditions under which actions are fought the tactics employed by the commanders and the distance usually maintained between the opposing forces and finally whether or not the engagements in a campaign consist for the most part in attacking entrenched positions where one side is exposed at short ranges Colonel Stevenson RAMC Principal Medical Officer on the Line of Communication in his work entitled Wounds in War gives some interestingf statistics on this point Thus in the RussoTurkish war 187778 where entrenched positions were continually attacked at short ranges the proportion of killed to wounded among the Russians was as high as I to 21 at Blenheim in I704 it was I to I3 The late Sir Thomas Longmore summing up the available statistics on this point showed that the proportion of killed to wounded has been on an average I to 4 These figures refer to the number of dead found on the field while of those who reach the hospital alive a large proportion died during the first two or three days but these were not included in the figures given above During the RussoTurkish war 1877 781 ii8 per cent of the wounded died in the army of the Danube and 30 per cent in the army of the Caucasus We may therefore conclude that we shall not be giving a too sanguine estimate when we predict that at least 87 per cent of our wounded in South Africa will eventually recover Fischer whose statistics are probably the most accurate on this subject gives the proportion of killed to wounded as follows At the battle of Kunnersdorf I79   I to 19 At the battle of Leipzig i813    I 20 English in the Crimca     I 44 French in the Crimiea     I  48 Prussiaiis in SchtleswigHolstein i864   I I Prussians at Kiniggratz     I  36 Austrians at Kdniiiggratz     30 Germans in 187071      I 54 Russians in 187778     I 21 Thlis gives an average of I to 32 It will thus be recognised at once that the proportion of I to 53 which is that for the battles on Lord Methuens march is considerably below the average of past campaigns and is curiously enough almost identical with the loss sustained by the Germans in the cam paign of 187071 It must further be borne in mind that these battles have all been fought under exceptionally arduous conditions for our men inasmuch as they have in every instance been storming strongly held and partially entrenched positions Nature of Wounds Your special correspondent in Capetown is able in a recent letter to give some account of the wounds sustained by our men Speaking of the cases which he had seen in the Wyn berg Hospital he says that all are Mauser bullet wounds except two he also says that all the men agree as to the very small amount of shock produced by the Mauser bullets and the slight amount of actual pain at the time of being hit he also says that one notable circumstance is that the majority of the wounds are in the extremities and from another source we hear that they are principally in the legs and abdomen This the men themselves attribute to the wild firing of the Boers As a matter of fact it is an old tradition with the rifle to fire at a mans feet as the bullet fired la little low will ricochet and do great damage while if it be fired too high it passes harmlessly into space There was a tendency with the MartiniHenry and still more with the old Snider for bullets to rise above the point fired at hence the additional incentive to fire at the enemys feet The LeeMetford and Mauser rifles are more accurate than the MartiniHenry and this probably accounts for the fact of so many wounds being inflicted in the lower extremities The bullets actually struck the object on the point aimed at ft is gratifying to think that not only are Mauser bullet wounds frequently almost painless at the time of infliction but that a large number of them heal rapidly by first inten tion a course which was rarely followed by the wounds from bullets of larger calibre LEEMETFORD V MAUSER The bullet which our troops are using in the LeeMetford rifl s is known as the Mark II It is a far less formidable bullet than either the Mark IV or the Dumdum but never theless has a slightly greater smashing power than the Mauser bullet What the proportion of killed to wounded among the Boers may be we are from the figures supplied unable to estimate I commented in my last letter on the extreme importance in the campaign of keeping the railway open and it is extremely gratijying to note that Lord Methuen in his rapid march has done this most effectually with the Kimberley line When the Modder River bridge is once negotiated there will be little difficulty in completing the restoration of the line up to Kimberley The value of the railway for transport purposes as well as for dealing with the sick and wounded is incalculable It is pretty evident that the repairs to the permanent way on the ordinary veld are very readily effected I have had some experience of what may be done in a few hours in this way in South Africa On one occasion the train in which I was travelling having run into a cow was disrailed the engine was thrown on its side and the metals torn up In the course of five hours a new track had been laid passing round the scenie of the catastrophe a fresh engine had arrived on the srene and the whole train with the exception of the capsized enginie proceeded on its way Navvies with spare rails and sleepers may be readily conveyed to the scene of damage and repairs in this way be very rapidly effected MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ARMY IN SOUTH AFRICA In view of the large number of men now with the army in South Africa the Army Medical Department have consider ately published for the information of the public details of their medical arrangements The whole or part of this docu nient has already been published in many daily papers It informs us that every regiment battalion artillery division and engineer company has a medical officer attached to it and he accompanies it into action witLh his orderly in order to administer first aid to any man who is wounded while the regimental stretcher bearers are ready to carry the same to the dressing station or field hospital There will be 45 sur geons in immediate charge of the men composing the Army Corps They are also responsible for the sanitation of their respective camps There is a bearer comparny for each brigade of cavalry and infantry this is composed of 3 officers the officer in charge being a major a sergeantmajor I2 sergeants and corporals 44 privates and a bugler all of the RAMC in addition to which there are for transport 38 men of the Army Service Corps under a warrant officer The mode of working is described as follows Two stretcher sections under an officer each section consisting of four stretcher squads under a sergeant collect the wounded and carry them to the collecting station a spot chosen as near the fighting line as possible but sheltered fromn the enemys fire The collecting station is in clharge of a sergeant who lhas a supply of dressiDgs etc to replenish the haversacks of the stretcher bearers Here also are placed the ambulance of the first Iiine ready to receive them under tlie sergeanits direction and bear tlhern back to the dressing station The dressing station is on a site selected as being if possible out of fire near a water supply and also near a road When available buildings are chosen and if not the operating tent is here piteled and instruments medicines and miiedical comforts are arranged ready for use and a fire liglhtei for heating water It may be considered the most important position in the journjey of a wounded man fronii tlle field towards the camp as it is lhere tle first opportunity occurs for a careful examination of his conditioni The major of the company and another medical officer are here placed with a separate sergeant major three noncommissioned officers and four privates including a cook The wounded being carefully attended to and dressed are now placed in the second linle of ambulance and taken to one of the field hospitals which are encampiments attached to each brigade or each body of troops large enouglh to render it desirable The equipment of a field lhospital is for roo beds but it is so arranged and packed that sections of 25 beds can be utilised separately if required As it inust accompany its brigade on the march it is movable being supplied with means of trans port but it is equipped with a view to make it as comfortable and com plete as its mobility will permit of From the railway line the sick and wounded are conveyed to the base which is at or near one of the ports of embarkation HORSE SICKNESS Since my last letter an interesting description of the South African horse sickness has been published by Professor Wallace in the Times He has been at some pains to collect the latest bacteriological evidence with reference to this disease and says that Numerous experiments by the Director of the Bacteriological Institute at Grahamstown have showed that no material can be obtained from the bodies of animals which have died of the malady which could be used in producing immunity in healthy animals The use of serum from animals which have recovered from the disease has already proved abortive A I Cmpterendu du Service de Sand Militaire

and with an attenuated virus got by transmission of a virulent virus fromn partially imijmunje animals By this means a mild form of the disease is produced a period of at least fifty days is allowed to elapse during which secondary attacks of fever and moderately higl temperatures occur at frequent intevals By repeated mild attacks the system is fortified againist suibsequeut inoculation more effectively than by an attack accompanied by high temperature The secondary fever which occurs to a horse after recovery fronm a natural attack is termed by the Dutch  Anmanning and until thie first of these returns have passed off the animal is not fully protected or  salted Inoculation in any form is consequently out of the question in connection with the preserva tion of the animals engaged in the present campaign Under these circumstances we may still conclude that the best practical remedy available for our troops is that recom mended by me in my last letter namely the provision of nosebags to act as air filters through which the animals breathe and they should be worn from sunset until the dew is well off the grass on the following morning Horse sick ness cedema mycosis according to Professor Wallace is a fever produced by a microorganism one of the filamentous fungi which under suitable conditions of heat and moisture grows in the veld but whether in the water on the soil or as aisa parasite is not yet known THE GENEVA CONVENTION THE GENEVA CONVENTION OF I864 ONE of the redeeming features of modern warfare is the pro tection which is afforded to ambulances and military hos pitals and their personnel The Geneva Convention of I864 which was signed by most of the Powers of Europe and has since been recognised by nearly every civilised State has done much to alleviate the horrors of a campaign and the sufferings of the wounded on either side The strict neutral ity of the ambulance and the protection which it affords both to friend and foe are the most important results of the Geneva Convention of 1864 wiile in i868 certain additional Articles also signed by the representatives of many Euro pean nations provided itzter alia for the care and protection of hospital ships The Geneva Convention was signpd on behalf of Switzer qand Baden Belgium Denmark Spain France Hesse Darm stadt Italy Netherlandls

year on behalf of Great Britain Austria Barlen Baaria Belgium Denmark France Italy Netherlands No th G4ermany Sweden and Norway Switzerland Turkey and Wurtemberg ART 1The persons designated in Art

The wounded and wrecked picked up by these ships cannot be reclaimed by either of the combatants and they will be required not to serve during the continuance of the war SOLDIERS WILLS There is one branch of our own law that namely which relates to the making of the wills of soldiers on active service to which it may be useful to make brief reference By Section XI of the Wills Act 1837 it was provided That any soldier being in actual military service or any mariner or seaman being at sea may dispose of his personal estate as he might have done before the making of that Act Before the passing of that Act a soldiers will was regulated by the common law that is it might have been made by an unattested document or by word of mouth By reason of the above Section the same rule holds good at the present day It has been decided that the term  soldier in Section XI of the Wills Act includes an officer and a surgeon Drummond v Parish 3 Curt 522 The words on actual military service are equivalent to  on an expedition but an officer or surgeon while quartered at home or abroad in barracks is not on actual military service Drummond v Parish 3 Curt 522 Although there need be no attestation clause it is necessary that some formality sbould be gone through in order to obtain probate Thus when a will made by an officer on actual military service is signed by him but not attested the Court will require an affidavit by two disinterested persons that the signature is in his handwriting re Neville 4 S and T 218 And where the will is signed by the mark of the deceased an affidavit must be filed to show that when he made the mark the testator had knowledge of the contents of the will re Hackett 28 L J P 42 TRANSFERS AND APPOINTMENTS THIE 4th Field

17 igoo1 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA AH5 449 which our brigade was now a part marched from Balmoral 17 miles distant but we were not destined to reach there without mishap The weather had been very threatening all day and rain began about 2 pm  about 3 miles on the wrong side of Balmoral our own convoy was brought to the halt at a drift in which a Cape cart and a 47 gun had stuck  the former was however the offender so far as our further pro gress was concerned By this time it was pitch dark the rain was coming down in a pitiless torrent and the wind was icy cold To proceed was impossible and we had to stay here the night three miles of convoy in our rear being in the same plightno food no shelter Major Hale with character istic energy walked on to Balmoral to report and on coming back wet through he and I made the best of it in a Cape cart which I had fortunately commandeered at Rustfontein To describe this night is beyond my powers but when I say that we alone lost 12 mules and that I counted 195 dead ani mals within quite a short distance some idea may be formed of its severity Early in the morning we made ready to pro ceed when we heard that an officer of the Argyll and Suther land Highlanders had died in the night from exposure we sent back a stretcher party and carried the body in with us to be buried by the regiment We reached Balmoral at 1030 and looked forward toa days rest but were doomed to disappointment as orders came at 11 pm for us to march at 1230 back to Pretoria Return to Pretoria Many guesses were made as to the reason for the return of the division and we thought we were being done out of the final advance to Komati Poort and neighbouring district  but events proved that this was yet far distant important work having to be done in the Rustenburg distrist before the final advance could be undertaken Our return march was uneventful We reached Pretoria on July 30th and the division marched past Lord Roberts and a large crowd of people at 12 oclock on its way to campt Daaspoort two miles to the west of the town We sent all our sick chiefly cases of fever and intestinal trouble to the detachment that I found had been installed by the principal medical officer in a house which they were energetically preparing as a military hos pital and was taken over by the RAMC our officers and men being lent for use until we should require their services in the field Unfortunately our mules had been handed back to the transport and hence we could not obtain fresh ani mals This day in Pretoria was a very busy one as w were under orders to march the next morning The March to Rustenburg On August ist Mahons brigade marched through Vander boom Pass and then westwards on the Rustenburg road Pilcher was on our right and the rest of Hamiltons division on the left separated from us by the range of hills At 8 am fighting began and continued all day our guns dislodging the Boers from a kopje at Middlewater where we camped for the night Two of our ambulances went out after the fighting and brought back five wounded all flesh wounds of the thighs or buttocks made as the men were lying down We finished dressing these cases by 10 pm and sent one of our ambulance waggons with the wounded back to Pretoria the next morning The next day we marched forwards heavy firing proceeding all day from Hamiltons direction but Mahons brigade did not come into action In the evening we camped at Zilikatz Nek where the Lincolns had been attacked some time before The fighting on this day had been with a commando holding this pass and Hamilton had about forty casualties which were dealt with by his own field hospitals The country we were now in is very pretty certainly the garden of the Transvaal  the valley bounded by considerable hills on either side is very fertile and studded by prosperous farms in many cases well stocked Oranges lemons and similar fruits grow in abundance and proved most acceptable The want of fresh vegetables and fruit is very severely felt after a time and these are eagerly taken when a chance offers On August 3rd our march was very short as we had to cross the Crocodile River by a bad drift We camped just the other side of it opposite Commando Pass but saw nothing of the enemy although about twenty prisoners were brought in from neighbouriug farms The next day we marched to Sterk THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA THE IMPERIAL YEOMANRY FIELD HOSPITAL We have received the following further letter from Mr C Stonham Chief Surgeon and Officer Commanding Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital  Senior Surgeon Westminster Hospital etc  At Pretoria The Devils Kantoor October 6th In my letter from Barberton I gave a short outline of our marches and work up to our return to Pretoria from Springs on July 17th We entered Pretoria early in the morning and sending our convoy to our old camping ground at Arcadia Major Hill and I went to report to the Principal Medical Officer and obtain further orders it was decided that we should have a detachment of the Field Hospital and Bearer Company with some of our trans port animals and waggons at Pretoria while the main body marched to rejoin General Mahons brigade We accordingly left Mr Openshaw and Dr Purves Stewart with 50 men 5 waggons and the necessary equipment and stores for the formation of a rest camp hospital Next morning we marched with the remainder and came up with General Mahon in the afternoon at KameeFs Drift There had been two days fighting here and we did not leave the ridge until July 20th on which day we passed Pretoriuss farm and spent nearly all day in crossing the Pienaars River  the drift was very steep and hence the waggons and especially the heavy guns required many teams to drag them over  South African Drifts These drifts are passages of the usually rocky beds of rivers with at this season of the year comparatively little water During the rains there may be as much as 40 feet to 50 feet of water at the drifts which are consequently rendered impassable Many drifts have very steep banks and abomin able approaches which when a few waggons have passed are often a foot deep in mud and slush In this carts sometimes stick and it becomes necessary to employ double or even treble spans of mules or oxen to pull them out I need hardly say that the passage of such drifts by ambulance waggons causes very considerable suffering to sick and wounded men and delay to the whole convoy which may extend for many miles On some days we have had to pass as many as halfa dozen drifts our march being consequently slow and most arduous not to mention the wear and tear to transport animals Ambulance Waggons Drifts are a very severe test of the strength and durability of a waggon In this respect we certainly have much reason to thank the builder of ours  they are most excellent have stood wear and tear admirably and I think I may say are the best in the country Our ambulance waggons are built dif ferently to those in use in the army which only carry two patients lying down whereas ours will take four and are much lighter The March to Balmoral On July 2ist at 830 there was heavy firing about 10 miles ahead of us and it continued at intervals all day until we reached our camp where we found that the Boers had been shelling Colonel Hickmans force near a spruit Colonel Hickman with 800 men were camped here and the next day he transferred our sick to his field hospital which was going back to Pretoria On July 22nd Mahons brigade joined Ian Hamiltons division at Rustfontein where we remained the next day to give PoleCarew and Clery time to march up on our right flank Just before reaching camp at dusk one of our waggons I regret to say came to grief in a hole the native driver being killed and the waggon orderly receiving two very severe scalp wounds On July 24th we camped at Bronkhorst Spruit the enemy sniping our rear during the march here We found a large forceabout 20000Lords Robert and Kitchener having come up in the morning The next day Hamiltons division of I45Q mwSSitMETEOPOLITAN BOROUGH COUNOIISNov 17 1900 stroom and a runner came in from Baden Powell who was hemmed in at Rustenburg bringing a map made by him and indicating the various positions occupied by the Boers and their numbers When we advanced on August 5th however they were not to be found and we reached Rustenburg unopposed The Actions about Rustenburg The country is naturally fortified on this side of Pretoria and if the Boers do not defend it it argues most strongly that they will not again stand On August 6th Major Hale and I marched out with part of our ambulances towards Majata Pass where the enemy was said to be in force but we returned at night without having seen anything of them although heavy gun fire was heard all day some miles distant and it was feared the Boers had captured one of our convoys coming up from Mafeking The next day we marched back a we thought for Pretoria having relieved Rustenburg and Baden Powell marching with us We carried in our waggons all the sick and wounded who were fit to leave the Rustenburg Hospital and supplied the doctor in charge of those who could not be moved with medical comforts from our own stores On August 9th we passed over Commando Pass and camped at Grootplatz from which place we sent a sick convoy to Pretoria On the nth we again proceeded westwards passing through Hekpoort the next day and camping at Thorndale On August 13th Major Hale and Dr Green with two ambulance waggons went on with a flying column under General Watson the rest of us following with the remainder of the division We came in touch with Kitchener and Methuen on August 15th who were pursuing a commando under C de Wet who was making for Rustenburg to join Delarey Mahons column came back to our camp on this day On August 17th having camped the night before 5 miles to the westward we moved on to Olifants Nek half a battery and some infantry going on ahead with four of our ambulances under Major Hale After some shelling the Boers were driven from the Nek and we proceeded to Rustenburg From this action we had only two wounded The next morning we again left Rustenburg and marched towards the Crocodile River near which at Zwartkopps Mahons brigade had a two days action August 19th and 20th with De Wets commando On the first day one of our waggons was taken together with an Australian ambulance by the Boers but Major Hale rode back and represented the facts to the General who at once sent a doctor from one of the Boer ambulances which was in our lines and which we had helped with drugs and medical comforts to interview the Boer commandant with the result that the ambulance came in later in the afternoon and brought in some wounded On the night of August 20th the Boers vacated their posi tion and we went in pursuit as far as Warm Baths but we failed to come up with them August 24th On August 26th we left for Pretoria where we arrived on August 28th to leave again however after one days rest for our march to Barberton THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH COUNCILS The following is we believe a complete list of the

disastrous battle of Colenso on December isth 1899 the field hospital to which I was attached returned to Frere Camp Sir Redvers Buller also returned to Frere and made that place once more his headquarters I have remained at Frere under canvas ever since The hospital was pitched in the same place and was cleared of all the wounded We soon became filled up with cases of dysentery and enteric fever The dysentery was of a severe type and we had several deaths One of my nurses Miss Tarr was I am sorry to say taken ill with dysentery and was at once removed to Maritzburg She developed the affection in a very acute form and at one time her life was despaired of She is now I hear doing well but will of course not be able to go to the front again TREATMENT OF DYSENTERY I might mention that the treatment of dysentery which is mostly followed at Maritzburgwhere there are now many casesis that by sulphate of magnesia The treatment is somewhat painful but such able practi xioners as Dr Scott of Maritzburg and Dr Brown of the Assembly Hospital are convinced of its great efficiency Another method of treatment in favour with many is that by perchloride of mercury with a little opium I have had an opportunity of seeing many cases of dysentery and my impression is that of the methods of treatment at present in vogue that by purgativessuch as sulphate of magnesiais the best Dr Brown under whose kind and skilful care my nurse was has quite con vinced himself of the value of the sulphate of magnesia mode of cure THE WOUNDED AT MARITZBURG ihring my stay at Frere I paid two visits to Marifzburg Ao see certain of the wounded One of these visits was in xesponse to a telegram from the War Office requesting me so see and report upon two wounded officers The cases from Colenso still lying at Maritzburgwere doing well and one was over and over again struck by the marvellous anatomical feats performed by the Mauser bullet Per haps the most remarkable cases are those in which a bullet has passed through the brain without causing more than trifling symptoms TRAUMATIC ANEURYSM The number of instances of traumatic aneurysm is also curious I have seen traumatic aneurysms of the brachial femoral popliteal and posterior tibial several varicose aneurysms of the thigb and an aneurysmal varix in Scarpas triangle ARTERIOVENOUS ANEURYSMS In one case there was a very large arteriovenous neurysm in Hunters canal with free communication with the vein and great swelling of the thigh The lesion was due to a Mauser bullet which had escaped At the invitation of the surgeon in charge I operated upon this case I placed a temporary ligature on the com mon femoral opened the sac dipcovered the holes in the artery and vein and ligatured the artery above and helow the wound and the vein on the proximal side only Before the incision was closed the temporary ligature was removed This case I am glad to say did well and when I saw the man again fourteen days after the operation he was well on the road to complete recovery THE HOSPITAL ARRANGEMENTS On Friday January 12th Sir Redvers Buller left Frere and on the following day the 13th we took our departure The movement was to be to Springfield some i8 miles from Frere In order to meet the demands of the position and the possibilities of a big battle on or near the Tugela Colonel Gallwey CB the Principal Medical Officer de cided to make No 4 Stationary Field Hospital to which I had been attached from the first a mobile hospital to follow the troops otherwise all the wounded would have to be carried back to Frere Colonel Gallwey also esta blished a general hospital at Mooi River with 5oo beds and these with the iioo beds available at Maritzburg and the few beds at Estcourt would do much to meet a very difficult medical position There can be no doubt that Colonel Gallweys arrangements were ably conceived and admirably carried out He certainly spared no trouble to make the Army Medical Department in Natal a complete success THE JOURNEY OF THE HOSPITAI Oar march was made on January 13th and an account of it will give some idea of the difficulties in the way of work at the front The hospital is to accommodate a minimum of 300 beds and was made up of 6o tents and I0 marquees The rank and file of the RAMC numbered 88 There were I 2 surgeons including myself 2 army sisters and my remaining nurse Miss McCaul We also took with us ioo coolies for camp work who walked all the way with their earthly possessions on their heads Our train was composed of i6 ox waggons each with i6 oxen The water and bread carts were also drawn by oxen so that the number of oxen employed was over 260 There were 5 ambulances each drawn by IO mules My own transport consisted of a small covered waggon a Scotch cart i6S mules a conductor on horseback 4 Kafflr  boys a groom and my manservant There were there fore 66 mules on the road I rode on horseback as did most of the other surgeons We got up at 3 AM the tents were all down by 4 AM and at 515 AM we left Frere It was a glorious day a little too hot for comfort and with a too blazing sun We outspanned for two hours at 730 AM and reached Springfield at 230 PM having done the whole march in two treks Considering the roads the size of the waggons the slowness of oxen and the heat this was con sidered a good march On nearing Springfield we had an escort and passed 4 Boer prisoners being marched to the base A VIEW OF THE BATTLEFIELD The camp at Springfield was a very charming one and the Lesser Tugela which is swift but muddy provided excellent bathing I rode each day to the hill command iog the Great Tugela upon which our big guns are placed The view from this hill is grand in the extreme It com manis a splendid plain covered with kopjes across which runs the Ladysmith road At the bottom of the hill which was rendered beautiful by mimosa trees in bloom was the drift The Boer trenches were well in view and until our guns began I could see the Boers working in their shirtsleeves at their allpervading earthworks On Thursdiy January i8th the hospital moved to the banks of the Great Tugela a distance of six miles I had an opportunity of seeing from the hill on which our guns were placed the many details connected with the crossing of the river the passing of our men across the drift and their hiding behind the nearest kopje the play of the howitzers and the field artillery the ascent of the balloon and the hundred and one incidents which attend a great military movement One could also watch Sir Charles Warrens advance on the left Over and ovEr again our shells burst right in the Boer trenches but only very rarely could any Boers be seen They FEB 24 900 SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALS r liryvtr 4 7 lay low with admirable patience I cannot imagine that the area of a great battlefield could be better viewed than from the hill on which we stood and which rose abruptly from the river bank The quietness of the place when the guns ceased was extreme and was broken only by the numerous doves which occupy the wood on the hill side The country although occupied by some thousands of Boers appeared to be absolutely deserted There was a suspiciously large number of Boer ambulances to be seen and I imagine that not a few of these ambulances were carrying ammunition and supplies The accuracy of our big gun firing was much to be ad mired and there was hardly a trench donga or copse which had not a shell dropped into it at some time I be lieve that some five miles of the Ladysmith road is in view from the hill The soldiers have been lying out without tents and on short rations but fortunately the weather has been fine It is difficult to give a proper impresaion of the immense tract of country to be covered and of the number and irregularity of the hills which have to be passed THE PROVISIONING OF THE FORCE The transport of rations fodder and ammunition for the large force employed must tax the Army Service Corps to the utmost but so far the difficulty has been well met Miles of waggons are to be met with along the road and many thousands of oxen are employed I shall hope to be able to give some account of the engagement which is impending At present we are wait ing ready to start at an hours notice and of the direction of our move we know nothing SURGICAL NOTES FROMI THE MILITARY HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA BULLET INJURIES OF THE HEAD A HUMANE WAR THE remark has already been frequently made that this is a very humane war It is to be hoped that such is really the ease As far as regards bullet wounds there is no doubt that the vast majority inflict as a rule little pain either at the time that the wound is received or subsequently Flesh wounds heal soundly in a few days The apertures of entrance and exit which are often scarcely to be distinguished from each other close up at once The track of the Mauser or the LeeEnfield bullet cicatrises rapidly into a tough cord most noticeable where muscle has been traversed Large extravasations are quickly absorbed and suppuration scarcely ever occurs A month or so after the injury the scars on the surface are often scarcely perceptible and when they are situated in a fold of the skin particularly about the face as for instance by the eyelids the closest inspection is neces sary to detect any mark at all The explanation of the gratifying absence of all untoward complications probably lies in the fact that in an ordinary wound resulting from a small bore nickelsheathed clean bullet little if any air is intro duced into the wound The wound is almost valvular and little more than is frequently made in subcutaneous surgery If the bullet passes through the ordinary helmet worn by the men it does not bore a hole clean through such as would be made by a drill The aperture will more probably consist of a semicircular cut through the material and the little tongue of material corresponding in diameter with that of the bullet is seen to be slightly depressed below the level of the cleancut portion Much the same sort of effect appears to be produced on the skin and possibly on deeper structures It is not difficult to understand therefore how large wounds that must have tra versed most important viscera heal readily In a subsequent letter I hope to mention cases where the lung or lungs have been perforated the abdominal cavity traversed or the liver shot through with little more than temporary trouble In the abdominal cases it is certainly still a question whether in the absence of positive indications exploratory laparotomy is advisable The opinion generally held now seems to be ad verse to operation But so large and impcrtatt a subject re quires to be dealt with fully and at present there is scarcely material enough to hand to justify any conclusions in the matter With head injuries however the case is different The large number already seen has probably led most of those who have had them under treatment or watched their progress generally to arrive at certain broad conclusions Perhaps no class of cases has shown more satisfactory results and the re coveries in many instances have been very remarkable In detailing some few instances that have come under notice I will confine myself chiefly to the clinical aspect of the cases and allow the records to speak for themselves The points already mentioned with regard to the behaviour of the bullet in traversing the soft parts such as the Ecalp must be borne in mind in considering injuries of the skull and its contents and it must also be remembered that we have no details of head injuries that were immediately fatal  GUTTER WOUNDS OF THE SKULL A considerable number of gutter wounds are seen Here the skull is grazed or troughed to a greater or less depth Even when a strip of scalp is destroyed the wound heals up very readily and when more or less circular apertures of entrance and exit are present the grooving of the bone may easily escape detection But these injuries are by no means unimportant Even when the skull is lightly touched there is likely to be very considerable fracture and splintering of the internal table When such cases have been trephined owing to cerebral symptoms the extent of underlying damage has usually excited astonishment There is little doubt in my mindand I believe the opinion will come to be shared by the surgeons at work in the military hospitalsthat every case of gutter woundof the skull should be trephined In head injuries it is necessary to look far ahead To con centrate the attention on the mere healing of the wound is to miss the cardinal importance of these cases Operation in tbese instances though it may seem unnecessary and though it must be in some degree exploratory is really most strongly indicated as a preventive measure We are all in civil hos pitals at home only too familiar with cases of old head injury in which mental symptoms have gradually developed and we would probably acknowledge if only to ourselves that belated surgical interference in such patients does not give very encouraging results Exploratory laparotomies are perpetually being performed in civil life often with very faint shadow of justification Exploratory trephinings are too often omitted simply because the symptoms which might indicate operation only slowly come on It is very far from my intention to criticise now in any way surgical practice here Operations for trephining here in this campaign have been so strikingly successful as I make no doubt whatever statistics will hereafter show that the surgeons show no reluctance to undertake them Nevertheless some gutter wounds are seen which have been left to themselves It is of course a class of injury very rarely met with in civil prac tice Possibly some of those wounded in this way have been sent back to the front as recovered It will be interertng in this case to note whether the men are easily affected by the sun for it must be a matter of common experience that for a long time after a head injury involving any damage to the encepbalon patients are peculiarly liable to ke so affected even in climates much more temperate than that of South Africa Possibly the high velocity of modern bullets ac counts for the damage to the internal tables of the skull The vibrations set up through the thickness of the skull by the passage of a MauEer bullet say partly through the ex ternal table must be enormously rapid and the mechanical explanation of the bone lesion is not far to seek PENETRATING WOUNDS OF THE HEAD Bullet wounds actually penetrating the skull and some portion of its contents are numerous enough and constitute at first sight the most remarkable cases met with in the military hospitals First with regard to the effects on the skull itself The range will as is well known and as has been determined experimentally greatly influence the amount of injury inflicted on the bone Unfortunately reliable informa tion can very seldom be obtained on this point All who have 472 KmIS JmALj SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALS FEB 24 1900 read the accounts of the engagements near the Modder River and at Colenso will recognise that the men can have had but a vague idea of the range at which they were hit At Colenso for instance scarcely a Boer was seen and there were tiers upon tiers of entrenched positions Usually the shortness of the range is much exaggerated 250 yards is a common estimate There is no doubt however that the Highland Brigade at Magersfontein were shot down at extremely close quarters Judging by the results of the experiments made with modern smallbore rifles in England and Germany the bulk of the head injuries seen in hospital have been inflicted at medium ranges say 400 to 8oo yards This is really what we should expect for at close quarters the amount of damage caused by a penetrating wound of the head is so extensive as to be probably fatal The more obliquelythe bullet enters the skull the greaterwill be the amount of damage totheinnertables If the apertures of exit and entrance are both at a right angle to the plane of the skull both wounds may seem to be cleanly drilled through the bone and are scarcely to be distinguished by external inspec tion But in all cases the inner table will be more or less broken up at the aperture of entrance and if the skull is trephined there will be no doubt whatever as to the direction of the wound Even in a long wound fragments of bone may be found lying along the greater part of the track In not a few instances where trephining has been done at the front a second operation has been found necessary at the base and much loose bone removed At very short ranges the skull may be burst open to a greater or less extent in the manner which has been shown experimentally to take place Thus in Colonel Stevensons work on Gzunshot Wounds a skull is figured into which a small bore bullet had been fired at a distance of few yards I have not the work by me for reference but believe the distance was ten yards The skull is seen to be most extensively frac tured The specimen is in the Museum at Netley to the best of my recollection The observations made above relate to the calvarium and instances may now be cited bearing out the foregoing remarks I have to thank the surgeons for permission to give the fol lowing sketches of the cases under their charge Frequently the patients as they are moved from field to base hospital or on to hospital ships have been under the care of several surgeons and it is impossible to communicate with all More over oftentoo often indeedthe patients are shifted about in the base hospitals and it is far from easy to follow out a particular case without giving much trouble to the much over worked administrative staff The followirg are examples of injury at close range Private D wounded at Modder River on December ioth I899 Entrance wound 2 inches behind right parietal eminence in a line drawn between that eminence and occi pital protuberance Exit through frontal bone in right side close to longitudinal sinus The bullet traversed at least 6 inches of brain tissue The left arm was completely and the left leg partially paralysed There was evidence of fracture of the base on both sides Sanious discharge from both ears and deafness The fissure seemed to split the skull in two in the vertical plane A large flap connecting the two bone wounds was turned down and the skull trephined on the inner side of both the exit and entrance wounds Many fragments of bone were removed frdm dura mater and also blood clot and damaged brain matter The scalp wound united at once save over the anterior crown of trephine where it was healing by granulation on December 27th and where there seemed to be some tendency to hernia cerebri The deafness improved rapidly and the discharge from the ears at first abundantsoon ceased On December 27th he could hear well no facial paralysis The leg had recovered power to a very considerable extent but as usually happens the footdrop was almost complete The arm was still completely paralysed His memory and mental condition generally were practically normal Recovery seemed probable Further notes of this case are promised Probably the cortex was not damaged by the fragments of bone but the motor areas of the arm and leg were damaged by the track of the bullet passing close beneath the cortex In another case of wound at undoubted short range the bullet entered close to the longitudinal sinus in the occipital vein possibly even wounding it and passing out through the frontal bone traversing several inches of brain matter The skull was trephined in front of the posterior wound and it was found that a fissure connected the apertures of entrance and exit Fragments of bone were removed and brain matter Free hmorrhage necessitated plugging the wound posteriorly but it was not certain that the haemorrhage came from the longitudinal sinus Forty eight hours later the bleeding recurred on the removal of the plug and it was replaced Thenceforward rapid recovery The wound was received on December 15th and a month later the power had almost entirely returned in the arm and to a great extent in the leg but there was still marked foot drop The mental condition was altogether satisfactory THE HELMET AS A PROTECTION That the helmets worn by the men afford a considerable amount of protection the following cases will show In one of the actions near the Modder River a private pre sented himself with a scalp wound and a fissure of the skull According to his own account the injury caused symptoms of concussion The bullet was found beneath the inner canvas lining of the helmet having perforated the substance but failed to pass right through The canvas bulged in over the site of the head injury and the bullet a Mauser could be distinctly felt and rattled about In another instance a bullet traversed the frontal lobes from side to side and was found embedded in the substance of the helmet fitting firmly into the hole it had made No operation was performed in this case and there were abso lutely no symptoms The entrance and exit wounds were close to the coronal suture Probably in both these cases the wounds were inflicted at long range at say Iooo yards In the second case the possi bility of aftereffects occurring months or even years after the injury is one to be borne in mind The inner table judging by the experience of other cases was almost certainly broken and driven in to the dura mater to some extent As a curi osity may be here mentioned the case of a private In this instance the bullet entered just behind the left mastoid pro cess at the base evidently narrowly escaping the lateral sinus and passing out through the upper lip in the right side The wound healed throughout immediately Some apology is I feel needed for any absence of syste matic classification of the cases mentioned in this letter I have thought it better to content myself with little more than the bare record of the cases giving them more or less in the order in which they chance to have been seen Moreover our experience of the effects of the most modern firearms in actual warfare is still young and possibly large additions may be made to it before long The time will come later on for de liberate conclusions and for systematic analysis At present statistics are merely being collected and the opportunity for working out the results they may show has not arrived A PUZZLING CASE A case brought under my notice when the patient was in the hospital ship Lismore Castle is rather a puzzle The man was wounded at Colenso on December x5th The wounds in the scalp were characteristic of an ordinary Mauser bullet The entrance wound was through the left frontal bone on the level of the eminence and the exit through the parietal at the same level The track was almost exactly parallel to the longitudinal sinus and close to it There was no paralysis of the limbs The sole symptom was loss of vision of the left eye Lightcouldjustbe distinguished The man complained of weakness in the right eye The fundus oculi appeared per fectly normal There seemed to be no doubt that previous to the wound the vision of the left eye was natural No branch of the fifth nerve appeared to have been damaged sensation over the area supplied by the supraorbital nerve was normal as far as could be ascertained The loss of vision occurred immediately on the receipt of the wound The vision of the right eye was improving slowly but from the first was but little impaired No change had taken place in the course of some three weeks in the vision of the left eye Some considered that trephining was indicated in this case not so much in any hope of restor ing or improving vision but more because tolerably extensive injury to the inner table might from the experience of other The War In South AfricaAuthors Clinton T Dent and William ThomsonSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2048 Mar 31 1900 pp

No 4 General Hospital stationed close to the Mooi River sta tion on the Natal Government Railway main line and known generally as the Mooi River Hospital merits a detailed notice for it reflects infinite credit on the R AMC and on all con cerned  on those who selected the site on those who laboured hard to utilise it to the best advantage on those who are entrusted with the management and on the medical staff who work together with an esprit de corps not invariably found in large military base hospitals However stereotyped the pattern each hospitalwhen once it has got into full working swing develops an individuality and this quality undoubt edly affects the standard of the work done No 4 has one great advantage due to its position It is not near any town or even village There are a few camps scattered about in the vicinity The cavalry depot is situated on the left bank of the river a mile away The campa small oneof the scouts is seen in the distance and close to this in a commanding position on the strong crest overlooking a flat wellwatered plain on which a great herd of cattle grazes peacefully a de tachment of the Naval Brigade watch unceasingly for an enemy now mercifully never likely to show themselves again as such in the vicinity Viewed through the clear air the kopjes where the Boer guns were stationed when they helled the station seem but a short distance away A thriving farm nestles under the slope of a hill a mile or two away bedded in a dark patch of trees relieved by the brighter green of the mealie fields around it For the most part the country is quite bare of trees but here and there on the crests of the hills dark fringes show The country is really a great upland over 4 000 feet above the sea level The beauty lies in the magnificent sweeping curves of the hills and possibly to some extent in the fact that the bracing air predisposes one to ad mire everything No better station could have been found for a hospital and indeed the place is known as a health resort A couple of miles away is the Lake Hotel known to invalids situated in the minute village of Weston and looking down the valleytealong which the river winds The Officers Hospital The principal hotel close to the railway station has been taken over entirely and converted into a hospital for officers It is well adapted for the purpose having a large verandah or  stoep running round three sides of the building Most of the officers are accommodated in separate rooms an arrange ment that seems to be preferred though the reason is rather hard to understand These bedrooms are small and most of them of an uncompromising cubical shape that suggests rather a prison cell than a sick room The isolation is complete if the occupant has any complaint that confines him to bed and at Mooi River visitors are few and far between a condition of affairs which may increase the monotony of convalescence in some cases but undeniably tends to the smooth working of the hospital even if it be not an actual advantage to the patients The officers no doubt feel the deprivation of com munication with the outside world but the men in camp un gracious as it may be to hint even at the fact appear to be perfectly satisfied with their own society and profoundly in different as to whether they are visited or not People do not always realise how absorbing and engrossing an occupation is the contemplation of ones own convalescence The main diningroom is fitted up as a general ward with about a dozen beds As in all buildings not primarily de signed for hospitals the ventilation arrangements are less thorough than might be desired So long as the warm weather continues and windows and doors can be kept con tinually open there is nothing to complain of But the winter is fast approaching and the cold at Mooi River can be very severe Some difficulty is likely then to be experienced throughout the building in securing an adequate supply of fresh air without draught and without risk of chill This after all is a problem in hospital construction that is still not solved to everyones satisfaction in places where the architect and the sanitary officer have a free hand to devise the most perfect arrangements that can be secured The sanitary arrangements of the hotel are now good though the amount of work done at the outset in this direction before the sanitary condition was considered satisfactory must have rather surprised the proprietors of the hotel The ground immediately surrounding the hospital required extensive clearing for in this as in so many of the hotels and dwellings in South Africa the immediate entourage was more than untidy Kaffir servants can hardly be expected to realise the necessity of living not only in a clean house but with clean surroundings Sufficient care is not taken to im press this on them They are such intelligent willing and cheerful servants that the fault clearly lies with the masters rather than with the subordinates The alterations sweep ings and cleanings effected by the RAMC before the place was held fit for the reception of patients must have astounded and it is to be hoped also instructed them There is no doubt that the bold step of  commandeering  the hotel has been thoroughly justified In the case of officers tent life in hospital is unsuitable on many grounds For the men however whenever the climate will allow of it tent hospitals appear to be the ideal arrangement on active service Cooking In the important but often rather neglected detail of cook ing the arrangements appear satisfactory This essential department of a hospital has probably during the present campaign occasioned the authorities as much trouble and worry as any other of administration and it must be ad mitted that the difficulty has not always been satisfactorily met Sick cookery is an art that but few possess and in valids are critical to the point of captiousness in many cases Even offers of large salaries have failed to tempt competent chefs and the dearth of cooks of even moderate ability has been a serious trial No Principal Medical Officer can ever feel entirely confident in the smooth working of the hospital under his charge unless this essential detail has been satisfac factorily provided for It is the one department in which everyone is qualified to give an opinion It is unfortunate that in our country the disposition to learn the art of cooking and the talent for exercising that art appears to be confined to women The importance of this subsidiary branch of army organisation does not appear to have received the same amount of consideration in our own country as it has in Conti nental nations The Hospital Camp From the Mooi Eiver station to the hospital camp is about three quarters of a mile the ground on the right bank of the river rising in a gentle slope A thoroughly good road has been made and a wide wellconstructed wooden bridge thrown across the river The discomfort of transit from the station is thus reduced to a minimum and a high embank ment renders the gradient of the road down to the river very gradual so that the wheeled stretcher carriages are easily conveyed to the hospital The Hospital Trains While on the subject of the conveyance of patients from the front it may not be out of place here to make brief reference to the hospital trains on the Natal Govern ment Railway At the time of my visit there were two such trains both of which had been converted for the purpose Although extreme ingenuity had been shown in making the very best of the materials at hand it must be admitted that the trains fell far short of the standard attained in Cape Colony and also it would appear in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State The cardinal difficulty that could not be overcome was that the corridor carriage is not in use on this line and no corridor carriages of course that might have been converted could be brought round from Cape Colony by rail as a glance at a map of the railway system will show Even at a station where there is a suitable platform the entraining of a stretcher case was attended with some inconvenience and even risk to the patient Where no platform existed the difficulty was of course much enhanced It is true that in other of our hospital trains this drawback has not been fully recognised I was informed by Major Daly EAMC whose almost unique Maroh 31 1900JTHE MOOI RIVER GENERAL HOSPITALmS1iBSS5a 773 experience in this war gave him full opportunity of seeing the arrangements made for the care of the sick and wounded on the Boer side that in his opinion the Boer ambulance trains were superior to our own In particular he praised the ingenious arrangement whereby patients could be easily entrained out in the open A sloping way adapted at will to the position of the train could be let down and the stretcher bearers were able without difficulty and without alarming the patient to carry their burden into the carriage The device resembled apparently the method adopted in England for horseboxes These trains were it is alleged bought in Germany a striking example if true of the completeness of the preparations thought necessary for purely defensive purposes The worst feature of the separate compartment arrangement is of course that so long as the train is moving the patients are inaccessible to the medical officer The Princess Christian train now it is understood in process of being fitted together for use in Natal will remedy a very serious defect in the arrangements and there is no doubt that it is more needed in Natal than in the western sphere of operations The Plan of the Hospital No onenot even a civilian who is supposed to have no eye for such matterscould fail to be struck by the workman like order in which the general hospital was set out and with the rigid mathematical precision of the lines The diagonal lines of the marquees were as absolutely true as the longi tudinal or transverse a feature that furnished at once evidence of the complete and careful attention to detail of every kind which characterised the hospital throughout I was informed that no positive instructions existed as to the precise plan on which a general hospital was to be laid out a rather striking example that demaximis non curat always the War Department Colonel Clery the PMO of the hos pital and Major Lucas RAMC taking advantage of the lati tude thus provided had to devise to a great extent their own arrangements of marquees and had certainly succeeded very ad mirably in the general design Some 89 marquees were in use as hospital wards at the time of my visit The space available allowed of an almost indefinite increase without in anyway altering the plan of the hospital The central row was devoted purely to administration Building was going on actively and in the centre of the ad ministrative block a large erection of wood and galvanised iron was nearly completed This was to be used as a reading and recreation room Close by was the operating theatre which was opened for use during my stay The theatre was of wood and galvanised iron with floors of concrete slightly sloping to one corner so as to allow of free flushing of the floor The lighting was ex cellent top lights being placed in the sloping parts of the roof The operations that the military surgeon maybe called in to perform may be of the most difficult nature and it is cruel to compel him to work as is the case too often in the hospitals here under conditions of semidarkness Practi cally there were two theatres divided by a partition with a wide door The second room was used when there was no great pressure of work in the theatre as an anaesthetising room Attached to the same building was the rray room The mains supplying current for this room furnished also electric light to the operating theatrean enormous boon and an advantage that one did not expect to meet with in a hospital practically so remote The accumulator battery was at the railway station in trucks These had to be sent down to Maritzburgto be charged The Medical and Surgical Divisions Wide alley ways separated the medical division and the surgical division respectively from the central administrative j block In too many of the military hospitals sufficient care did not seem to be taken to keep the medical and surgical cases apart This necessary precaution was difficult or im possible to observe no doubt when large numbers of patients were aggregated together and public buildings were utilei as hospitals  but the plan of mixing up the different cases was very objectionable and when many cases of enteric or dysentery were under treatment or bad septic cases were present positively dangerous At Mooi river the distinction was very thoroughly observed from the first Thus the medical officers were not as is the case in some hospitals called upon to treat cases of every kind at once but were kept very properly and very much to their own and the patients benefit to a particular line of practice Separation of Surgical Cases The principle of segregation was carried still further Septic cases were on the surgical sidekept apart as much as possible The cases of spinal injury were left by themselves as requiring special care and attention Venereal cases were lodged in a separate camp altogether some distance from the main hos pital and entirely distinct from it Most of the marquees contained six beds but at the upper end of the hospital where the slighter cases were lodged there were eight beds the regu lation number The Bedsteads It may be noted that for the most part the bedsteads were too wide and with eight in a tent little room is left If the camp is pitched on rising ground it is impossible as a rule to arrange the beds so that all shall slope in a convenient direc tion and wide bedsteads have really to be packed in rather without regard to the comfort of the patient lying in them The difficulty of moving or lifting a patient on a wide bed stead is much greater than on a narrow one and when the case is one of fracture particularly when the fracture is of the femur the sagging of the wirewove frame constitutes a serious objection and one prejudicial to the patient A great variety of frame is found in the different hospitals It would seem desirable to adopt a regulation pattern of a more convenient height than the majority of those in use here and of a regu lation width that would allow more space in the tent while contributing to the patients advantage and comfort Sanitary Arrangements The sanitation of the camp was all that could bedesired and the precautions especially that were not only enjoined but rigidly enforced in dealing with the dejecta in the enteric and dysenteric cases were admirable Rules and written regulations however complete and minute are useless with out constant personal supervision Orderliesand nurses too for that matterare but human and in their anxiety to observe the actual letter of the law often strangely err in understanding its spirit An incinerator at some little distance from the hospital provided for the prompt destruc tion of soiled dressings etc The Water Supply The water supply was taken direct from the river which here flows with a fairly rapid stream A small donkey engine pumped the water up into a tank raised on a scaffolding above the level of the highest point of the camp This tank was circular and made of galvanised iron a contrivance that has been found of the utmost value Such tanks are light easily moved by rolling and readily cleaned The water was run off from this reservoir through a sand and gravel filtering bed and then into the boilers for thorough sterilisation before it was distributed to the camp Thus treated the water could be readily further filtered through the Berkefeld filters Unless water be delivered in a fairly pure state into these I filters it is almost out of the question to secure due observ ance of the regulations with regard to the use of the Berkefeld filter If there is any sediment in the water the candle of the filter becomes clogged and the process is then so slow and laborious as to render it almost useless That the filter is an extremely efficient one all agree but in active servicejn a hot climate its employment is perpetually evaded Laundry Both the medical and surgical wards were most thoroughly equipped Laundry difficulties which in a wet climate are much more formidable than might be imagined had been efficiently provided for Milk and Eggs The supply of fresh milk left something to be desired and indeed this has been a great difficulty throughout in the Natal hospitals Ideal milk was in great request and 774 mSLSSSiJTHE WYNBERG HOSPITALSMaroh 31 190a many of the men asked for this in preference to the fresh milk which had to be boiled before it was served out The time of delivery of the milk which had to travel far was necessarily rather uncertain and in an uncertain climate like that of Natal there was also a liability to the whole stock being delivered in a sour state Eggs too were scarce and fetched a high price Comforts and Luxuries The small luxuries and comforts which count for so much in the mind of the public when it turns its attention to hos pitals were provided in abundance Of tobacco too there was an ample supply The openair method of treatment which the climate permits and which has been so widely and wisely adopted in the military hospitals allows of free use of tobacco in wards without annoyance to nonsmokers Tobacco has a very real value in the treatment of such cases as abound in military hospitals in time of war A full supply of tobacco for smoking in whatever form it might be preferred would in the field hospitals and dressing stations be second only in value to morphine and would very often most advantageously replace it Men waiting their turn to be dressed after they are brought down from the fighting line often positively crave for tobacco and it acts as a most efficient and harmless ano dyne A box of cigars or cigarettes would often give as much relief as the hypodermic syringe and fit a man far better to stand a rough journey from the dressing station into the field or stationary hospital The value of tobacco is recognised bat still not recognised enough The Nursing Sisters At the time of my visit there were only nine nursing sisters at work in the hospital Nursing in the sense it is ordinarily understood was therefore practically out of the question A general superintendence was really all that the sisters could rovidevaluable beyond question but still of necessity so imited that its value was reduced to the smallest compass If the principle is recognised of having nurses in hospitals at all a sufficient number should be provided to enable real nursing to be carried out It was in contemplation to erect imme diately marquees for 200 more patients in anticipation of the relief of Lady smith making some 800 beds in all But it seemed by no means certain that additional nurses would be forthcoming The Organisers I have given only a very imperfect sketch of what appeared to me reviewing the hospital with an absolutely unprejudiced eye as a very perfect organisation Only a few weeks ago the site was practically a hayfield covered with wiry grass through which one had to wade in wet weather knee deep Now by dint of hard work and energy controlled by judicious foresight and directed into the proper channels by chiefs who possessed a real gift of organisation the field is converted into a village and this village is one of the most efficient and wellmanaged hospitals I have hitherto met with The natural advantages of site remoteness from habitations proximity to the railway etc have been utilised to the fullest and the net result ie one of which the PMO Colonel Clery RAMC may well be proud No commanding officer could well be more fortunate in his staff and the share that Major Lucas RAMC has taken in providing for the efficiency of the hospital is acknowledged by all Clinton T Dent THE WYNBERG HOSPITALS By Sir William Thomson Chief Surgeon Irish Hospital South Africa Capetown March 6th 1900 We have been unable to move to Naauwpoort owing to the block on the railway With a single line it is difficult to carry up reinforcements and at the same time to bring down nearly 5000 Boer prisoners But we are promised an early transit to the junction which is near the Free State border and on the road to Bloemfontein The hospital there is full and help is badly needed so that we hope to  lend a hand  there very soon T wq qnxinuH tr pav a second visit to Wynberg as some xainloads of wounded had come down from Paardeberg They had suffered much before they reached the train For three days many of them had travelled in ox waggons exposed to the heavy drenching rains of that region but once the luxurious hospital train was reached they travelled the 600 miles to Wynberg with all comfort In No 1 Hospital I met Colonel Greer who conducted me through several wards and I saw several men whom I had visited before There were many nenr wounded Boers but although they had arrived in a rather dilapidated condition the5 were now clean and cheerful In one ward Boers and our own wounded were mixed They are on excellent visiting terms but the political question when it is broached sometimes interrupts this cordiality The prisoners are treated precisely as our own men They are indeed on parole now and although there are the usual guards the Boers who are able can leave the wards and move about the beautiful shady groves which are part of this delightful spot or receive their visitors in the wards I asked several how they were treated The first said  We could not be better treated in a firstclass hotel Others bore like testimony I asked if they got enough to eat and they testified that they were very well treated in this respect  They could get anything They were all well dressed in clothes provided by the hospital authorities A father and his son were amongst them I asked their name Thompson said the boy and he told me that his father was born in England and coming out at an early age was now a burgher of the Free State I went to see No 2 Hospital which is under the charge of Colonel Duke It is accommodated in tents I was glad to find an old resident pupil of my ownMajor Lougheedin charge of the surgical side The tents are large marquees of the usual size There are boarded floors and beside every bed is a small shelfed table The sheets and bedding were scrupulously clean and the patients were clothed in sleeping suits with which they had been provided on reaching the train I was particularly struck by the fine healthy appear ance of those who were not suffering from severe wounds There were English Scotch and Irish and a few Canadians all fine stalwart fellows One of the latter had five bullet woundsnone of them serious He enjoyed his preeminence The Highlanders were recognisable by the colour of their legs The knee and a little above and below were sunburnt almost quite black  and one or two men told me that their bare legs suffered a good deal from the fierce sun on the veld I spoke to a Highlander who had come down from Paarde berg with a bullet wound of the ankle It was not serious and I refer to him only in connection with a curious coincidence He was in hospital a couple of months ago with a wound in the same foot He recovered and went to the front N c w he found himself back again in the same tent in the same bed and with another wound in he same foot Major Lougheed showed me a young fellow who had a bad brain wound I Perforating Bullet Wound of Brain  Hemiplegia  Trephining  Becoveiy The bullet entered on the left side from before backwards ploughed through the motor area and passed out There was paralysis of the right side Both entrance and exit openings were enlarged by the trephine and fragments of buried bone extracted The paralysis disappeared There had been a little suppuration anteriorly but I found the patient doing well He had practically no symptoms In this division seven or eight gunshot wounds of the head required trephining and only one case which developed abscess has been lost The compound fractures of the thigh form an interesting group In all those cases where the injury to the shaft is done by highvelocity bullets the comminution is very severe  sometimes the loss of substance is so great that union appears almost hopeless  yet when the loose fragments have been removed the results are excellent Of a group

FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA Fbomjwr Special War Correspondent Maritzburg February 10th 1900 SLIGHTER BULLET WOUNDS OutPatients The graver varieties of gunshot wounds naturally attract chief attention but the slighter injuries have also a peculiar in terest in the present campaign The recoveries are indeed often so remarkable that the term  slight injury is a very elastic one and must be construed only as signifying that the patient is likely within two months to be able to return to active duty Through the kindness of Major Browning RAMC I was enabled to see all the cases of gunshot wounds in the Fort and Lower Barracks Hospital at Pieter maritzburg the men being specially paraded for the purpose The bulk of these had been wounded in the action at Colenso on December 15th and were seen about four weeks later Practically and in civilian phraseology they were out patients Many of the cases were simple flesh wounds that had healed at once and completely without any trouble The extent of extravasation in some of these cases was noteworthy and suggested that the injury was by no means confined simply to the parts traversed Flesh Wounds The hard cicatriciai cord resulting from the passage of the Mauser ballet was often more marked when the bullet had traversed a large muscle In a remarkable number of the cases the wounds were of the thigh and in the close proximity of the femoral vessels The apertures of entrance and exit resembled each other absolutely In a case in which the gluteal region was traversed on both sides the four wounds were ail exactly alike Cases in which great and persistent pain follows a flesh wound where the bullet has passed close to a nerve have been already mentioned in a previous letter Such are very common but were naturally not among the patients attending medical inspection Wounds f the Hand and Wrist and Foot In a fewa very fewinstances fingers had been ampu tated but more it seemed with the object of giving the most useful hand possible than because the injury of the bones of the finger or phalangeal joints was such that local recovery could not take place or because any septic complications threatened One man had threelfingers wounded The bullet grazed the skin over the back of the little finger and just grooved the proximal phalangesof the third and fourth on the back The wounds healed at once but the power of extension was much impaired Such grooving of the shafts of the longer bones appears to be rare  usually a fragment is broken off The small bones of the carpus and tarsus are constantly drilled without any apparent comminution by the Mauser bullet Thus one patient showed a transverse wound of the anterior half of the tarsus  the wound healed throughout at once In another case the entrance wound was over the middle cuneiform bone and the exit through the os calcis The bullet probably traversed the scaphoid and astragalus as well as the two bones named There was no impairment of the utility of the foot When the small diameter and the rapid rotation of the Mauser bullet are taken into consideration it is of course not very remarkable that so little mischief is caused The injury to the bones is scarcely greater than is in volved in inserting a screw for fixing together the fragments in a bad fracture or a broken olecranon So long as the wound is aseptic no harm should result and in the great majority of Mauser bullet wounds the track is perfectly aseptic from the first apart from treatment Wounds of the Patella and KneeJoint Many cases have been noted in which the patella has been cleanly drilled through by bullets Such cases almost uni formly do well unless complicated with injuryjf the popliteal vessels or nerve Extensive hsemarthrosis may form in the knee but subsides without trouble A man with a wound of the knee received about a month previously illustrated this The bullet had passed through the patella obliquely and made its exit on the outer side of the joint No trace of the injury to the bone could be felt and the joint in which there had been considerable effusion of blood was perfectly mov able In one case at Wynberg the bullet a LeeMet ford caused a transverse fracture of the patella In this instance the entrance wound was in the popliteal space I have not been able to hear of any other cases of fracture of the patella though very possibly some will come to light hereafter The contrast between the results of wounds of the kneejoint in this and previous wars will certainly prove very striking Heating of the Mauser Bullet A curious case of possible burn from a bullet was shown in a wound received by a corporal in the Queens Regiment The bullet possibly a spent one had struck the shaft of the tibia close to the crest transversely and apparently had drilled the bone There was a little irregularity of the bone and a frag ment may have been displaced Close to the exit wound was a mark resembling a burn the extent and shape of a bullet The patients account was that he had felt himself hit and felt something burning his leg On removing the puttie the bullet was found lying under neath it The man stated that it was ured hot a perhaps pardonable exaggeration The bullet at any rate was too hot to hold in the hand without pain The bullet was not a ricochet in appearance Another patient gave a somewhat similar account In this instance the bullet entered i inch to the right side of the eighth dorsal spine and made its exit 3 inches below the clavicle on the same side without travers ing the thoracic cavity The bullet dropped down inside the shirt and burnt the skin of the abdomen The bullet was found inside the clothes a day or two later Such accounts have to be received with a certain amount of caution but undoubtedly the mark on the skin of the abdomen did re semble a burn It is often supposed popularly that the tem perature of bullets is greatly raised by the friction of the air The supposition does not seem to rest on an experimental basis Arrest of movement would develop heat of course but the prodigious range of the smallbore bullet shows that the friction is exceedingly slight Markers at rifle butts are familiar with the fact that ricochet shots which are recog nised by the peculiar hum they make in passing through the air and which often fall deadby the shelters or drop back off the target if picked up at once are warm or even hot  but in such cases the movement has been violently arrested It is possible that some heat might be developed by the arrest of the bullet by the clothing but in such a case the missile cannot have been travelling with any great velocity A ricochet shot loses the spin in its longitudinal axis that it acquires in passing through the rifled barrel but as it glances off after the impact it may revolve on a transverse axis turning over and over in its night It is therefore unlikely to make the small wounds of entrance and exit characteristic of the perfect smallbore bullet Moreover the nickel sheath of the bullet will probably split up as the bullet strikes the earth and bounds up or glances from it It is occasionally stated that the cicatricial cord resulting from the passage of a smallbore bullet through soft tissues is due to the cauterising action of the bullet Such a view is hardly to be taken seriously The cicatrix resembles no doubt that which might be caused by passing a thick galvanic wire through the tissues and then raising it to a temperature suffi cient to burn the tissues But the cicatrix of a bullet wound is not produced in that way The velocity with which it passes through the tissues is too great to allow time for any cauterising action even if the bullet were at white heat Injuries of the Head and Neck The injuries of the head and neck were not numerous A private showed a wound of the side of the neck The exit wound was into the pharynx and the man spat up the bullet Instances of the kind were numerous enough in the days of round bullets and low velocity but are not likely to occur often with modern firearms Another patient showed a trans verse linear scar over the frontal sinus The bone beneath was deeply and irregularly grooved and evidently the anterior plate of the bone had been rather extensively fractured be March 17 190aHOSPITAL SHIPS AT DURBANmSIwSSal 66 having like the inner table of the calvarium in cases of gutter fracture No trouble had resulted save rather pro fuse epistaxis and apparently the injury to the supraorbital nerve did not threaten any evil consequences Wounds of the Thorax A private in the Kings Royal Rifles was wounded at the action of Elandslaagte by a bullet which traversed the scapula and thorax Some haemoptysis followed the injury but there was no other untoward symptom The wound healed through out at once soundly Many of the patients with similar in juries though apparently completely recovered are troubled with shortness of breath on slight exertion and this seems usually to be the case where both lungs have been traversed even when there has been no pneumothoraxwhich is seldom seenor hsemothorax a complication which occurs pretty frequently Wounds of the Liver Another private also wounded at Elandslaagte had a more extensive wound The bullet entered in front close to the right side of the sternum on a level with the seventh costal cartilage The exit wound was seen 3 inches above the right sacroiliac joint The possibility of the wounds in such cases being caused by different bullets must always be taken into consideration seeing that in a vast number of cases there is no appreciable distinction between the apertures of entrance and exit  but in this case there seemed no doubt that the bullet had traversed the right lung and the liver The direc tion of the wound corresponded to the position the man was in when the wound was received The wound had healed throughout without causing any trouble at all In another case in which the bullet had probably traversed the upper part of the liver superficially there had been some hsemat emesis but practically no other symptom Wounds of the Intestine In the following case the small intestine was probably wounded The injury was sustained at the action of Colenso on December 15th The Mauser bullet entered close to the posterior superior spine of the ilium on the right side The exit was on much the same horizontal level between 3 and 4 inches from the umbilicus and to its left It is almost inconceivable therefore that the small intestine could have escaped injury The man had been without any food for many hours before the wound was received and stated that at the time the abdomen was collapsed No vomiting followed the injury but for two days there was much disten sion This latter symptom gradually passed off and recovery took place uninterruptedly Four days after the injury the man according to his own account was able to walk about having probably noted the absence of the medical officer and nursing sister Whether true or not it is at least possible in the absence of any specific orders being given to the orderly to keep the patient in bed For the best of hos pital orderlies do not watch their patients with the unweary ing and intelligent attention so characteristic of a good trained nurse In this instance no operation was done I can recall only a very few similar instances of recovery where the small intestine was presumably wounded Cases in which the large gut was injured as far as could be judged followed by complete recovery are rare but moire common Full sta tistics are needed before the question of operative interference in gunshot wound of the abdomen can be properly discussed and these are not yet to hand The impression at present seems to be that the results of laparotomy have not so far been encouraging Everything depends however on the time that elapses between the infliction of the wound and the laparotomy Hitherto as far as I have been able to ascer tain the time that has elapsed has been so considerable that the chance of recovery was but remote Very protracted oper ations are hardly feasible in a field hospital when there is any rush of wounded and by the time that the patient has been transported to some place where there is opportunity for per forming the exploration with due deliberation the most favourable moment has passed and the difficulties to the oper ator are vastly increased Moreover as the above and other cases show recovery may take place in cases in which if they were seen in civil hospitals soon after the injury exploration would in most instances be advised Clinton T Dent THE HOSPITAL SHIPS AT DURBAN NATAL By Sir William Stokes MD FRCSI Surgeon in Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland and Consulting Surgeon to the Field Forces in South Africa Pietermaritzburg Natal February 7th 1900 On February 2nd accompanied by Major MacCormac RAMC Senior Medical Officer Durban I visited and inspected the four hospital ships then stationed in the harbour at Durban These were the Nubia the Maine the Lismore Castle and the Avoca The first and two latter of these have in an incredibly short timeabout ten days I heardbeen converted from passenger and troop ships into floating hospitals The transformation was effected entirely at Durban In the firstnamed vessel 216 patients were accommodated of whom 100 were convalescents The light space ventilation baths liftsworked by handfrom one deck to another movable electric fans swinging cots etc showed that there were few requirements unthoughtof to secure the comfort of the patients Colonel Hodder had the medical and surgical care of the patients assisted by four civil practitioners Dr Ashton showed me two very remarkable cases that were under his care both happily convalescent In the first case the bullet entered about  an inch to the right of the eighth or ninth dorsal spinous process and passing through the lung emerged i inch below and to the right of the right nipple The patient had some slight haemoptysis after he was wounded but since that no bad symptoms whatever In another case the bullet entered about 1 inch below the spine of the right scapula and emerged a little to the left of the sacrum The length of the traverse of the bullet was i8 inches The wound in this case remained perfectly aseptic and is now quite healed the patient does not suffer any inconvenience except occasional pain which he refers to the lumbar region In the Lismore Castle and Avoca the arrange ments for the comfort and convenience of the patients were most satisfactory Dr Brodie with three assistants has medical charge of the first of these It has accommodation for 264 cases  of these 150 were convalescents and 114 under treatment or  cot cases  as they are termed In the officers quarters there were 16 cases of which 4 were  cot cases and the remainder convalescents Dr Hamilton one of the assistants showed me some very remarkable cases The first was a multiple injury the patient having been shot in four different places namely through the neck the right knee the leit leg and the fore arm He is rapidly recovering from all these injuries In another case the ball penetrated the nose down to the frontal bone passed downwards perforating the hard palate and ulti mately emerged at the left side of the neck without injuring the tongue or lower jaw The third case was a very sad one The bullet penetrated the lower dorsal spine Immediate paralysis of the left lower limb followed the right lower limb remaining normal The last case I saw on the Lismore Castle was to my mind the most remarkable of all The bullet struck and penetrated the forehead on the left side high up and emerged at the ver tex a little to the right of the occipital protuberance The only result of this wound was total blindness of the left eye with optic atrophy 1 next visited the Maine which is under the direction of Lady Randolph Churchill and is organised and financed by American ladies The vessel had just arrived from Cape town and was not yet ready for the reception of patients There is accommodation for 187 patients Although the arrangements were still in a state of unpreparedness owing to the vessel having just arrived it was obvious that little or nothing had been omitted that experience knowledge and apparently unlimited financial resources could procure There were spring beds of the latest design thick indiarub ber matting on each side of the beds ingeniously constructed bed tables and head rests electric fans etc The strong electric lights were modified by elegantly designed green shades all of which Lady Randolph Churchill told me were manufactured by Mrs Joseph Chamberlain There are elec tric cooking appliances of all kinds refrigerators and floral and foliage decorations in abundance In fact everything that 664 mSLwaxHOSPITALS AT RONDEBOSCHMarch 17 1900 could be suggested for the comfort of the patients was to be found The medical and surgical staff with Colonel Hens man at their head consist of fortyv persons  there are five sur geons five sisters the remainder being orderlies and nurses The nursing staff is under the skilful direction of Lady Randolph Churchill Messrs Burroughs Wellcomeand Co who have furnished the medicine in the dispensary have pre sented a very beautiful and ingeniouslyconstructed cabinet fitted with medicines in the convenient tabloid form On the outside of the cabinet is the appropriate motto  No distance breaks the tie of blood In addition to the fittings and ap pliances already mentioned there are baths for fever cases and provision is also made for Roentgenray photography The operating theatre has all the most recent appliances furniture of metal and glass and perfect arrangements for sterilising instruments dressings etc If anything could be fairly criticised about the Maine it would certainly not be in reference to its fittings and arrangements but the vessel it self does not compare favourably with the other hospital vessels I inspected The low ceilings between decks and the small port windows appeared to me to be structural defects likely to interfere with both ventilation and light Lady Randolph Churchill most kindly spared no pains or trouble to let me see all the admirable arrangements she has made and I cannot speak too highly of them Were it not that this communication has already reached too great a length I should like to mention several cases of gunshot wounds I have seen Many of these are of absorbing interest and the results likely to be hardly credible to those who have not seen them  but later on I hope to forward you memoranda of some of these that I have seen and been con sulted on Many of them will doubtless furnish problems the solution of which will test the ingenuity skill and re sources both of the physiologist and pathologist THE HOSPITALS AT RONDEBOSCH From Our Special Correspondent at Capetown February 20th 1900 Enteric Fever At present things are still fairly quiet at the general hospitals The cases cleared out of the advance hospitals preparatory to Lord Robert8s brilliant march were not generally of much in terest and were mostly convalescent and the casualties hitherto in that march have been infinitesimal A few cases have come down from the Colesberg operations and will be dealt with later when I come to speak of the Rondeboseh hos pitals whither most of them have gone The influx of cases from the front has generally more of a medical than a surgical aspect Enterics are coming in pretty freely to all the general hospitals most of them of course in a convalescing stage Still they are not in sufficient quantity to shake ones belief in the sanitary arrangements at the front At this time of year enteric is more or less rife all over the country and to expect freedom from it in camps would be to expect the unattainable The station hospital is getting  a good number of cases in the earlier stages from the camps at Green Point and Maitland and from the various stations along the railway line Four cases of this affection landed from the Australian transport a few days ago Three of them commenced to be ill some ten days after commencing the voyage the fourth only a few days before landing The three first cases are convalescing steadily The other cases of enteric recently admitted have been of a somewhat severe type generally It is noticeable that at all the hospitals a large number of typhoid cases persist in a prolonged pyrexia of an erratic character the temperature in the fourth fifth or sixth weeks running up to 103o or so every evening with a drop nearly to normal in the mornings for a few days  then the range becomes less the maximum being perhaps ioo for a few days more but then mounting again This constantly happens without any perceptible explanatory complication and with the utmost care in diet and regimen Exactly the some thing is observed in civil practice One case died at the Station Hospital last week Violent haemorrhage came on on the twelfth day and later symptoms of perforation with localised peritonitis The case had been hitherto a mild one with only very moderate diarrhoea At the necropsy a per foration quite the size of a shilling was found just above the ileocsecal valve This perforation was evidently through a gangrenous patch and a plugged vessel around it The Peyer patch lesions corresponded to the assumed date of the disease The medical officer in charge of the enteric ward informs me that he finds nothing controls diarrhoea in typhoid fever so effectively as the indigenous drug Monsonia which I mentioned in my last letter Enteric Fever in the Inoculated At No 3 General Hospital where there are a large numbe of cases of enteric fever a certain proportion of whom have been inoculated it is very instructive to note the tem perature chart8 In all the inoculated cases which I have seen except one the temperature has dropped steadily and punctually at the fourteenth day or thereabouts and has j never gone up again The uninoculated cases run on with the erratic temperatures I have described before At Ronde bosch the favourite drug in typhoid fever appears to be salol but I think most of the elder hands at all the hospitals have very little faith left in drugs except in complications The New Bearer Companies Some modification of the arrangements with reference to the recently raised bearer companies has been made D Com pany went up a few days ago under Major Nicol RAMC but it has been taken over bodily by the officers of one of the RAMC companies and Major Nicol has just returned He is to take permanent command of E and his senior sub altern will be SurgeonLieutenant Vaux of the Royal Canadian Medical Corps The junior will be Lieutenant Fryer whom I mentioned last week SurgeonCaptain Black on account of a breakdown in his health is not able to go to the front after all E Company Medical Staff Corps leaves tonight or tomorrow Both these newlyraised companies present a very creditable appearance and will be very fit for bearer work Movements of Hospitals No 6 General Hospital has arrived and is to be fixed at Nauuwport Four Canadian nursing sisters have been posted to Wynberg It has been arranged that Lord Iveaghs hospital will be at Beaufort West This Karoo town is extremely well situated but is a perfect hotbed of typhoid However once on the Karoo Matjesfontein and Beaufort West are practi cally the only places

move Phthisis after Lobar Pneumonia Owing to the approaching change of seasons it is becoming a question what should be done with the phthisical cases which are accumulating Apart from ordinary cases of the disease there is a notable tendency which it is a little difficult to explain for quite a number of men who had had lobar pneumonia to develop a rapidlyadvancing form of phthisis directly as a sequel of the former affection Dr DarleyHartley who has charge of the medical wards in the right wing of the station hospital emphasises this tendency y and has verified his diagnosis early by bacteriological investi gation Hitherto it has not been considered advisable to send those patients home to an English winter while none of the base hospitalsthe station hospital least of all on account Of its dusty and windy situationare suitable for openair treatment more especially as these cases are mostly of a rapid md high febrile type Should any of the general hospitals De

right on their guns but each time to our great dismay and diappoint ment the ene myagain opened fire They were however event ually silenced about 4 PM On going over the enemys po sition on the other side of the river on the fol lowing day one could see seve ral of our shells and hundreds of shrapnel bullets in the midst of the enclosure that protected the Boer guns butunfortuately for reasons to be given later onn the enemy got away with the whole of their artillery The gunners also did excellent work shelling the town and the other guns so heavy was the fire that not a house escaped being struck and the hotel was set on fire To give the reader some idea of the heaviness of the fire I took the following notes A small stable built of mud walls 4 inches thick and covered outside with galvanised iron the front wallthat is to say the one directly opposed to our fire 20 feet long and Io feet high contained the following aper tures a I0 produced by unexploded shells b 3 irregular shaped by burst shells c 571 by bullets7 are the exits of Mauser bullets fired by the enemy 31 are entrances of Lee Metford bullets fired by our troops the remainder 533 are all shrapnel Most of these latter lay embedded in the mud wall that is to say they penetrated the iron but failed to penetrate the mud for more than half an inch All the Lee Metford pierced the wall and entered that on the other side but failed to pierce it The Mauser in like manner pierced the front wall and failed to pierce the second The reason that 7 Mauser bullets pierced the front wall of the house that is the wall facing uswas the fact that the rear wall of the house contained an open door and the bullets that came through it had only one wall to traverse The unburst shells passed through both walls entered another house 50 yards almost impreg nable and it seems a marvel that we were ever able to per suade the Boers to leave it Practical ly the whole of our attacking force was marching across an open plain in full view of the ene my while they were absolutely and completely hidden They lay behind trenches which extended along the near bank of the river for a distance of at least two miles Behind their trenches the ground sank to the level of the river so that their men horses and their largest waggons could travel along the whole of their position on both sides of the river with almost absolute safety from our fire The river was studded with boats used to ferry men to and fro and to convey ammunition as required On the other side of the river the ground gently inclined upwards and here in strong positions were placed their Hotchkiss anI other guns The enemys position was as far as I a noncombatant could judge an ideal one in every respect but not a man of us knew as far as I am aware what a verit able hornets nest we had got into CASUALTIES Taking everything into

vastly superior force while advancing ourselves across an open plain We had anticipated a brief and easy victory and in consequence the men were not rationed and a battle was fought and won by stomachs that had not seen food for twenty four hours Water was terribly scarce and every water cart that came near the front had to beat a hasty retreat The heat was terrific and last but by no

I learnt this in a curious manner On the left of our line I saw a horse bolting riderless it was evidently an officers charger as there was a sword etc attached to the saddle I sent a bugler to catch the horse and found it had a Mauser bullet wound through the near foreleg and there was blood on the bridle stirrup and saddle Drawing the sword one read  Methuen from Chapman Fears at once arose that the general was wounded and so alas he was though luckily the wound was not serious Firing ceased about an hour and a half after sunset Next morning at daybreak our guns opened fire but a few shots sufficed to prove that the enemy had trekked during the night and thousands must have made a midnight march We ascertained later from prisoners that the enemy greatly feared a night attack with the bayonet hence this hurried retreat They left all their artillerybehind them but shortly after midnight discovering that we had not crossed the river they returned and removed the guns to Spytfontein where they are now encamped What a chance we lost Why the reader may well ask did we not push home our attack at the close of the fight or shortly after Because the men were so done up by the heat of the day the fatigue of the long and hard days fight scarcity of water and want of food that they were barely able to put one leg before the other Thus was lost one of the best chances we have had this campaign of capturing the enemys guns without loss of life Next niorning I went up and down the enemys lines on both sides of the river expecting to count the Boer dead by hundreds After three hours careful search I was able to count i8 dead Boers and 75 horses so that unless they buried or carried away their dead their loss would appear to have been marvellously small It is impossible at present to form even an estimate of the number of their wounded THE BOERS AND THE RED CROSS There appear to be men whose aim seems to be to under estimate our losses and to grossly exaggerate the losses of the enemy men who delight to start tales that stretcherbearers and ambulance wagons are fired upon by the enemy etc I fail to understand their motives Broadminded soldiers must see that stretcherbearers cannot help being shot No Boers would purposely fire on a Red Cross party is my belief The Boer Hospital here was struck by shell more than once and all our ambulance waggons were struck by their missiles a pure and unavoidable accident on both sides I can myself give an instance in which the sickberth steward of my ship was dressing a wounded marine whilst the dressing was being put on the patient received a second bullet in the other leg but with bullets dropping all round one it would be unfair to say that the Boers aimed at either the Red Cross or the wounded man This particular incident occurred during our last battle at Graspan THE MAUSER AND TH3E LEEMETFORD The next morning we quietly marched into the town and occupied it The day was spent in burying the dead The field hospital was very crowded this morning over 400 dead and wounded The wounds produced by the Mauser bullets are all that could be desired the entrance and exit are practically of the same size and very minute Most of the patients make an uninterrupted recovery It is a more humane bullet than our own LeeMetford for two reasons its calibre is less and its velocity is considerably higher I must have seen some thousand bullet wounds by now including those I saw in the FilipinoAmerican campaign My expe rience includes also some experiments I made this year at Weihaiwei in the course of which I fired over iooo rounds of Remington brasscoated bullets and nickelcoated Lee Metford at all sorts of animate and inanimate objects includ ing their penetrating power upon various metals a series of experiments I hope to publish later on My experience has led me to the conclusion that those wounds which heal up most rapidly and give the least trouble are wounds produced by bullets having the same characteristics i A very high velocity 2 A flat trajectory so that they hit apex first and do not keyhole 3 A hard smooth sheath with a smooth rounded apex it A close range for the same reason as 2 a bullet at a long range may hif the objei side oni If I were to tabulate theLwe missiles in the order in which the wounds produced by them were progressively more serious from above downwards the table would read something as follows I Mauser 2 KragJ6rgensen 3 LeeMetford 4 Manstopping

Filipinos 8 Remington lead bullets or the MartiniHenry 9 Remington brass bullet with brass sheathing removed so as to expose the lead nucleus Io Shrapnel bullets xI Shell or their fragments I have no acquaintance with explosive bullets it is said the Boers have used them but I think this to be exceedingly doubtful Most thoughtful men will agree that the Boers have proved themselves to be brave men and instances of a violation of the laws of civilised warfare are few and far between THE BATTLE OF MAGERSFONTEIN December 13th 1899 YESTERDAY we attempted to oust the enemy from their posi tion in the Spytfontein and Magersfontein kopjes but I regret to say we signally failed and today we are in the same posi tion but with a loss of Iooo men there are about 700 dead and wounded and about 300 missing The Black Watch lost very severely2I out of 29 officers It seems that they advanced in the night in quarter column and at dawn were still in this formation and within easy range of the enemys rifle fire The Boer losses it is quite impossible to calculate as the Kaffirs that came in from their camp after yesterdays battle tell the most widely divergent talesfrom 6 dead and 40 wounded to 2000 dead and wounded Judging from past battles I do not think their losses are a tenth part of our own Our lyddite shell from the 47 naval gun has a magnificent effect to the eye sending up a vertical column of earth and dcbris to a height of about 50 or 6o yards It is claimed by the inventor to kill by concussion within a radius of 34 yards from the site of the explosion The shell weighs 46 lbs and is charged with the high explosive called lyddite chemically a picrate I should estimate that quite 20 per cent of the Boer shells do not explode The cause of this is doubtful whether due to a defect in the shell or its fuse or whether to a scanty supply of these projectiles cannot be stated In the action at Belmont when our naval guns were shelling the Boer artillery at 3500 yards range we watched shell after shell pass over our heads and strike earth about 700 yards in our rear sending up a cloud of dust but not bursting gradually these shell fell shorter till one landed between our guns That was the last plugged shell the Boers fired each subsequent one was a bursting shell and we very quickly had several of our bluejackets hit fortunately for us however their artillery was soon silenced and they retired The second theory therefore is probably the correct one having found the range with the comparatively harmless plugged shell they then use bursting shell I have only witnessed the effect of the shock of the explosion once it was in the person of a Highlander A shell exploded about ten yards over his head he was untouched by any frag ments but the concussion must have produced some curious pathological change in his nervous system as he has never ceased now ten hours swaying his head to and fro with a pendulumlike motion similar to that of the china dolls with the nodding head so commonly seen in the London streets His intellectual faculties have also been considerably dis turbed as he is only half rational THEI GLORIES OF WAR Last night there were hundreds of our dead and dying left in the field in fact it has taken two days to collect them and much suffering has been entailed One poor fellow walked into our lines with a towel on the end of his rifle he was raving mad and had been wandering about for hours with a portion of his frontal lobe protruding through a Mauser exit wound in the fore part of his skull The medical men have had a terrible time of itworking in cessantly for thirtysix hours The field hospital presents a JAN l3 Io0 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRIOA Til Iat ead but impressive sight one mass of wounded inside rows and rows of dead outside it is a sight I think would cure once and for all those worthy individuals who talk of the glories of war THE HOSPITAL TRAINs The hospital trains are beautifully equipped and reflect the greatest credit on the Army Medical Department It is quite a treat to see the nursing sisters attending to their arduous duties amidst all this blood and thunder with the same zeal and care they are so well known to display in our hospitals at home THE HEALTH OF THE TROOPs The health of our troops is excellent beyond a few cases of diarrhoea sunstroke and sunburn there is no sickness With regard to the latter trouble the Highlanders are chiefly afflicted why are men sent out into this fierce sun in petti coats P It is all very well to talk about the uniform being the essence of esprit de corps but is not this carrying it too far  Surely they might be allowed to go into action at any rate as other men go As it is their legs become covered with crops of vesicles few of the men like their dress for this kind of work the beauty of the kilt and sporran is masked by a khaki flap and when these two part company the aspect is both ludicrous and alarming I saw one man returning yesterday from his brush with the enemy in a pitiable plight in his own words he had had to  take  a barbed wire entanglement at the double and emerged a bleeding mass with his kilt hard a starboard his khaki flap halfleft turn and his sporran dangling on the wire WATER SUPPLY AND REFUSE DISPOSAL The water supply is bad being derived directly from the muddy river B oiling is imperative The air for a radius of over 2000 yards from the centre of the camp is tainted with the smell of halfburied horses there were about 200 dead horses and mules buried after the battle of Modder river but thanks to the vultures the ants and the humble microbe they are rapidly being reduced to harmless skeletons DUST SPOUTS AND LOCUST STORMS The latrines are of the simplest long troughs are dug in the ground and screened off at night they are filled up with earth We have had one or two very severe thunderstorms but the things we dread most are the dust storms or as I would venture to term them dust spouts for they are analo gous to waterspouts Vertical columns of dust extending to a height of about 150 yards and travelling at a speed of 6 or 7 miles an hour pass through the camp and play havoc with all and everything making life miserable rifles are thrown out of gear food and water rendered nauseous and clothes spoilt We have had one  locust storm up here at Modder River for three hours the air was like a snowstorm but black One could not walk ten yards without colliding with hundreds of them every blade of grass was demolished and every crumb of biscuit or bread on the ground was pounced on by countless numbers After three hours they had all disappeared as mys teriously as they came The locust storm was travelling in a NNE direction Tonight at midnight we take our guns up to their position at the front and open fire upon the Boers at dawn December 14th 1899 TOTAL LOSsES AT MAGERSFONTEIN Since writing the above some more dead and wounded have been brought in bringing our total losses in the engagement at Magersfontein u to iioo dead and wounded I have also heard that one of the army medical officers to whom permis sion was given by the Boers to go up to their lines anc attend to our own wounded has been made a prisoner of war owing to the fact that a revolver was found on his person The two Generals have communicated with each other concerning him but General Cronje remains firm and claims that men and officers wearing the Red Cross should be unarmed I know the officer personally and regret his capture but at the same time all will agree that General Cronje is within his right From our Speolal Correspondent In Capetown December 20th 1899 THE BAsE HOSPITALS THE work at the base is now becoming very heavy indeed consignments from Methuens column arriving in rapid sua cession It is satisfactory however to report that the service is everywhere standing the strain As I mentioned last week No i is now full up and No 2 has well over 400 patients No 3 at Rondebosch is ready for occupation Two days ago when I was out at No 2 seven marquees were still in course of erection the construction of the floors taking some time Probably they are now complete The accommoda tion has been supplemented by the kindness of the autho rities of the Claremont Sanatorium who have placed that in stitution which is the property of the Seventh Day Advent ists at the disposal of the authorities as a hospiLal for con valescent officers This offer has been accepted and is some what timely as there is no accommodation for officers at No 2 MEDICAL CASES Medical cases as might be expected are beginning to come in somewhat more freely from Methuens column and the medical division of No 2 which is under Lieutenant Colonel OConnell is still keeping to its proper work Almost all the cases are either rhetmatism or dysentery The former come down mostly in a subacute condition with joint pains and slightly elevated temperature They have of course all undergone some treatment above For the most part they are doing well and no large proportion develop heart compli cations Civil Surgeon Hancock however showed me one case under his care with a very loud long systolic basic bruit audible most plainly to the left and quite localised Nearly all the rheumatic cases give a history of some days severe diarrhoea before the onset of the rheumatic symptoms Probably the connection between the two depends on the depressing effect of the antecedent diarrhoea more than any thing else The dysenteric cases are numerous and in this connection it may be mentioned that the affection known as dysentery has by no means the typical character of the endemic dysentery of India and other tropical climates The manifestations are not so severe neither is the prognosis either as regards death or chronicity so bad One sergeant major of the R AMC has however unfortunately succumbed to the disease in No 2 General Hospital As to treatment one medical officer with whom I conversed is giving pulv Doveri and another the magnesium sulphate treatment The results seem to be fairly good I saw one case of ordinary hemiplegia which is doubtless syphilitic and is steadily re covering under potassium iodide Two or three dysenteric cases have developed pleurisy probably rather an accidental concomitant than a pure complication Following the more recent trend of medical opinion I notice that the medical officers are not tapping except in the presence of some mani fest indication SURGICAL CASES On the surgical side the cases coming in present much of the routine character to which I have before alluded The remarkable success obtained with the perforating thoracic wounds is still evident The pleuritic effusion developed in a few cases generally becoming rapidly absorbed For this one has to thank the splendid physique of most of the men a factor largely dependent on the reserve element the excel lent hygienic conditions and the good and abundant food The record of cases of perforating abdominal wound continues to improve upon the experience of the speakers at the Ports mouth meeting of the British Medical Association Civil Surgeon Hanwell pointed out one case which is convalescing steadily with merely a symptom six cases of this class have so far done well Under the care of the same civil surgeon is another case of much interest A bullet had entered the buttock and emerged in the left groin perforating the lower and posterior aspect of the bladder going through the attach ment of the internal oblique ad smashing the left pubic ramus Of course there has been external extravasation on the left side but the exit for the urine has been and is free enough owing to extensive sloughing of the exit wound Now there is an aperture large enough to insert three or four fingers through which the shattered ramus and the opening The War In South AfricaSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2056 May 26 1900 pp

for the whole of India during the week ending May 5th the mortality being 2498 against 3365 in the previous seven day In Bombay city the subsidence of the epidemic has not been so great but the mortality fell to the extent of 52 the actual number of plague victims being 421 The hot weather therefore although it has brought an abatement has not coincided with so marked a decline in the plague mortality as the experience of previous years would have led us to expect in Calcutta the number of plague cases and deaths on April 25th 26th 27th 28th 29th 30th and 3ifct were  fresh

daily during the last week of April and from 30 to 40 deaths from the disease In Luc know the attendance at the hospitals has fallen off to a very great extent owing to a scare amongst the people that if seen to be unwell at all they will be taken to the plague camp There is no severe outbreak but the community are in a state of alarm In the Mysore province only 4 indigenous cases of plague were reported during the week ending April 20th Aden At Aden 86 death3 from plague occurred during the week endirg May ist Egypt At Port Said during May 14th 15th 16th and 17th 10 fresh cases of

Port Said seem to prsagea widespread infection The destruction of rats and mice has beendetermined upon by the authorities There is considerable local distress amongst the labouring population of Port Said owing to the quarantine regulations which has almost stopped all work at the wharves Certain French newspapers are protesting against the imposition of 3uarantine on th grounds that the disease is not plague but asimilar isease with another name This is a most dangerous doctrine and on the face of it untrue   In Alexandria one case of plague occurred on May 16th  4 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH THE NATAL FIELD FORCE From an Occasional Correspondent Enteric Fever Following almost immediately on the relief of Lady smith a sharp outbreak of enteric fever has occurred amongst the troops of the relieving force This is the more to be regretted as up to the final attack on the Boer position the force was practically free from the disease When however we conr sider the conditions to which the troops were exposed during their attack on Pieters Hill the wonder is not that enteric fever has broken out among them but rather that the out break has been so limited During the seventeen days that the final attack lasted the men slept in the open without a vestige of cover As the Boers were driven back our men took shelter in their trenches These trenches had been occupied by the enemy for many weeks without the faintest attempt at sanitation Their condition was indescribably filthy There was no help for it however and our troops had to occupy them for days together At the same time it was often impossible during the daytime to send up drinking water to the troops in advanced positions as every approach was swept by the Boer fire The men therefore drank from every pool in their neighbourhood whether it was contamin ated or not There can be no doubt that enteric fever existed amongst the Boer forces and that our men contracted the dis ease whilst occupying the trenches which they had captured from the enemy Most of the cases I have seen in Natal present the classical symptoms of enteric fever with this exception however that tympanites appears tobe a somewhat rare condition As yet I have not noted those hybrid cases to which the name typhomalarial has been applied in tropical countries In Natal at least the rash is usually very profuse and well de fined On the whole the cases are of moderate severity but a very large percentage far exceeding the average are attended by intestinal haemorrhage This no doubt is due to the fact that on field service it is impossible for patients to have the absolute rest and freedom from excitement which is so im portant a part of the treatment in permanent hospital The treatment at present in vogue in Natal is almost exclusively by intestinal antiseptics the only variation being in the re agent used Some prefer salol some carbolic acid some again Barney Yeos chlorine mixture Dysentery Dysentery is also very prevalent Some at least of the medical officers with the force attribute the disease to irrita tion of the intestinal tract set up by particles of sand dust etc which are accidentally swallowed with food or water With this opinion however I cannot agree It is easy by close observation to satisfy oneself that the dysentery from which the troops are now suffering and similarly all or almost all dysentery on field service is due to constantlyrecurring abdominal chills contracted during sleep O wing to the diffi culties of transport only one blanket for two men and one waterproof sheet for each man can be carried With this slight covering the men sleep on the ground in all weathers Under these circumstances the nightlyrecurring chills sooner or later bring on dysentery in those who are at all predisposed to the disease Sand dust impure water and indigestible food increase the liability to an attack by exciting local irrita tion but they cannot directly cause it In Natal the disease is seen in two forms namely  i CatarrhalIn this which is really a catarrhal colitis the motions consist largely of opaque mucus which is often slightly bloodstained There are few symptoms beyond an uncomfortable feeling of flatulence and distension with fre quent calls to stool If the patient is warmly wrapped up at the beginning of the attack it may pass off without any further treatment If neglected the attack may develop into the second and graver form It is in this the catarrhal form that a saturated solution of magnesium sulphate is found so useful  2 Ulcerative This which is much rarer and graver than the first variety is usually the final stage of the neglected catarrhal form It may however be a primary affection at May 26 1900JNOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOSPITALSmSSii 13 n least in some cases It is accompanied by marked depression and by all the graver symptoms of dysentery As the cases advance the motions contain more and more blood until finally they consist almost wholly of long black shreddy coagula When this form of dysentery is fully established treatment at least in the field is practically hopeless Every known remedy and combination of remedies including rectal injections of boric acid tannic acid and silver nitrate have been tried and have signally failed Hospital Administration Since the relief of Lady smith the Royal Medical Corps have had to face a most difficult situation the difficulties being much increased by the fact that in Natal there are practically no public buildings which can be taken over to meet a sudden emergency of this kind What it meant when 2500 sick and wounded were suddenly released from Ladysmith and added to the already huge list of sick and wounded belonging to the relieving force may be imagined Under the circum stances it was well that the corps in Natal had at its head two such experienced and able officers as Colonels T J Gallwey and W B Allin They have met the emergency with such energy and resource that all difficulties are rapidly disappear ing and it is confidently expected that in a few days the medical arrangements will again be working with their original ease and smoothness None however who are not on the spot can realise the difficulties which the Royal Medical Corps have had to contend with owing to reduced establishments and limited accommodation For years past the pruning hook has been vigorously applied to the Corps Under its use the strength of both officers and men has been reduced to such a degree that before the war commenced the establishment was insufficient to perform the duties which devolved upon it even in times of peace The deficiency has of course been made up by employing civilians but the great drawback to this system is that there is no reserve of trained officers and men to meet the numerous casualties which have already occurred At the present moment there is not a single field hospital in Natal which has its full complement of officers and men most of them having lost from 20 to 40 per cent of their establish ment from sickness and other casualties The Medical is the only unit which has to work under such a disadvantage Regimental casualties are made up as rapidly as possible by drafts from England The Royal Medical Corps however having no reserve to fall back upon cannot be dealt with in this way Several changes in the distribution of field hospitals have re cently taken place The Fifth and Sixth Brigades which now form the Tenth Division have gone round to the Cape to join the force under Lord Roberts At the time of their departure their field hospitals were so full of sick that they could not move They had therefore to be left behind The Fifth Brigade Field Hospital under Major G H Younge which has been present at each of Sir Redvers Bullers battles has joined the newlyformed Eighth Brigade so that it will no longer be known by its original number As the Fifth Brigade Field Hospital I hear that this unit has treated over 1000 cases of gunshot wounds and about an equal number of sick which is probably a record in field hospital work The Sixth Brigade Field Hospital under Major C W Thiele has joined the Seventh Brigade Contagious Diseases The present campaign has once more brought to the front the question of contagious diseasesand has shown how urgently some stringent measure is needed to check the spread of these diseases in the army It is only during a campaign that one can fully realise the ravages which result from venereal di seases Men who are the subjects of constitutional syphilis may continue to perform their routine duties during peace time Send them on field service however and they almost at once break down and develop the worst and most loathsome sequelae of the disease Large numbers of these men have reached South Africa only to flood the hospitals and occupy the accommodation which has been prepared for their wounded comrades THsestate of the late Dr William Chapman Grigg who died at Wynberg of enteric fever has been proved of the gross value of 8495119s 6d including personal estate and the nett value of 44945 ios iod SURGICAL NOTES FROM THE MILITARY HOS PITALS IN SOUTH AFRICA From our Special War Correspondent Capetown March 20th 1900 SECOND THOUGHTSContinued Wounds of the Thorax There is little that calls for remark concerning the surgical treatment of wounds of the thorax The question of extract ing the bullet in some of these cases will be dealt with later on The ordinary penetrating wound seldom required any operative treatment unless it were the removal of loose splinters of fractured ribs or sternum Hsemothorax was a very common sequel As a rule the condition subsided spontaneously Occasionally if the breathing was much embarrassed it was thought necessary to aspirate the pleural cavity This is an unsatisfactory proceeding at the best for hsemothorax for the rule is a sound one that in dealing with a large effusion of blood it is best to leave it alone if the blood and clot cannot be most thoroughly evacuated a condition that is seldom possible in hsemothorax Sometimes the elevation of the temperature led to the suspicion that pus was forming But the temperature in almost every case of hsemothorax rises two or three degrees above the normal n the early stages gradually sinking to the level of health in the course of a week or so if the case proceeds favourably It may be a mistaken impression though I think it is one that will subsequently be borne out by the returns when I say that in the earlier part of the campaign trouble but seldom followed those aspirating or exploratory punctures whereas later on empyema which was not revealed by the puncture occasionally followed Certainly in the later stages of the campaign in the months of February and March for instance and in the more trying damp and enervating climate of Natal cases of empyema occurred with more frequency wholly apart from any accidental infection other than that of the original wound These were treated in the ordinary way a portion of rib usually being removed A case of sup purating pericarditis the collection of pus being very exten sive was also I understand for I did not see this patient treated with success by simple incision Wounds of the Heart While on the topic of thoracic wounds mention may be made of injuries of the heart Judging by the wounds of entrance and exit and the direction there seemed little or no  doubt that recovery took place in some cases in which the heart was wounded There is of course nothing very novel or surprising in such cases and no very profound disturbance need be anticipated from a small clean bullet passing at high velocity through the muscular substance of this organ In one case at least in which the bullet passed through the cavity the effect was not immediately fatal the patient sur viving for a week or two The diagnosis of heart wound was verified but unfortunately I am unable at present to furnish precise details  I trust they may be forthcoming Empyema The cases of empyema did well for the most part the pro gress in the men being more like that seen in children There was however a tendency possibly the criticism is prompted by prejudice to the overuse of drainage tubes a tendency that might be defended as regards cases of empy ema but was decidedly wellfounded as a general rule with respect to deep suppuration Over and over again cases were met with in which convalescence was retarded and not pro moted by the routine employment of drainage tubing The best surgical practice has been modified considerably and with great advantage to the patient in this detail of late years and it seemed rather an anachronism to find in some of the wards that almost every opening that could accommodate a tube had got one in it Few surgeons now I imagine in our civil hospitals think it necessary to put a drainage tube as  routine practice into an amputation Such wounds out here are more favoured jn the matter of healing than at home but they were seldom allowed the chance of healing abso lutely throughout by immediate union In the same way the practice too often followed of stuffing gauze into any The War In South AfricaSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2040 Feb 3 1900

SUMMER MR FREDERICK TREVESS letter from Frere Camp which ap peared in the last issue of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL has been read with the greatest interest both by the medical pro fession and the public His graphic descriptions of the little town and the parched brown veld of the African summer are admirable and bring before us as scarcely any other corre spondent has done a picture of the camp dry dusty parched and rectless under a blazing sun The heat both at Frere Camp and in Ladysmith itself appears to have been great even for an African summer Thus Mr Treves says that on one day it was 1040 in the shade and that a clinical thermometer in a bag lying in the tent registered 104 5 A despatch from Ladysmith by runner dated January 21St states among other things that the heat was 1070 in the shade A heat of this degree does however not infrequently occur during the summer months in the upcountry towns of South Africa Thvis in Kimberley I have known the temperature over I00 F in the shade daily for weeks together With such weather as this it is of course usual and in fact almost neces sary in the normal condition of life that people should remain almost entirely under shelter during the middle hours of the day yet we read of our soldiers in one engagement after another exposed to the blazing sun throughout the entire day Fortunately in the dry atmosphere of South Africa these ex treme temperatures are not so oppressive as in moister climates nevertheless a temperature of I00 in the shade means something a great deal higher in the actual sun and where the sunlight actually falls on the body it produces a sensation almost as if one were being hit by a stick In the neighbourhood of Frere and the Tugela about Colenso the season would appear to have been unusually dry a condition which is usually accompanied in the summer by excessive heat Thus Mr Treves speaks of the river which is reputed to run through Frere as not running at all but consisting of a series of dams full of brownish water As a matter of fact this is the normal condition of African rivers for about nine months in the year It is only during the rainy season that they are actually full and flowing We have read several accounts of the Tugela being in flood but it must be remembered that the Tugela flows out of the main range of the Drakensberg and that it is from rainfalls higher up that these floods are usually produced It is a common feature of South African rivers to be flooded in this way by rainfalls in the mountains near their source and to flow afterwards it may be for hundreds of miles in a roaring torrent I0 to 20 feet aboye their usual height through an arid parched and rainless country The spot where the Tugela emerges from the Drakensberg is but little known or visited but it is of exceptional wildness and beauty Emerging high up on the mountains the river flows in a large body over the side of a precipice and down this it falls broken by occasional ledges for 4000 feet until at last in the valley below it descends literally in the form of spray The stream is thus changed during its downward course from a solid column of water into what is little more than vapour The floods that occur in South African rivers fre quently come suddenly down a dry river bed without warning and it is by no means uncommon for carts and horses or even waggons and teams of oxen to be swept suddenly away in crossing by a flood of this description KIMREERLEY From both Ladysmith and Kimberley heliograms of con siderable length have recently been published and whatever depression may exist outside there is no expression of this tone in the messages flashed forth by the garrisons We are assured from Kimberley via Modder River on January 24th that both people and garrison are in good health and are going about their tasks cheerfully An earlier heliogram of January 19th is equally satisfactory in its purport Thus it says the De Beers Comvany has undertaken the work of the sanitation of the town since the failure of the former con tractors through the capture of mules carts etc by the enemy Readers of my letters will perhaps remember that this was one of the dangers I anticipated to the health of the town but it has evidently been grappled with satisfactorily The ordinary water supply having been cut off that now in use is evidently pumped from the mines Owing to the wisdom and forethought of the authorities in regulating supplies the community is still enabled to obtain the absolute necessaries of life at normal prices although eggs fowls vegetables etc are at famine rates From these reports we may reasonably infer that Kimberley with a popu lation of over 20000 can continue to hold out for some con siderable time and we cannot allow ourselves to believe that in spite of some of our reverses this community will not eventually be relieved LADYSMITH The one item of intelligence which must be held to be satis factory whatever be the military course of events in Natal is that the general health of the garrison is much better From this we may infer that the typhoid epidemic is on the wane Some people write as though the relief of Ladysmith were the only step necessary to terminate this epidemic but it must be borne in mind that typhoid fever is not dependent on a state of siege nor would it vanish at the raising of the siege It will continue so long as men susceptible to its attacks continue to drink a polluted water supply without boiling it The entire evacuation of the town would of course terminate an epidemic dependent on local causes but should occupation in any form continue it is obvious that the radical cause of this epidemic must be traced and grappled with A Reuters telegram of January 2ist says that the fever has abated in the garrison doubtless owing to the dry weather This may pos sibly afford some explanation for as I indicated in my last letter one of the dangers of these tropical rains is that sur face drainage and occasionally even flooded latrines flow into the river and springs or other sources of water supply thus every thunderstorm unless careful precautions are taken may be the cause of fresh poisoning of the supply The question of the commissariat in Ladysmith now becomes if possible of deeper interest than ever and remembering the reason assigned for the change in the original plan of campaign it is as gratifying as it is surprising to read mes sages so late as January 24th speaking of the supplies still spinning out splendidly MAPEKING Again an interesting letter appears in the Tinmes of January 29th dated Mafeking December x899 in which the writer states that  immense stocks of food supplies had been stored in the town It is the knowledge of the valuable stores which are lying here which has inspired the Boers to court us so assiduously From this we may fairly assume that Mafeking at least can hold out very much longer if necessary and on the other hand if it has been reinforced by the troops from Southern Rhodesia as is stated from Transvaal sources it may prove a valuable base This statement though unconfirmed is not in itself impro bable As I pointed out in my last letter one of the difficul ties which a force from Rhodesia coming south would have to contend with would be a certain amount of malarial fever and probably a considerable amount of horse sickness in the low country but apparently the greater portion of this low country must have been traversed early in the summer and at Gaberones the force would be already emerging into the higher veld TYPHOID AT MODDER RIVER Although the health of Lord Methuens force has been reported to continue good it is to be noted that on January z8th 20th and 22ndthree deathsfrom typhoid have beenreported It is strongly to be hoped that energetic measures will be taken to arrive at the cause and that prevention of further attacks will be found practicable LYDDITE A letter has been received from a correspondent asking as to the physiological causes of death after the explosion of a lyd dite shell I have raised this question already in one of my FEBl 3 900 THE WAR N SOUTH AFRICA rKF  281 letters and had hoped that some of the readers of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL would have offered explanations Judging from the published accounts it would appear that the main effects of lyddite are due to shock produced by the concussion such as is caused for instance by the explosion of dynamite The effect of the explosion of dynamite on man I have observed on many occasions The most terrible explosion that ever came under my notice and probably the most terrible that ever occurred was that in I896 of three trucks laden with dynamite which were standing in Johannesburg outside the goods station The dynamite was of inferior quality being of Transvaal manufacture and the Hollander officials were shunting the trucks The result was an explosion which blew to powder every house within a radius of some 200 yards which wrecked houses for a further radius of 6oo yards and which partially wrecked some buildings three quarters of a mile away Thus I can well remember that one side of the Wan derers Pavilion which was afterwards used as a tempor ary hospital three quarters of a mile from the scene of the disaster was blown in The effect on men women and children in the neighbourhood was ter rible Fortunately the houses were scattered and the population not dense but some hundred were killed and another hundred more or less seriously injured Of those killed some showed actual injury from falling stones and timber others showed no visible sign of external violence Among the wounded were many cases of ruptured tympanum with hiemorrhage from the ears The effects I take it were due to concussion or in plainer English were the result of an actuali blow from the surrounding atmosphere The tremendous development of gas produced as in the case of all explosives an instantaneous and terrific increase of pressure in the atmosphere immediately surrounding the explosion It is in this way that lyddite acts and it is pre sumably in this way that sheep within an acre of the ex plosion of one of our largest shells are said to have been nearly all killed BOER MEDICAL CORPS The Globe of January 25th contains interesting details from a letter written to a friend in Berlin by Dr Schneider surgeon in chief to the Transvaal forces which I trust Sir James Sivewright has read He Dr Schneider says that the needs of the Boers with regard to surgeons bearers bandages and other appliances are better provided for than is generally supposed In I896 to 1897 he remarks incidentally enormous stores of arms and ammunition both from England and Ger many were imported into the Transvaal and Germanys chief share in the work of preparation consisted in supplying the Transvaal with surgical instruments drugs and hospital appliances To this end 590oco have been spent for the Boer Army Medical Service which is now thoroughly equipped He says  We have some English surgeons who are old settlers in the Transvaal and who have volunteered for service in the Transvaal army but the Boer troops show no confidence in them Referring apparently to the operations around Ladysmith he states that the severely wounded are sent by rail to Harrismith or to Glencoe as quickly as possible where the Boer women have gathered themselves together and friend and foe are most carefully attended The writer says that wounded Englishmen fall so frequently into their hands that the sur geons are most busily engaged withthem The wounded have as a rule almost the same treatment there s always ready for them a supply of fresh milk bread meat and whole some soups It is only natural that we Geiman surgeons should give our first attention to the Boers but so far we have never forgotten the Englishmen In case of a great battle where many on both sides would have to be attended to the writer says that  the Boer surgeons would not suffice to meet the claims made upon their services and as a matter of course would have to leave the wounded English to their sufferings This necessity might we suppose arise but it must be a painful one for any surgeon with a proper sense of the duties of his vocation to anticipate One of the honourable traditions of our profession is that such succour as we can offer is freely given to friend and foe alike and that a surgeon holding a high position even with the Boer forces should think it necessary to make the statement quoted above ciuses a somewhat painful impression THE DESPATCHES THE despatches published in the London Gazette of January 26th dealing with the operations in South Africa down to December 28th I899 contain some references to the work of the Army Medical Department which are eminently satis factory Belmont In the action at Belmont on November 23rd in which the first movement war made at 3 AM and which terminated at about 6IO AM by the capture of the heights and the retreat of the enemy the casualties it will be remembered were 54 killed and 238 wounded In addition 20 of the enemys wounded were taken into the British hospital Lord Methuen in his despatch of November 26th written from Enslin on November 26th writes as follows with regard to the medical arrangements of this fight  By 1030 my division was in camp by I all my wounded were in a comfortable house being carefully tended by 5 PM next day the hospital train conveyed the less severe cases to Orange River the graver cases to Cape town This is the most perfect work 1 have ever heard of in war and reflects the highest credit on Colonel Townsend Enslin In this action the force under Lord Methuen started at 330 AM on November 25th and was in action at 630 AM Lord Mlethuen describes the fight as far harder than at the previous engagement The Naval Brigade and the Ninth Brigade were left to protect the guns or assault a position if necessary the Guards Brigade and two companies of the Munster Fusiliers were left to defend Belmont Station The main idea of Lord Methuens operation was to march a division at once to Swinks Pan to work one battery round each flank and to send cavalry and mounted infantry well forward with the object of capturing the eastern force The operation was successful but the casualties were 24 killed and i66 wounded In addition to his own wounded Lord Methuen found over 30 wounded in the Boer hospital at Enslin He makes the following observa tion with regard to the arrangements carried out by Colonel Townsend RAMC I again draw attention to the exceptional organising power of Colonel Townsend at Swinks Pan At I130 PM I was informed that owing to all the ambulances having been used for taking the wounded to the train at Belmont I had scarcely a field hospital mounted officer only three ambulances and three stretchers I knew I had to fight next morning so got together fifty blankets in order to carry wounded with the help of rifles I also sent to Colonel Townsend to make arrangements for wounded by 3 AM a messenger having to ride seven miles to him He met me on the field with a full supply of ambulances and I never saw anything more of him or the wounded because he had a train ready for them between Grass Pan and Belmont His only complaint is that there is not much of his mules left an observation which applies equally to men and animals Modder River In this action which was fought on November 28th begin ning at 4 AM the number of casualties was 72 killed and 396 wounded Lord Methuen concludes his despatch by the follow ing observation of the work of the Royal Army Medical Corps  Again I call attention to the splendid hospital arrangements for at 445 PM on the day after the fight all my wounded were on the way to Capetown I am glad to have been slightly wounded because in no other way could I have learnt the care taken of the wounded and there was nothing officer or private soldier required that was not provided at once and the medical officers never tired in their endeavour to alleviate suffering The despatch also contains the following mention  He Colonel Paget draws attention to Captain Moores R AMC who although wounded in the hand said nothing but continued his duties Natal Sir Redvers Bullers despatch with regard to the reverse at Colenso does not contain any reference to the work of the Royal Army Medical Corps or of the hospitals but Major General Elildyard in his report on the night attack on Beacon Hill near Estcourt Natal on November igth states that 28 2 m n ICALJOURAL TTHI WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA B 3 9  Major Rickets commanded the bearer company and did good service both at the time and in connection with the removal of the wounded It will be remembered that the force by which the attack was made was under the command of Colonel Kitchener Early in the night there was a storm of extreme severity and the men lying out in it amongst the rocks were exposed to its full force The hill was successfully taken and some thirty horses captured but in accordance with instructions was at once evacuated Owing to the nature of the ground it would appear that there was considerable difficulty in re moving our wounded The cavalry under LieutenantColonel Martyr assisted in the work of getting the woundedof the 2nd Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment down the hill THE CLASSIFICATION OF WOUNDED The casualty lists issued by the War Office usually contain indications of the severity of the wounds received As the system of classification followed is probably not generally understood it may be of interest to explain it  Wounded is used as an inclusive term and gives no indication of the severity of the injury It is used only in preliminary statements forwarded home before the medical officers have had time to examine all the wounded and make a classified term Three classes of wounds are recognised Dangerous severe and  slight  but if a man is dangerously wounded and likely to die it is usual to state that his wound is  pro bably mortal The actual classification is of course made by the medical officer on the spot It is impossible to attempt to specify the nature of the wounds which would fall into these several classes but it may be said that a simple flesh wound would be entered as slight a wound implicating bone or joint would be entered as severe and a wound penetrating the abdomen chest and brain would be entered as dangerous THE YEOMANRY HOSPITAL ALL the arrangements for the despatch of the Yeomanry Hospital to South Africa are now in an advanced state The entire male personnel 150 in number including the medical officers and ten dressers will go by the Majestic which is ex pected to reach England very shortly She will take some days to coal and clean but it is hoped that she may be ready to sail or February ioth or 12th The nurses will follow on February ioth on a liner as neither the Majestic nor any other transport has accommodation for ladies With the nurses will go about ten female servants and ward maids The mat6riel of the hospital is timed to arrive before the staff who will find sufficient accommodation in the form of huts and tents already erected The site of the hospital has not yet been quite definitely settled there seems to be some possibility that it will be established at De Aar or some other advanced point on the lines of communication of the strong force which it is be lieved will now be pushed forward through the southern border of the Free State according to the original plan of cam paign Of course the ultimate site of the hospital will be determined by the CommanderinChief Lord Roberts and the Principal Medical Officer SurgeonGeneral Wilson In any case this hospital will be of the nature of a base hospital as is sufficiently shown by the fact that it has a staff of lady nurses who are not employed in field or stationaiy hospitals near the actual front There is a proposal to provide a Yeomanry Field Hospital but this we understand has not yet taken definite shape The medical staff which has been selected from a very large number who have offered their services is very strong and efficient and Mr Fripp is to be congratulated on the successful completion of this somewhat difficult initial task He has been

for funds and in addition a very large proportion of the equipment of the hospital has been given The various firms that cater for the wants of the medical profession have been second to none in their generosity and Messrs Down Brothers who are sup plying the instruments at prices very advantageous to the hospital have presented a quantity of enamelled metal furni ture for the operating

our work in the new domicile which we were fortunate enough to acquire We had set up house on a very large scale without deliberate preparation and we were suffering all the inconveniences of uch an enterprise Still no patient suffered Those upon whom the strain and stress fell were the few who had under taken the work determined that it should succeed The Hospital Board took over the building on June 15th The Medical and Nursing Staff On the 19th I transferred all the patients 83 remaining in the Irish hospital on the field It was a hard aays work We had no nurses  there were five orderlies one dresser Mr Thomson Dr Coleman and myself Each man had to be undressed and washed before being put into clean sheets But we took off our coats to it helped to arrange the beds and generally did orderly work all round Dr Coleman dis tinguished physician as he is never appeared to greater ad vantage and I give to him and to the rest of my small party not only my own thanks but those of the sick whom they so tenderly managed that day Since then the rest of our estab lishment has come up from Bloemfontein and now consists of Dr George Stoker Dr J B Coleman Dr Friel Dr

matron Miss Walker both of the Richmond Hospital Dublin In addition I have succeeded in getting twenty nursing sisters and I have supplemented our own Irish orderlies by a number of convalescents In this way we have got into harness But as our medical staff is less than half that deemed necessary in an army 520bed general hospital it will be seen that the work is arduous Several of the residentsMessrs Heys Bechett Marks Lewis and Johnstonhave selected wards to equip and the Hon Rupert Guinness has especially furnished the Iveagh ward named after his father We have got as a result sick quarters which would be the envy of many a hospital managed at home The furniture and bedding are of the best  on the walls are engravings of excellent quality giving to the wards rather the aspect of comfortable dwelling rooms than anything else We have erected a fine kitchen with five  ranges  and as many boilers for soup etc The sanitary arrangements I have already described in a

HOSPITAL ESTCOURT Sept i 1900 Roberts Hon Aileen Roberts Mrs Louis Botha and Mrs Lucas Meyer It was an interesting incident of the proceedings to see this little party in conversation repre senting as it did the opposed forces of the war A Deluge of Enteric When we opened we were deluged with enteric cases Every field hospital naturally sent in its worst cases for all these men were lying on the veld with only the covering of a tent and crowded to the number of eight in a bell Some of them were really moribund when they arrived and these and many more died On one day we had nine deaths It was disheartening work for there was very little margin of hope Gradually however there has been an improvement and we do not receive so large a proportion of bad cases There have been a few wounded Two of theseone shot through the spine with complete division of the cord  the other through the colon and liverhave died Another an officer shot through the left kidney has made excellent progress and although there is still slight hsematuria he has no other symptoms Death of a Doctor We have now received into this building 765 patients of whom 248 have been discharged and 49 have died leaving 468 at present under treatment I am sorry to report the death of Dr Teufel a German physician who had rendered service to our sick prisoners at Waterval with Dr Von Gernet He acquired the disease there and was admitted here but he was unhappily unable to resist the virulence of the attack He received a military funeral The Medical Commission The Medical Commission still exists and has been of the greatest service Some day I shall tell you more fully what it has done but I think I may say that in the absence of medical supplies and the frequent interruptions of railway communica tion it has saved the situation We have practically equipped all the stationary hospitals with blankets sheets mattresses underclothing bedsteads pyjamas and all kinds of drugs and dressings In some cases our difficulties were enormous Some articles could only be had by the halfdozen Clinical thermometers had almost vanished from the town Between this and Johannesburg we could only get a few bedpans We had to pay 16 for 24 and then we got some made at a pound apiece Some of the indents are amusing One wanted several dozen thermometers when only half a dozen were available in the district and then wanted 30 ear syringes We have furnished hospitals and nurses houses and we are asked to supply khaki uniforms and overcoats when there is not one to be had in the Transvaal The Com mission is a universal provider and it has borne the strain very well Foremost in the work are Mr Leigh Wood the Chairman and Mr Rupert Guinness who try to meet every demand now that Mr Murray Guthrie has gone home The CommanderinChief has given every facility for the im portant work and in this way as in others he has encouraged the efforts of the Commission His solicitude for his men who are enduring hardships is constant and untiring he Treatment of the Sick in South African Hospitals Rumours regarding the agitation on the treatment of the sick had reached us from time to time but it is only now that I have had a chance of reading some of what has been said I have not had any duty outside my own hospital I am not in a position to express an opinion from actual personal knowledge I do not doubt that great hard ships have been suffered I know that But there is a want of judicial calmness in the indictment which has swept public feeling with the force of a whirlwind It is so easy to make us  creep I have already said that the Army Medical De partment must be reorganised  that more nurses and physicians should have been sent out  that sanitarians should be part of the force on the field There is much to find fault with and improve But it is fair to the department to say that at present its mouth is shut and that no member of it may come forward now and state his case There was a grave miscalculation as to the requirements of the campaign but that miscalculation was not confined to the RAMC I think the department is strangled by rules and regulations  that it is not progressive if you like  but all these are matters to be considered calmly at the close of the war and corrected It is not the only department that will be improved by experience Some weeks ago Lord Roberts appointed a Committee here under the presidency of Colonel Gormley RAMC to collect evidence regarding the treatment of wounded and sick in the field I was invited to state my views and I have done so in a few notes When the Commission of Inquiry comes out I shall probably give evidence I shall have faults to find But meantime there should be some moderation and it ought to be remembered that the army is eogaged in war and not in the peaceful pleasures of life at home A VISIT TO NO 7 GENERAL HOSPITAL ESTCORT NATAL By Sir William Stokes FRCSL Surgeon in Ordinary to H M the Queen in Ireland  Consulting Surgeon to the Field Forces South Africa We received the following letter from the late Sir William Stokes just a week after his lamented death The covering letter dated August 2nd expressed the distinguished writers intention to leave for home on August 24th On July 16th while at Ladysmith I received a telegram from Colonel McNeece RAMC the able Principal Medical Officer of the General Hospital Estcourt asking me to visit Estcourt with the object of seeing some surgical cases of in terest and importance and for some of which operative inter ference it was thought might be indicated I accordingly started the day following and reached my destination at about 1230 pm Estcourt which is the seat of magistracy of Weenan Countyr is situated at a high altitude 3833 feet above the sea level Though a small provincial town it is one of some commercial importance and is situated close to the junction of the Bush mans and the Little Bushmans river the former of which is crossed by a railway bridge of five spans The climate which has the reputation of being one of the most equable in Natal is dry and invigorating and it was no small relief to inhale the pure air of the district after the choking dust and pestilen tial atmosphere of Ladysmith There is little tillage to be seen the district being mainly pastoral Like most Natal villages it is situated in a hollow surrounded by partlywooded hills which form a charming contrast to the bare inhospitable mountains and hills which surround Ladysmith The site for the General Hospital No 7 was judiciously selected by Colonel Gallwey CB the Principal Medical Officer of Natal and is situated about half a mile from the Estcourt railway station on the Ladysmith side The area of the hospital covers about 60 acres on the crest and side of a gentlysloping hill It had never been camped on or fouled and water from the town reservoir was easily laid on On April 5th orders were received from the principal medical officer to increase the accommodation from 500 to 920 beds all of which were soon occupied chiefly with enteric cases a large proportion of cases of dysentery being aleo under treatment The Hospital Staff The hospital is divided into two divisions medical and sur gical with subdivisions attached to each for convalescents Major Barker RAMC is in charge of the medical and Major Porter RAMC of the surgical division These officers are ably assisted by the civil medical officers who have done most excellent work The same may be said of the nursing sisters army army reserve and colonial Major Hayes RAMC acts as Registrar and Secretary The other officers originally connected with the hospital were Captains Beveridge Waring and Kelly Of these Captain Beveridge has been ordered to the front Captain Waring to a field hospital and Captain Kelly has been invalided Cases of Gunshot Wound Major Porter RAMC showed me several cases of gun shot injuries of exceptional interest most of them having been received in the engagement at Almonds Nek on June nth The first was one in which a bullet penetrated the right thigh and left kneejoint There was no suppuration in the wounds but a somewhat rigid ankylosis of the knee Sept i 1900THE GENERAL HOSPITAL ESTCOURTmbjSai 599 supervened The limb however was in a good perfectly straight position Another case was one in which a bullet passed through the cheek into the mouth through the tongue and finally emerged in the submaxillary region The haemorrhage in this case was very great and with difficulty controlled  but ultimately the patient did well I also saw two cases of chest wounds in both of which the lung was perforated The bullet in the first case entered an inch to the left of the right nipple and emerged below the angle of the left scapula  and in the second case the wound of entrance was two and ahalf inches below the centre of the right clavicle and the exit three inches below the angle of the scapula on the same side There was copious haemoptysis immediately after the wounds were received which happily however did not recur Both cases have done well I also observed an interesting head injury A pompom shell exploded close to the patient and one fragment entered the right mastoid and apparently destroyed the auditory appa ratus as the patient was perfectly deaf on that side Another fragment of the  pompom  inflicted a severe flesh wound of the right arm The last case that struck me as of interest was an arteriovenous aneurysm of the right femoral artery and vein the bullet having entered the inside of the thigh and passing behind the femur emerged on the outside of the limb I thought the case a suitable one for operation Operating Room and Laboratory The operating theatre was built quite on the same lines as that at the Mooi River General Hospital and possessed all the essentials for successful operation work which was mainly undertaken by Major Porter RAMC The rray room adjoins the operating theatre and hard by are a wellfur furnished dispensary and a laboratory with every requisite for carrying out bacteriological research Dieting This is carried out on the same principle as in a large general hospital at home but more liberally  Brands essenc e Bovril champagne etc being freely issued at the discretion of medical officers The cooking staff is frequently tried to the utmost to provide all extras ordered such as custard puddings rice and sago puddings etc It must be re membered that each patient gets a separate pudding not a helping from a large one The dieting of patients con valescing from enteric fever is very carefully looked after and they get numerous extras and minced chicken after 14 days normal temperature  but frequently patients persuade their friends to give them solid food when nurses or orderlies are out of the wards and the consequences are relapses which are sometimes fatal Treatment of Enteric Fever No hardandfast rule was followed In bad cases of haemor rhage transfusion of a saline solution at a temperature of ioo F either into subcutaneous tissue over the abdomen lumbar regions or into the cephalic veins was employed with excellent results Widals test was carried out in the great majority of the cases also in doubtful ones It was found in certain cases of dysentery that enteric fever coexisted and that moreover as a patient convalesced from dysentery say from ten to fifteen days after admission symptoms of enteric appeared Careful records have been kept of cases inoculated and not inoculated against enteric fever It is impossible at present to give a decided opinion on the adequacy of its protection Un doubtedly many cases inoculated contracted the disease but as a rule the type was milder Unfortunately those who had been inoculated had unbounded confidence in its efficacy and consequently did not take as many precautions against con tracting the disease as they should Sanitation The water supply is from the town reservoirs and is filtered by means of the PasteurChamber land pressure filter and Berkefelds handpump filters The dry earth and pan system is in use for ordinary and convalescent patients the pans being emptied and cleaned out four or five times a day dusted with McDougalFs or chloride of lime powder There are two sanitary attendants in each latrine whose duty it is after a pan has been used to put in a little dry earth and chloride of lime or McDougalls powder thus disinfecting each stool Strong iron watertight carts remove the faecal matter and urine to deep pits some mile and a half off These pits are 10 feet deep and every morning the faecal matter of the day previous is covered with a layer of dry earth and chloride of lime Enteric stools and urine night stools and bedpans are kept outside the tents at one special corner the space occupied being sprinkled with chloride of lime every day When a bedpan is required the orderly on duty in the tent brings it to the patient first ascertaining that it is clean externally and internally On being used he replaces it outside the tent calling the conservancy man Indian sweeper who removes it to the special latrine set apart for enteric stools The contents are placed in a covered receptacle The bedpan is then washed in a i in 1000 solution of perchloride of mercury dried and a small quantity of izal i in 20 poured in just sufficient to cover the bottom The same process is carried out with urinals About 50 yards from the enteric stool shed is a large oblong shallow boiler placed on a brick furnace  into this boiler the enteric stools urine and disinfectants previously used are poured sawdust is mixed with the same fluid and the whole boiled until almost dry from evanoration  the contents are then shovelled out placed on the fire beneath and burnt a little petroleum being added Thus the whole faecal matter sawdust etc are turned into ashes There are 60 conservancy coolies a certain number being told off to each row of tents latrines lava tories etc The water used in the tents for the washing of patients etc is poured into pails kept in the same place as the bedpans nightstools etc and removed to sanitary pails on wheels also two large iron receptacles tiltcarts these when three quarters full are wheeled to deep tanks 500 yards from the camp and below it Outside the cookhouse and washhouses are large galvanised iron tanks capable of holding 100 gallons  these are constantly being emptied by conservancy men Iy means of the large pails on wheels No water of any sort is allowed to run over into drains etc There are no drains in camp all fluid being removed to the tanks The tank principledevised I understand by Col McNeece is as follows Two large pits are dug out of the soil 40 by 20 feet and 10 feet deep  these are connected by a pipe 4 feet from the top and at the lower end of the further one is a wire grating fixed in on the principle of a sluice which prevents any matter running into the drain which follows a devious course for 300 yards until the water is thoroughly clear  it is then allowed to flow over the veld where it is absorbed in the course of 100 yards or less The principle of the tank is as follows  All slop water from tents washhouses cook house etc is poured into the first tank also all orange skins empty milk tins egg shells etc etc are put into the tank Each day a layer of earth is thrown in and the whole surface sprinkled with chloride of lime The capacity of the tank is about 1000 gallons it soon fills and the supernatant water flows into the second tank where it settles is sprinkled over with chloride of lime daily and when it reaches the level of the drain flows off As soon as the first tank is filled to within four feet of the top it is closed and filled up the other being filled up also and the same process again begun with fresh tanks Disposal of Enteric and Dysenteric Bed Linen and Clothing This is brought direct from the wards to the disinfecting shed All linen soiled with faeces or blood is first washed in a solution of izal and water then boiled in a similar solution and then placed in Threshs steam portable disinfect or as is all linen and clothing used in enteric tents It is then dried and handed over to the washing contractor direct The impression left on me by all I saw at the Estcourt General Hospital was most favourable and the greatest credit is I think due to Colonel McNeece RAMC and the officers military and civil who are working under him for the unre mitting industry care and attention to the minutest details which has characterised their work by which they have succeeded in bring the hospital to its present state of high efficiency The War In South AfricaAuthors Frederick Treves William Thomson G H Makins and George AshtonSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2049 Apr 7

Forces Durban March 9th 1900 The Fifteendays Battle No 4 Stationary Field Hospital reached Chieveley on Sunday February nth after a very tedious march during which we felt the heat severely The heat on the two following days was intense and on Wednesday February 14th I watched the army moving out for the fourth time The men were not in the best of spirits and had not for gotten the circumstances under which Colenso was ap proached on the last occasion On Thursday February 15th firing began and from that day until Thursday March ist there was fighting every day and all day There is no doubt that these fourteen days represent the very hardest part of the campaign The men were moving forward through a terrible country and as soon as one ridge or kopje had been taken another had to be faced There was seldom a night during which we did not hear rifle firing This in most cases came from the Boers who were in constant terror of a night attack and would fire furiously from their trenches on the least alarm The casualties during these fourteen days were comparatively few but among them were many serious cases The men moreover were exhausted by the continued fighting and were often lyiDg out for some time before they could be reached by the stretcherbearers Thus many were lying out all night and one man I talked to was unfortunately out two nights and a day The Boers gave him water to drink and at the same time relieved him ofall he had on him Wounds Produced by Expanding Bullets If was during these fourteen days that we began to have experience of  explosive  bullets The wounds made by bullets so named are easily recognised They are marked by a small point of entrythe usual Mauser woundand by a large and terrific wound of exit This wound may form an open cavity as large in diameter as halfa crown At the same time there is great shattering of the bone As certain statements as to the extensive use of explosive bullets by the Boers have appeared in newspapers from time to time it may be well to state precisely what has been the experience gained among our wounded In the first place practically all the wounded who have fallen in the Natal campaign from the Battle of Colenso December 15th to the Relief of Lady smith have passed through the Field Hospital to which I have been attached The only excep tions are represented by some few convoys of wounded mostly slight cases who Twent down to the base direct by ambulance train We have therefore dealt with some thousands of instances of shot and shell iDJury At the first battle of Colenso and at Spearmans Camp we met with isolated instances in which the injury was probably due to a MartiniHenry bullet or to a missile from a  sporting rifle In these cases how ever the lesion was marked by a comparatively large point of entry and was hardly typical Some may have been due to explosive bullets but it was not until after February 15th that I came aeross examples of injury due undoub tedly to bullets of this type We have admitted a good many instances of these particular wounds although the proportion among the whole number of the wounded is quite small Moreover a large quantity of softnosed bullets have been found among the ammunition left by the Boers in their flight I have myself found many on my visits to the Boer trenches and am bringing specimens home The Green Bullets I am also bringing back a box or so of  poisoned bullets  as our soldiers call them found among the Boer ammunition These bullets are covered with a bright green composition I do not for a moment suppose they are  poisoned The coating appears to me to be a mixture of sulphate of copper and tallow and is probably used to keep the rifle barrel clear I propose to have this green material ex amined chemically when I return to London I have turned over many heaps of Mauser ammunition in the Boer rifle pits and trenches but have found no examples of the split or decapitated bullets which have been picked up by some They must I think beuncommon We have not met with any in No 4 Hospital Vagaries of Bullets The vagaries of bullets are apparently without end I have seen now several instances of wound of the prostate and base of the bladder both with communication with the bowel and without When the prostate has been involved epididymitis has not been uncommon In one or two in stances of abdominal wound a faecal fistula has followed without any peritonitis We have had several cases in which isolated nerve trunks have been cut across without other injury In a case under the care of Dr Elliot the Mauser penetrated the lower end of the thigh wounding the popliteal artery and causing a fracture of the femur which involved the kneejoint A large traumatic aneurysm followed with great swelling of the whole limb The kneejoint was filled with blood which showed a visible pulsation This case was treated by rest and elevation and when last seen was doing well Certain traumatic aneurysms with distinct and widespread pulsation have vanished with rest Five Bullet Wounds in the same Engagement As an instance of extensiva Mauser wounds I may men tion the case of an officer recently in  No 4 His ex perience p I imagine unique He was shot in an engage ment and fell He rose and tried to walk towards a fellow officer He was again shot and fell He got up and made a second attempt to move when he was shot a third time He could move no more and when lying on the ground was shot a fourth time In due course the stretcher bearers arrived and as he was being carried down he was shot a fifth time and one of his bearers was shot at the same moment so that his stretcher was dropped to the ground Of the five injuries four involved the limbs and back The third wound received was a penetrating wound of the abdomen below the level of the umbilicus the bullet escaping apparently at the buttock The poor fellow was much collapsed on admission had some abdominal pain some tympanites and slight vomiting Following the indi cations taught by this campaign I advised no operation He made an excellent recovery thanks largely to his pluck and fine health and the care of his surgeon Major Kirkpatrick A Maxim Bullet I may here mention that I have seen only one intact Maxim bullet extracted The man was under Dr Elliots care The bullet caused a long gutter fracture of the skull in the temporal region opened the meatus and was cut out in the neck near the clavicle There was a considerable escape of brain matter The bullet was detected by the telephone probe The Trenches on Fort Wylie On Sunday February 25th I paid a visit to the Boer trenches on the north side of Colenso and was especially interested in the entrenched hill called Fort Wylie This kopje WS literally covered with burst shell and with shrapnel bullets On the face towards the river almost every stone showed a mark of lead The Boer trenches on the other hand contained such a quantity of empty Mauser cartridge cases that it is evident the enemy had not  een inactive on this historic hill  The trenches were April 7 190THE BELIEF OF LADYSM1THjiSinSS 3 wide and beautifully made and were nearly neck deep In some the earth had been scooped out in front so as to form a retreat when a shell burst The Boers had in all cases provided the trenches with a means of escape and had made elaborate attempts to ensure some comfort In many trenches there was straw and in one an iron bed stead Among the dbris in the trenches I was struck by the strange number of patent medicine bottles They were almost as numerous as the gin bottles The Boers had provided themselves with ingenious coverings against the rain but they left behind the impression that they had little regard for cleanliness Colenso Village The pretty little village of Colenso was represented by a woebegone street of brokenuD and ruined houses There was not a sound pane of glass in the place In one ruined cottage the sole relic of the time of peace was a childs battledore The railway station was little injured but was Tendered unattractive by the fact that the Boers had left a dead horse in the booking office The animal had been long deceased Colenso railway bridge with its fine spans was a fantastic ruin a chaos of broken iron hurled into the rushing stream a mere muddle of bent beams hanging tolts and twisted bars Some precarious planks placed from one piece of wreckage to another formed the sole means of crossing the Tugela on the day of my visit Not long after I had left this muchdeserted village the Boers began to shell it again from Groblers Kloof Poor Colenso  Through all the glorious days of the summer now passing away there has been little but death and riot among the gardens which made the sleepy hamlet homely and among the cactus and the mimosa which made it beautiful The Storming of Pieters Hill  Late on the afternoon of February 27th we were able to view from our camp at Chieveley the grandest spectacle of this campaignthe storming of Pieters Hill The hill formed a long ridge or series of ridges immediately in front of Umbulwana The afternoon was a little cloudy but a wide patch of sunshine rested upon this fateful ridge and made it luminous against the gloomy walls of Umbulwana A more terrific display of artillery fire could hardly be imagined It was incessant The sound was as the roar of some uncanny sea The air above the ridge was alive with the little white clouds of shrapnel and on the ground itself were flashing lyddite and common shell and brown columns of dust which rose up and were made brilliant by the sun When the artillery ceased the rifle fire could be heard and later on we knew that the trenches had been taken at the point of the bayonet and that the way to Lady smith was open The Journey to Ladysmith About 6 pm on Wednesday February 28th our cavalry reached Ladysmith and on Thursday March ist General Buller reached the longbeleaguered camp On the follow ing day Friday I had the good fortune to enter the town My journey to Ladysmith was not accomplished without difficulty I had to follow the road the army had taken as the main road was not known to be free from th enemy and moreover the bridge leading to it had been blown up The distance from Chieveley to Ladysmith by the route I took was between 23 and 24 miles I took my covered cart called in the camp the bus with ten mules and two of my Kaffir boys My servant rode in front to pick out the road With me came my remaining nurse Miss McCauland Mr Day an army chaplain MissMcCaul was the first woman to enter Ladysmith after the siege We took provisions water and forage for two days We left Chieveley at 630 am and the first part of the journey was over the battlefield of Colenso We came across the skeletons of Colonel Longs horses the horses attached to the lost guns  they were lying in a line as they felJ their bones were whitened but still attached to them were the collars and harness The road now became very rough over ridges and down into dongas over boulders and deep into ruts  now the mules would be at a fair trot and now they would be dragged to a standstill At last we reached the hill commanding the pontoon bridge over the Tugela At the top of this precipitous height was the mighty con voy of ox waggons with food for Lad y smith The waggons could be counted by hundreds and the cattle by thousands The hubbub could not be surpassed The lowing of the oxen the shrieking of the Kaffir boys the bellowed orders of the convoy conductors the groaning of colliding wag gons made a compound of sound worthy of the scene Among the rabble would be seen ambulance waggons water carts isolated gun carriages and ammunition wag gons bread carts mounted officers hurrying through weary pickets returning to camp and a few  Tommies  tramping along with a cheery indifference to the restless struggling crowd Owing to the kindness of the staff officer I was able to get my cart over the pontoon without delay Crossing the Tugela The actual road above the pontoon was the very steepest declivity I have ever seen negotiated by structures on wheels In England it would no doubt be indicated by a placard  This hill is fatal to cyclists The bus empty of all occupants slid unsteadily down the incline rocking like a ship in a troubled sea and the mules had to put on their best pace to keep clear of the onrushing wheels The river at the point of crossing is exceedingly pic turesque The steep rugged banks are rendered beautiful by mimosa and cactus and below the pontoons the torrent breaks into foaming rapids while upstream is the cele brated waterfall of the Tugela From the river the road wound on of its own sweet will to the foot of Umbulwana It ran across plains and down into valleys and over spruits and across boulders and through mimosa groves and over dusty wastes We had to ford a river at the foot of the great hill and as the mules were nearly carried off their feet and our waggon was flooded with the stream we were glad to land on the opposite bank We were by this time many miles ahead of the slowmoving food convoy and had the advantage of seeing the country undisturbed Boer Camps We passed the Boer camps which showed every evidence of a hurried departure The cooking pots were still on the camp fires  the rude shelters under which our hardy enemy had lived were still intact The ground was strewn with refuse with the remains of the last meal with discarded articles of clothing with empty bottles and barrels with fragments of chairs and tables with empty flour sacks and above all with the straw which is quite a feature of a Boer settlement There were no tents The shelters were made of boughs of beams of wood from adjacent farms of iron railings of barbed wire of plates of corrugated iron and of casual patches of canvas and of old sacks In some of the trenches the shelters were very elaborate and varied from an almost shotproof retreat to a simple tent made out of two raw cow skins stretched over bamboos These wild camps amid a still wilder country suggested a brigands stronghold and inheed one could not help being frequently reminded of certain familiar theatrical scenes which pro fessed to represent the conventional brigands retreat The only evidences of a gentler mood were provided by a discarded concertina and by a letter I picked up on the road side The letter was from a Boer wife at the home farm to her husband in the trenches As we passed along the road we met with many evidences of a hurried flight The dead horses were very numerous and left by the road side with traces cut were carts light spider carts water carts waggons and such cumbrous impedimenta as wheel barrows and a smiths forge One waggon had fallen head long into a donga in the dark and was an utter wreck 84 iJlBS55JTHE BELIEF OF LADYSMITH Aim 7 ioo The First Sight of Ladysmith At last on mounting the summit of a little ridge we saw before us a wide green plain of waving grass and beyond the plain and under the shelter of purple hills lay the unhappy town of Ladysmith Ladysmith looks very Sretty at the distancea cluster of white and red roofs otted about among trees and surmounted by the white tower of the Town Hall The military camps were placed at various points about the town The Garrison The first of these camps we reached was that of the gallant Kings Royal Rifles They had made some sort of home for themselves on the side of a barren and stony hill They had of course no tents but had fashioned all sorts of fantastic shelters out of stone and wood and wire They had even burrowed into the ground and had re turned to the type of habitation common to primeval man Among the huts and burrows were many paths worn smooth by the restless tread of weary feet The path the most worn of all was that which led to the water tanks The men themselves were piteous to see They were thin and holloweyed and had about them an air of utter lassitude and weariness Some were greatly emaciated nearly all were pale nearly all were silent They had exhausted every topic of conversation it would seem and were too feeble to discuss even their relief I reached Ladysmith at 230 pm and the food convoy did not arrive until late the same evening so we had the sad opportunity of seeing Ladysmith still unrelieved unrelieved so far as the misery of hunger was concerned I had no food at my disposal but I had fortunately a good quantity of tobacco which I doled out in pipefuls so long as the supply lasted It would have taken many pounds however to satisfy the eager wasted trembling hands which were thrust forward on the chance of getting a fragment of the weed We outspanned at the outskirts of the town and the first person to come up to me was a skeleton of a Kaffir who offered me a shilling while he pointed repeatedly to his mouth He was really starving and devoured the biscuits I gave him like a wolf There is no doubt that the coloured people left in Ladysmith have suffered very severely Starvation City The town is composed almost entirely of singlestoreyed houses built of corrugated iron with occasional walls of brick or cement In the suburbs of the town these houses are made as villalike as possible by means of verandahs and flower gardens and creepers The main street of the town however has no pretensions to beauty and is merely a broad road with corrugated iron shops on either side On walking into Starvation City ones first impression was that of the utter emptiness of the place Most of the villas were unoccupied were closed up and indeed barricaded The gardens were neglected and everything had run wild The impression of desolation was accentuated by an occasional house with a hole in its roof or its wall due to a Boer shell All the people we met were pallid and holloweyed and many were wasted All were silent listless and depressed There were no evidences of rejoicing no signs of interest or animation and indeed as I have just said Ladysmith was still un relieved Nearly every shop was closed or even barricaded Signboards showed that here was a coach builder and there a grocer The chemists shop appeared to be empty of everything except the coloured water in the large bottles in the window Such shops as were open were dark and desolate These were many grim evidences of better days Thus one restaurant presented among other cheery signs the announcement of  Meals at all hours Another establish memt was gay with placards of  Ice creams Notices of  groceries of all kinds for sale made radiant a shop which i was empty of everything but a table and seme rough chairs Such was the aspect of the weary town Streets empty of all but a few tired and listless men stores without goods shops without customers a railway station without passengers a post office without letters stamps or post cards No words indeed can fully describe this city of desolation this little colony of the almost hopeless this poor battered wornout hungry town of Lady smith with a bright summer sun making mockery of its dismal streets The wretchedness of the place was not mitigated by the horrible smells which greeted one at every corner nor by the miserable dirty river which crawled slimily through the place The Eeturn Journey We left the town about 5 pm and met on our way bacfe the long convoy of waggons with food It was dark when we reached the river by Umbulwana and as it was danger ous and indeed impossible to cross the rift except in day light we outspanned by the river bank and made a pre tence of sleeping When yet it was dark on the following morning the mules were put in and with the earliest streak of dawn we crossed the river and made for Colenso The waggons were still toiling onwards towards Ladysmith The road as I have said was very rough and my poor cart which had served me well for three months began to show signs of giving out It broke down at last one of the wheels coming to pieces We were then some seven miles from Colenso and the vehicle was beyond all repair So it was left by the road side among other wreckage a forlorn relic of what was once a smart  bus Our very canty luggage was packed upon the mules backs our remaining food was distributed among the passersby and we pro ceeded to walk to Colenso The mules with my servant kept to the road but we walked along the railway There was a blazing sun and the walk was tedious The line took us through a district where fighting had been very heavy and we were all the way sickened by the hideous smell of numerous dead horses and of still more numerous dead and imperfectly buried Boers The hill sides and the very line presented the cases of countless shells here was a huge yellow hole in the ground due to our lyddite and there was a rail bent and contorted by a blow from a solid shell Cartridge cases heaps of ammunition empty meat tins strewed the way and on each side of the line were graves marked usually by a wooden cross where our gallant men were buried By good fortune a trolly came along and the men in charge of it kindly gave Miss McCaul a lift for the last five miles The line was however broken in so many places that the trolly did not reach Colenso railway bridge many minutes before we did At each break the trolly had to be lifted aoross From Colenso we travelled to Chieveley by a casual goods train sitting on the floor of an open truck as there was no guards van We reached Chieveley on Saturday at 1 pm very tired and very dirty Siege Rations I have made no mention of the life of the besieged at Ladysmith of their strange food of their remarkable messes of their numerous sick and of the way they spent their time All this will have been fully recorded in the daily papers We saw the lump of bread made from mealies and starch which constituted a ration and were willing to believe that an excellent blancmange was made out of starch and violet powder A Good Samaritan I may mention one incident of our Ladysmith journey which will serve to explain why the Kaffirs are attached to the English and very anxious for our success On returning from Ladysmith we bivouacked on Friday night near the drift as I have already mentioned The night was dark and just before we turned in a conductor The War In South AfricaAuthors Frederick Treves and William ThomsonSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2047 Mar 24 1900 pp 72673120264062 1153 16 mwSSJTHE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICAMarch4 iff THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA THE RETREAT FROM SPEARMANS HILL TO CHIEVELEY By Frederick Trves FRCS Consulting Surgeon with the Forces Chieveley Camp by Colenso February 23rd 1900 Septic Infection of Shell Wounds As I mentioned in my last letter we had great trouble at Spearmans Camp with the number of shell wounds They suppurated without exception and a few secondary amputations became necessary Moreover the septic changes were apt to spread to simpler wounds which would under ordinary conditions have healed without trouble We had ico coolie attendants with the hospital It was their duty to keep the camp clean to take away and bury all soiled dressings and to empty vessels contain ing discharges etc This work was well done but the difficulties of keeping a field hospital free from septic influences were increased by the great heat and the plague of flies Had we remained at Spearmans it would no doubt have been necessary to have changed the pitch of the camp The latrine arrangements were on the earth closet system with protected buckets and were quite perfect Retirement of Army On February 8 th the army began to retire and we were ordered to move all our wounded at daybreak on February 9th We had then about 150 cases in the hospital and all of them would be described as serious Indeed they were cases whose removal to the base had been delayed as long as possible All these patients had to travel a distance of 1 twentyfive miles in hot and dusty weather across the veld and along roads that could only be described as com paratively fair Hand Transport of Serious Cases It was here again that the value of the excellent system of stretcher bearers introduced by Colonel Gallwey PMO came so prominently forward The wounded were got ready before daybreak and at sunrise every man was on a stretcher and the army of stretcher bearers was at hand The whole of the 150 were carried by hand on stretchers from Spearmans to Frre a distance of twentyfive miles Each stretcher had a hood to protect the patient from the sun Food and drink and other necessaries were taken and the convoy was attended by a surgeon on horseback No more perfect way of carrying the wounded exists and we were pleased to hear that they all reached Frere with out mishap although one poor fellowwhose case was hopelessdied as soon as Frere was entered This is I think a triumph and the achievement would appeal to any who know what roads across the veld are like At Springfield the bearers had to ford a river which enters the Little Tugela Had the transport been made by ambulance waggons I am sure that both lives and limbs would have been lost and a terrible amount of suffering would have been occasioned An ambulance waggon is built to stand very rough work and any kind of road and ia at best a very uncomfortable vehicle for a long journey Some of the Cases Transported Among the patients who were carried down on the 9th were several cases of interest On February 3rd I had removed the  forequarter  clavicle scapula and upper limb for severe gunshot injury of the humrus and scapula I employed Paul Bergers method This man was among those who travelled to Frere and I am glad to hear that he had a comfortable journey and has since done very well On February 7th at 11 am I performed laparatomy for a gunshot wound of the abdomen involving the sigmoid flexure No drain was employed but the abdomen was well washed out This man undertook this journey of twentyfive miles across country on the morning of February 9ththat is within fortyeight hours of the operation He not only reached Frere with comfort but has since done well In civil practice it would be a little novel to let a patient take a long journey on the second day after a laparotomy General Woodgate whose case is assuming a little more favourable aspect and who was more at ease after I removed the damaged eye was among those who travelled down on the 9th He was accompanied by his brother who has nursed him with the utmost devotion since the day he was wounded The Return March of the Hospital As soon as one field hospital was empty we began our march to Chieveley with as before seventeen oxen waggons We reached Springfield at sundown and there bivouacked the nurses sleeping in ambulance wagons We left at dawn and bivouacked for the next night at Frere On February nth we reached Chieveley and enjoyed the luxury of once more having tents over our heads These marches were very tedious and trying owing largely to the freat heat the blinding sun and the dust Our stay at pearmans Camp had extended to 3 weeks and we had dealt withover 1000 one thousand wounded during that period The Sound of an Approaching Shell Before leaving Spearmans I had an experience of a shell which enabled me to appreciate the very marked dislike Tommy Atkins has to the sound of an approaching shell I and Captain Begbie RAMC had ridden out to visit one of the advanced field hospitalshospitals whose officers have the heaviest duties the greatest share of hardships I and I am afraid the least eredit for their splendid work This particular hospital had been shelled and had just come in to what they hoped was a more sheltered position under Zwarts Kop After a chat we left the hospital clambered through a donga and rode across a level green to the road As we reached the road we heard the exceed ingly unpleasant sound of an approaching shell from the Boers big gun This shell dropped on the green we had just cantered across and some 250 yards from where we had pulled up our horses The shell in question was un pleasantly near the hospital and a second shell that burst shortly after was nearer still and I am afraid our already tried friends had once more to move There is no doubt that the Boer fire was directed at some waggons and not actually at the hospital itself Three Months Campaigning I and my remaining nurse Miss McCaul have now been nearly three months at the front during which time we have been under canvas with the same field hospital We have moved as the headquarters camp has moved and have pitched our camp no fewer than six times namely twice at Frere twice at Chieveley once at Springfield and once at Spearmans As a comment upon the effect of camp life I may say that when we started at Frere at the beginning of December the personnel of the hospital con sisted of six individualsthree officers of the RAMC my two nurses and myself Out of the sis five of us have been laid up with dysentery Miss McCaul being the sole indi vidual to escape Of the five who were sick two only the commanding officer and myself managed to get well in camp The remaining three were seriously ill and were gradually removed to the base It thus happens that of the six who started only three are still with the hospital The hospital has since we started increased in size and the staff more than doubled by the appointment of a number of civil surgeons and of Netley sisters March 24 1900 THE BOBR AMBULANCE SYSTEM UEKa 77 The Consulting Surgeons and the RAMC I shall leave the hospital when the campaign ends with great regret Major Kirkpatrick has proved himself to be an ideal commanding officer He has shown us all the greatest kindness and consideration and has spared no pains to make No 4 the smartest and best hospital in the field We have borne the brunt of every engagement and the hospital has never failed My other colleagues the civil Burgeons were not only the most agreeable of companions but they were so keen and so efficient in their work that it was the greatest pleasure to cooperate with them Those who prophesied that all sorts of trouble and disagreement would arise between the army surgeons and the civil surgeons should know that no more harmonious body of men ever worked together than did those who constituted the star of  No 4 Miss McCaul and the Netley sisters worked without ceasing and many and many a wounded soldier will have reason never to forget the unstinted kindness and devotion of the sisters at No 4 The Girl He left behind Him In conclusion I am reminded of one little incident which may interest those who are interested in the Absent Minded Beggar Among the wounded brought in one day from Potgieters Drift was a man of scanty clothing who held something in his closed hand He had kept this treasure in his hand for some eight hours He showed it to the sister It was a ring In explanation he said  My girl gave me this ring and when I was hit I made up my mind the Boers should never get it so I have kept it in my hand ready to swallow it if I was taken before our stretchers could reach me THE BOER AMBULANCE SYSTEM From our Special Correspondent in Capetown February 28th 1900 The Hospital at Jacobsdal I am indebted to Dr T G Hall a graduate of the University of Durham who has been for some time District Surgeon of Jacobsdal for some interesting particulars about the Boer system of attendance on the wounded at that place which was the principal medical base for Cronjes force whilst barring the road to Kimberley At the outset of the war Dr Hall who I may mention is not a Free State burgher was appointed to work at this hos pital Jacobsdal is about a dozen miles from Modder River about twenty from Magersfontein about twentyfive from Gra8pan and about forty from Belmont The original hos pital there was the schoolhouse It consisted of three wards having about fifteen beds each an operating reception and administration room dispensary and offices To this were added from time to time three adjacent cottages each accom modating about ten patients The whole was under the charge of Dr Ramsbottom the Principal Medical Officer of the Free State forces with DrsBidwell andJHall as assistants These were aided from time to time by the various doctors attached to the commandos in the field For the last few weeks however Dr Hall was absolutely sin glehanded the other medical men having been withdrawn elsewhere The nursing staff at first consisted of the matron and two nurses from the Bloemfontein Hospital  later four other nurses from Bloemfontein and several Jacobsdal ladies were added There were several ambulance men recruited from various places but none of them had had any previous training although two were chemists One of the chemists was in charge of the rray apparatus The supply of instruments was good The fittings generally were fair and the beds were spring mat tresses sent from Bloemfontein and Pretoria The German Ambulance Just before the British occupation of Jacobsdal the whole place was taken over by the German ambulance which was splendidly equipped with the very latest appliances including its own oil engine and dynamo for the ray The staff of tiis ambulance consisted of three surgeons four nurses and five trained ambulance men besides a man in charge of the rray apparatus Operations were few No major amputa tions were performed Several fractures of the thigh and upper arm healed perfectly in two months One case of a compound smash just above the ankle was very notable The bone had been comminuted most extensively and the wound of exit was very large The patient was a man of the Lancers The wound healed perfectly It may be mentioned that the climate about this part of the country is dry and favourable in every way to aseptic surgery and to convalescence The Boer Commando System To understand the general working of th Boer system of medical aid one must look at the military system of the Republics The units are commandos from each district which act more or less independently of each other and maintain their own personnel in everything This organisation led to what is practically the old English regimental system of medical administration Outside the hospitals there was nothing that one could call a departmental organisation Each commando or part thereof when divided as was occasionally done in the case of large commandos had a doctor attached as long as themedical supply lasted which was in the case of the Free State longer than with the sister Republic owing to there being less prejudice against English surgeons Each of these doctors had four to eight ambulance men almost entirely without training employed mostly as dressers The bearers were generally Kaffirs A spring waggon was used for conveying wounded At Jacobsdal were three or four other spring waggons which were sent out from time to time to the battle fields The surgeon remained with his commando that is actually with the fighting line First aid was rendered to wounded men on the field and splints roughly applied but nothing of the nature of an operation was performed The wounded were then at once transported either to Jacobsdal or to Boshof or Koffyfontein where hospitals similar to those at Jacobsdal were established The surgeon of the commando usually accompanied his own wounded and remained at the hospital for some days This provided each hospital with a staff of floating assistants after each battle At Magers fontein which as your readers know was held for a long time there were a certain number of what might be called  field hospitals established in farmhouses when available in tents when they were not It will be seen from this sketch of the medical arrangements on the Western Borderand they appear to have been sub stantially the same elsewherethat the Boer organisation has been practically that of corps surgeons rendering first aid and stationary hospitals On the Natal side there has been prac tically a base hospital added at Pretoria and Johannesburg But no organised system of collection existed and nothing that could be called a field hospital as we understand it It is obvious that such a system although it may have answered fairly well with Boers defending certain positions at which they remained for long periods and from which they only re treated to points nearer their stationary hospitals must utterly break down with large numbers of wounded over a shifting area of country such as is the condition under which fighting is now going on in the Free State Even earlier it has begun to break down with the splitting up of the Boer force between the West Colesberg and the Eastern Frontier The amount of suffering which such a  system  would bring about if the Boers moved far away from their base and clear of a railway line is awful to contemplate But on the whole it seems to me that the Free State arrangements were better thought out than those of the sister Bepublic and more honestly adminis tered Management op Enteric Fever Curiously enough these temporary hospitals which I have called  field hospitals were principally used for medical cases some of the cases of enteric fever being treated there right through But as a rule the patients were sent to Jacobsdal where special enteric hospitals were extemporised out of the Dutch reformed and Kaffir churches They accom modated together about eighty patients and Dr Hall had charge of all these most of the time in addition to his other work Dr Hall tells me that enteric fever constituted the main part of the medical work dysentery being curiously enough conspicuous by its absence The dietetic treatment 73 vtSSJgZBASE HOSPITALS IN CAFE COLONYMaroh 14 1900 of typhoid fever presented much difficulty owing to the scarcity of milk Dr Hall tells me that he has had to make twentyfour bottles imperial pints go round sixty patients Maizena and various makeshifts had to be used to eke out this scanty supply Otherwise food was fairly plentiful j   The Boer Wounded Dr Hall does not feel justified in giving me any statistics about the actual numbers of Boer wounded but he took in at Jacobsdal most of the cases from Belmont and the succeeding battle The most fatal cases were head wounds Coinciding with our experience in Capetown he found that perforating wounds of the abdomen as well as those of the chest did almost uniformly well One unfortunate individual had a bullet wound right through the abdomen shell wounds above and below the left knee similar shell wounds above the left elbow and a fracture of the left radius and ulna He re covered most satisfactorily NOTES ON THE BASE HOSPITALS IN CAPE COLONY By Sir William Thomson Chief Surgeon IrishHospital South Africa Capetoum February 25th 1900  Accompanied by Lord Iveaghs son Hon Rupert Guinness I arrived here in the Norham Castle on Thursday last for ser vice with th Irish Hospital We were a day over the ships usual time for we had two bursts of heavy weather and our earlier hopes of a good run were thus disappointed Our last three days were unusually bad owing to a strong southeaster and a heavy head sea but we came in sight of Table Moun tain early on February 22nd and by 7 oclock we had heard of the relief of Kimberley Capetown has only one interest just now The subject of the war pervades ail conversation  the signs of it are present everywhere There is a crowd of transports in the bay in the streets khaki uniforms are many I have seen here our own men from home and the splendid soldiers whom New South Wales New Zealand Queensland and Ceylon have sent to help Some variety is lent to the monotonous khaki by the Indian syces who come in charge of horses from that country men made conspicuous by their brilliant turbansj some wearing medals some who will see war for the first time The Portland Hospital I was anxious to see some of the base hospitals here and oh February 23rd I spent some time at the Portland at Rondebosch I was fortunate enough to meet Mr Bowlby and some of his colleagues and also an old friend from Ireland Surgeon  Major Kilkelly of the Grenadier Guards Rondebosch is a suburb of Capetown and the site for the hospital is alongside that of No 3 General Hospital on a clear sandy ground about 100 feet above sea level There is a good water supply Pines grow round about very freely and the roads are pleasantly cool and otherwise excellent The hospital is very well equipped The operation tent is boarded and in the kitchen concrete has been laid down as flooring The cooking arrangements are very good There are several ranges but of course all this is only possible at the base The tents are of the tortoise pattern I found the men occupying excellent wirewoven beds and nothing was wanting to make their comfort and convalescence secure Some of the cases were of especial interest and I may mention a few of those J saw Perforating Wound of Upper Jaw and NecjcA Grenadier Guard was in the firing line lying prone as he took aim A Mauser bullet struck him in the right eye passed downwards and to the left through the soft palate continued its course through the floor of the mouth emerged from the neck at the anterior edge of the sternomastoid and again entering above the clavicle smashed that bone That happened at Magersf ontein Today all the wounds are healed There is not any indication of a scar about the eyelids The bullet went in without touching either The man suffers from huskiness and Mr Bowlby told me there was some laryngeal paralysis but the patient is otherwise perfectly well  Multiple Bullet WoundsNear him lay a man belonging I think to the Warwickshire regiment A lieutenant and six men tried to storm a kopje but it proved too great an undertaking and they had to retire Xfie patient was struck at the outer edge of the left scapula The bullet  emerged in front 2 inches above the nipple He fell and was imme diately attacked by a Boer who emptied the remainder of his magazine at him One bullet entered above the left anterior superior spinona pro cess and coursed backwards through the muscles and another went through the soft part of his left leg This man was quite well except that fre had some mood in the left thorax The wounds all ran an aseptic course   Bullet Wound of Brain  Trephining  RecoveryA young soldier was lying in bed looking as if nothing was the matter with him He had been trephined five days before When admitted he had a bullet wound in the vertex He was partially insensible but had no localising symptoms His temperature then was 102  The operation disclosed several frag ments of bone embedded in the brain and also part of the nickel cover ing of the bullet He was quite free from fever or other symptoms and he told me he felt all right Bullet Woundiof TarsusI saw another lad with an interesting injury  A bullet entered at the tip of the inner malleolus passed slightly obliquely outwards and upwards traversed the astragalus and made its exit through the centre of the outer malleolus The wounds were quite healed All that remained were two scars of the area of the end of a lead pencil The motion of the joint was all right and there was no effusion of any kind to indicate a recent injury There had been four cases of fractured femur from bullet wounds There was much bone splintering but all had done well Mr Bowlby bore high testimony to the management of these cases at the front All came down most carefully dressed  an aseptic case was rarely eeen The Base Hospitals at Wynbebg On February 24th I went to Wynberg where I was glad to meet an old fellowstudent LieutenantColonel Greer B AMC one of the officers in charge Later on Mr Makins the Civilian Consulting Surgeon joined us and gave me much pleasure in the narration of the work being done at this great base hospital The name of Wynberg is so well known at home that it is unnecessary to do more than say it is eight miles from Cape town and is normally the military camp The range of large commodious huts have all been converted into hospital wards and there is accommodation for 600 patients The air is clear and cool and there is a pleasant surrounding shade of pine trees through which here and there views of the sea can be had There were not many serious cases in when I visited There were two or three fractures of the femur which were getting well slowly but Mr Makins believed the result would be good In these and other cases where there had been much destruction there was considerable suppuration following necrosis but the amount of shortening was very slight and in some cases there was none Bullet Wound of Shoulder JointAn officer whom I saw had his left humrus divided through the surgical neck by a splinter of shell There was of course a considerable wound Mr Makins determined to try to save the arm union of bone had taken place and it is probable that there will ultimately be a useful arm Nearly all the spinal cases have done badly I was interested to visit the Boer prisoners They were a fine lot of men and those of them who were out of bed were in high good spirits I chatted with several of them about their injuries I found that many of them belonged to European nationalities and that the pure Boer was only a per centage These however all spoke English just as one hears it at home Perforating LeeMetford Bullet Wound of ChestOne man a Dane told me he was wounded at Magersfontein on December nth He was one of the Scandinavian picket and he said that twothirds of them were killed He had a remarkable wound The bullet entered just below the apex of the heart and passing through the thorax came out at the eighth inter space on the right side in the midaxillary line He was out of bed all the wounds were quite healed and he appeared to be in good health Case of SnakebiteOne boy aged 17 told me he was in hospital for snakebite I learned that there had been much cellulitis of the hand and forearm but he was recovering He was taken at Elandslaagte He said his father was in the Town Guard at Kimberley Here was an in stance of father and son fighting on opposite sides The prisoners occupied the same class of ward as our own men and were treated in precisely the same way They had comfortable wirewoven mattresses mosquito curtains etc and the only indication that they were prisoners was the presence of a sentry outside the door All the wards were large airy well lighted and well ven tilatpd So far as such comforts go nothing could have been better Aseptic Wounds One of the facts which have been established thus far is the marvellous success which has followed the effort to keep wounds aseptic It must always be remembered that the first dressings are made under the greatest disadvantages The War In South AfricaSource The British Medical

Occasional Correspondent Bloemfontein July 7th 1900 The attack which has recently been made on the medical arrangements in Bloemfontein has been as unexpected as it has been wholly unmerited From the telegrams which have been published here it would appear that Mr BurdettCoutts visited the town shortly after its occupation At this time railway communication with the Orange River Colony was almost cut off by the destruction of several bridges across the Orange River Every available train and every possible waggon was required to hurry provisions to the front The rationing of the troops being of even greater importance than the equipment of the hospitals the military authorities rightly decreed that it should take precedence of every other consideration When Mr BurdettCoutts visited the town therefore he found the hospitals insufficiently equipped Heedless of the difficulties which beset the medical authori ties and unmindful of the excellent work which the RAMC had already dono during the campaign he forthwith proceeded to frame highlycoloured and sensational charges against the Corps He appears to have admitted that in framing these charges he was comparing the condition of the hospitals in Bloemfontein with that of hospitals in London with which he was acquainted Could anything have been more unreason able  If we try to picture to ourselves the condition of even a fullyequipped London hospital into which 500 bad accidents had been admitted in a day we may form some idea of the difficulties which the RAMC have had to face in South Africa Yet this is what has happened many times during the present campaign  whilst on occasions nearly double that number of sick and wounded have had to be accommodated in a single day and this whilst some at least of the hospitals were still in the process of equipment That the RAMC have met and successfully dealt with such emergencies as these entitles them to the thanks most certainly not to the censure of the nation I venture to say that no one could have been more keenly alive to the temporary shortcomings of the hospitals in Bloemfontein than were the officers of the RAMC They were however powerlesstied hand and foot by the exigencies of the situation Were Mr BurdettCoutts to visit the town atthe present moment however he would give a very different account of the hospital management As soon as the more urgent de mands on the railway traffic would admit hospital equipment was hurried up from the base In addition to those which are housed in permanent buildings there are now seven hospitals under canvas in the neighbourhood of the town For many weeks past all the hospitals have been fully equipped with spring and trestle beds and with all the other requisites which are necessary for the comfort of the sick So far there fore as Bloemfontein is concerned the sick and wounded are as well and comfortably cared for as they would be in any station hospital in England and I have reason to believe that the same remark applies to hospitals further up the line I have frequently visited patients who are being treated under canvas and one and all express satisfaction with the arrange ments which have been made for their comfort Indeed many of them state that they would prefer to be treated in tents as these are brighter fresher and better ventilated than most of the public buildings in Bloemfontein All the cases under canvas which are in any way seriously ill are accommodated in large marquees which are provided with double roofs and flies The tents are bright and warm and the supply of blankets and underclothing is ample so that not one of the patients complaiued of cold Indeed there is a general consensus of opinion amongst the medical officers that enteric fever patients do better in tents than in per manent buildings and it is not difficult to understand why this should be so When the weather is bright and warm as it usually is during the day time at this season of the year the flies of the tent can be raised and a current of pure fresh air admitted which is both grateful and beneficial to the patients As for the dieting of the sick the arrangements are all that could be desired Each hospital is fitted up with stoves and all necessary cooking utensils There is an abundant supply of excellent fresh meat fowls turkfys fish eggs butter milk delicious bread etc The supply of medical comforts is as ample as could be desired and includes champagne brandy wines bovril Liebigs extract Brands essence tinned and malted milk and many other articles As far as I have seenand I have had many opportunities of judging the dieting and treatment of the sick in Bloemfontein are quite satisfactory A further charge has been brought against the RAMC by Mrs Richard Chamberlain namely that the officers oppose the distribution of comforts to patients This is an even more invidious attack than that of Mr BurdettCoutts for it is calculated to arouse the resentment of every lady in England or at least of all those who have relatives and friends serving in South Africa or who have contributed towards the funds of the Society An interesting point about these attacks is that they were published almost simul taneously Is it possible that there can have been concerted action  It has certainly not been my experience that medical officers throw any difficulties in the way of the distribution of suitable and necessary comforts to the sick Indeed I have found them not only willing but anxious to avail themselves of these and officers from each of the hospitals pay almost daily visits to the Red Cross Society There can be no doubt however that articles which are entirely unsuitable are often times given to patients in hospital I am aware of instances in which bags of biscuits have been handed by visitors to men who were in the third week of enteric fever and this mistaken kindness has actually led to the death of the patients from perforation Can we wonder then if medical officers throw difficulties in the way of indiscriminate distri bution of articles of diet to men in hospital  Some at least of the articles which are sent to hospitals would be injurious even to men in perfect health  how much more then to men who are convalescing from say a dangerous attack of enteric fever  Again in other cases men in hospital have been found with perhaps a dozen cardigan jackets or an even larger number of shirts  whilst in one instance that I know of a man was found in possession of 29 of these useful articles which had been given him at different times by kind but not over judicious visitors Patients have even been known to exchange articles of clothing surreptitiously for liquor in these cases generally of the worst quality Again is it sur prising if medical officers occasionally throw difficult s in the way of visitors  Bloemfontein is practically devoid of modern sanitary improvements Enteric fever is endemic in the town from 300 to 400 cases occurring annually amongst the permanent civil population Under ordinary circumstances there is a good and abundant supply of water derived from the town waterworks Shortly after our occupation this was cut off by the Boers and a considerable interval elapsed before it could be reestablished During this time the large force which was encamped round the town had perforce to fall back on shallow well and surface vrater As the surrounding district is destitute of trees cr of wood of any kind it was difficult to obtain sufficient fuel even to cook the mens rations It was therefore quite impossible to boil the drinking water It was even impossible to filter it for during Lord Robertss historic march most of the Berkefeld filters had been accidentally broken THE HOSPITALS AT CAPETOWN From our Special Correspondent at Capetown July 11th 1900 Green Point Camp Hospital The Green Point Camp Hospital like its bigger sister at Wood stock has grown gradually from very small dimensions to the size of a general hospital although it is not as yet graded or staffed as such This process of gradual development con ducted under the strain of active service conditions is perhaps Aug h 1900THE HOSPITALS AT CAPETOWNLmSLSSil 39 the most severe of all tests of the administrative ability of the Medical Department and in this case it is the more instruc tive from the fact that one officer Major Trevor RAMC has been at the head of affairs from the beginning Judging by what I have seen on a recent visit neither the Principal Medical Officer nor the Department can be accused of failure The hospital is in my opinion all that can be reasonably ex pected as an agency for securing the wellbeing of the patients At the commencement of hostilities when it was decided to establish a camp on Green Point Common an ordinary camp hospital was of course part of the establishment This was 4  nondieted the men simply drawing the ordinary soldiers ration supplemented by such extras as the medical officers might consider it necessary to order and it was only intended for the reception of cases of slight and temporary illness All affections of at all a serious nature were transferred to Wood stock Later partly because of the large increase in the work at the camp partly because of the great pressure on Wood stock the Green Point Hospital was largely extended in its scope and by arrangement with the Corporation of Capetown the Infectious Diseases Hospital then just completed was taken into it It became partially dieted and did and is still doing the full work of a station hospital treating practically all the sick from its own camp a certain pro portion of sick landed from the transports and at times convalescents from upcountry In addition to this owing to the establishment of a camp for the Boer prisoners on the common the sick from this place have been added to the patients The position of the hospital is convenient and except for the drawback of a dusty atmosphere not specially evident in winter fairly salubrious although not of course to be compared with Wyn berg and Rondebosch Green Point and Seapoint the latter being a prolongation of the former are the northern suburbs of Capetown occupying a gradually narrowing belt of land fringing the peninsula between the sea and the foothills of the  Lion They are the only marine suburbs those in the Wynberg direction skirting the base of Table Mountain at some distance from the ocean At Green Point the belt of land is still fairly wide and is mainly occupied by a large common used as an open recreation ground part of which is fenced in as an athletic and cycle track This latter portion is now used for the Boer prisoners The whole locality is practically a portion of Capetown and is easily reached by an excellent tram service The hospital is situated just within the city or southern boundary of the common with the New Somerset Hospital between it and the sea the Beer pri soners enclosure intervening between it and the main road whilst the camp proper stretches away to the north Its con venience with reference to supplies is obvious whilst its proximity to the New Somerset Hospital has frequently proved of service enabling the two institutions to render mutual assistance in many ways The two staffs have cooperated most happily The medical officers of the Green Point Hos pital perform the ordinary camp medical duties including at tendance on those officers and noncommissioned officers who live out of quarters No 5 General Hospital it may be men tioned performs the like duties for the garrison at the Castle and the main barracks having one medical officer permanently detailed for the purpose The permanent part of the hospitalthat is the municipal infectious hospitalconsists of three blocks one facing the street and two at right angles The first of these intended for an administrative block is occupied as wards The only disadvantage is that the rooms being small a large amount of extra trouble in nursing and supervision is neces sitated The building is a very fine twostoreyed one excel lently built splendidly ventilated and fitted with every necessary appliance The kitchen and annexes are connected with it and are perfect in their arrangements Indeed so far as the permanent buildings are concerned the Green Point Hospital is probably the best in South Africa as the infectious hospital was designed in accordance with the latest ideas of hospital construction Enteric patients who consti tute here as elsewhere the majority of the acute cases have been placed in the original wards They are lofty airy cheerful and newlooking The latrines are fitted with Shanks arrangement for the mechanical cleaning of bed pans A third small block is used as nurses quarters The remainder of the accommodation consists of well built iron huts wood lined with a few tents The Principal Medical Officers office is a small and inconvenient hut at the camp end of the building One of the huts deserves special notice as it was presented by British actors and actresses and bears a notification to that effect It is used as an enteric ward and contains 26 beds The Boer prisoners have a block of huts to themselves They are extremely comfortable andadmit it One of them a field cornet speaking in the mellifluous taal was quite profuse in his appreciation of the good treatment he had met with and told me that although he was most anxious to get out on parole  it was only because he was now convalescent and did not need any more attention One at least of the nurses a South African lady I noticed to speak Dutch The personnel consists of Major Trevor RAMC in charge  Captain Douglas RAMC and 5 civil surgeons one of them a retired Volunteer surgeonmajor There are 12 nurses and 23 orderlies with a sergeantmajor Only 4 of the orderlies are RAMC men When I paid my visit there were 190 soldier patients and 48 Boers The total accommodation is 380 for the former and 72 for the latter thus very closely approaching the regulation dimensions of a general hospital Next to enteric fever dysentery bulks most largely and there are a few cases of pneumonia Here as elsewhere treatment by magnesium sulphate appears to be the favourite method for dysentery On a general survey of the whole place made just prior to Mrs Dick Chamberlains letter appeared I can only say that any allegations made as to lack of comfort or want of cleanliness at Green Point were then certainly unfounded My visit was entirely a surprise one and I came away con vinced that so far as these essentials were concerned the patients in this hospital were as well off as in any civil hospital in South Africa better than in most whilst private inquiries made from several patients lately discharged have failed to elicit any tangible complaints on other points The Hospital for Boer Prisoners at Simonstown The special point about this hospital for sick Boer prisoners is that it is the only one which has been entirely worked under civil surgeons Even the outside hospitals such as the Portland and the Yeomanry albeit their professional staff was civil have been administered by RAMC commandants The Palace was organised by a civil surgeon PMO Dr Carr who remained in charge ever since and of course his junior medical officers have all been civil surgeons When the first batches of prisoners were interned on ships in the Bay a very lamentable amount of sickness mostly enteric appeared amongst them and it became evident that their removal to a proper hospital on shore was desirable although undoubtedly the original source of the trouble was not in tne ships Under these circumstances the Base PMO with his usual promptitude in grasping a situation got hold of the 11 Palace an old building which was at the time occupied as barracks by the Cape Garrison Artillery and had been I believe originally built for a hotel Dr Cane at the time one o the staff of No 1 General was put in charge and given as free a hand in the way of organisation as was compatible with a very elementary conformity to military medical regu lations He has succeeded remarkably well in spite of many obstacles He has had no quartermaster and no steward and until lately not even a noncommissioned officer His present sergeant is a man promoted from the ranks of the Cape Volun teer Medical Staff Corps Consequently he or Dr T G Hall his only remaining junior officer do all the work of making up diet summaries accounting for stores and the like and they may be seen at any time turning from professional work to unlock the store and give out so many pounds of butter or so many ounces of nort wine The PMO has never had even a clerk from the RAMC a Boer prisoner on parole who had been I think an attorney in Johannesburg performing the duties To carry on things smoothly must have been a difficult task but it appears to have been accomplished At one time four civil surgeons were on the staff besides Dr Cari but now only one remains Dr T G Hall formerly District Surgeon of jacobsdal who as I mentioned in one of my previous letters bad been working the Jacobsdal Hospital for the Boer sick He is a most valuable man understanding the Boer character and speaking the taal fluently 37Q MwiSSjTHE PLAGUEAug n 1900 There were originally 12 nurses none of the Army Nursing Service and two only from the reserve The remainder were outsiders and the majority untrained One of these was the late Miss Kingsley of whose ability and devotion to the sick Dr Carr speaks in the highest terms Several of the volunteer nurses were local Dutch ladies There are only 6 nurses now The male staff consists of about 30 none of them RAMC some are Cape VMSC some St Johns some line orderlies and some civilians Very few speak Dutch but this is not of much importance owing to the fact that a large number of the prisoners are members of other nationalities and generally peak English There are now only 40 patients in the hospital  there have been as many as 136 The majority of cases are enteric fever with a few cases of dysentery and pneumonia and very little else On the whole I think that the Boer is a worse patient for a disease like enteric than the British soldier owing to his peculiar liability to nervous complications He is very prone to get a low form of delirium with failing cardiac action to which he often succumbs Dr Hall showed me two oases in which pure dementia had been left on convalescence Many of the cases also showed signs and symptoms apparently those of a general neuritis in the third and fourth weeks It has been noticed here as elsewhere that many cases of enteric keep up a fairly uniform temperature during the third and fourth weeks not ranging very high perhaps not above 1010 or 102o with very slight morning remissions and in these cases one learns to form a very bad prognosis  complica tions develop or a relapse supervenes and in either case the patient dies The hospital consists o a main building and four large huts but none of the latter are at present in use for patients They are constructed after the same pattern as those at Woodstock and are roomy well ventilated and comfortable The main building consists of a number of small wards mostly holding 8 or 10 beds and many open into each other They have whitewashed walls and consequently look somewhat unfinished but all are scrupulously clean and they have never been overcrowded Every comfort is pro vided and friends have free access to the patients perhaps too much so as they not infrequently abuse the privilege by conveying forbidden articles of food Besides the official supplies which are liberal to a degree plenty of clothing tobacco pipes and other comforts are freely supplied by local sympathisers and every deference is paid to their idiosyncrasies by relaxing in a large measure the discipline of military hospitals properly so called This hospital is a standing proof of one thing at least that the authorities who can boldly entrust the entire task of organisation and administration to a civilian staff are not so iiidebound by tradition as some critics assert whilst the fact of its being so great a success shows not only the ability of Dr Carr but that he must have had the cordial support of his chief the Base PMO in his arduous task Inspection by General Commanding Lines of Communication The campaign of criticism against the medical administra tion is visibly slackening in view of the failure of the critics to bring up tangible facts The General Commanding the Lines of Communication has just completed a tour of inspection of all the hospitals on the lines and has authorised the publication of a general order expressing his entire satisfaction with the way in which the sick and wounded are cared for DINNER TO WAR SURGEONS AT DURBAN On June 30th the medical practitioners of Durban enter tained Sir William Stokes Consulting Surgeon to the Field Forces and Sir Thomas Fitzgerald of Melbourne at dinner in the Durban Club The Rev Dr Booth was also among the honoured guests There was a large attendance of members and Dr Addison presided In the speeches which followed appreciative remarks were made by the Chairman and Dr Allen on the services rendered by the guests during the pre sent war Special reference was made by Sir William Stokes to the unjustifiable and in many instances grotesque charges that had recently been made against the Army Medical Ser vice He paid a high tribute of praise to the superb way the medical and surgical work had been accomplished in the pre sent campaign by the army medical officers both in the field and base hospitals which undoubtedly had far distanced any similar work done in former wars Sir Thomas Fitzgerald whose health was proposed by Dr Allen in a felicitous speech fully endorsed all that had fallen from Sir William Stokes and thanked the proposer not only for his kind references to himself but also for what he had said of the splendid achieve ments of the Australian forces that had come forward so loyally and promptly in defence of their Queen and mother country The Rev Dr Booth and Major McCormick RAMC also spoke effectively To the toast of The Chairman proposed by Sir William Stokes Dr Addision re plied in suitable and eloquent terms The entertainment was diversified by music and some excellent and humorous anec dotes connected with his Colonial experiences were con tributed by Dr Damas THE PLAGUE Prevalence of the Disease India In Bombay during each of the two consecutive weeks ending July 12th and 19th respectively 60 persons died of plague Six to eight deaths daily is the record of plague mortality at the present moment The number of deaths occurring under the heading  diseases of the respiratory system  has increased lately in Bombay and as these have in the past been looked on with suspicion as pneumonic plague may be incorporated in the return it may be concealment or ignorance is partly accountable for the favourable plague returns In Calcutta during the week endin July 17th there were 56 cases of plague and 53 deaths from the disease a great falling off compared with the two previous weeks From the report of Captain J K Condon Indian Staff Corps on plague the mortality from plague can be fairly well estimated Up to the present moment some 300000 persons have died of plague in the Bombay Presidency since the disease first appeared in Bombay in September 1896 Australia New South WalesOn July 21st there remained in the plague hospital 49 cases of plague  during the subsequent week no fresh cases were admitted Of the 49 who were in hospital between July 218t and July 28th 14 were discharged recovered and 1 died leaving 34 in hospital on July 28th Since the outbreak in Sydney 302 cases in all have ben treated  of these 102 died The mortality amongst the Chinese attacked by plague is out of all proportion to the deathrate amongst Europeans as of 10 Chinamen attacked 8 died Mauritius During the month ending August 2nd 10 cases of plague occurred in Mauritius all the cases proving fatal Suspected Plague at Hamburg The ss Rosario is lying at the quarantine station at Hamburg under medical supervision The cause of the detention is that one of the crew was found to be suffering from symptoms suspiciously like plague The steamer was carrying coal from Cardiff to Hamburg The patient is progressing satisfactorily and the rest of the crew continue well The Identification of Blood of IndividualsDr W Birchmore has satisfied himself that he has discovered a method of identifying the blood of individual members of the human race In the Neio York Medical Journal of July 7th he gives the details of the apparatus and methods which he has used for some time in making thousands of bloodcounts and he has come to the conclusion that he can without hesitation swear to the fact that two specimens are not those of the same person and can with considerable certainty say that the blood of one stain is the same as that of some other presented The sources of error are many for the discrepancies in the best of eyepiece micrometers are oftentimes very great The personal equation must also be fully considered The author believes however that by making a large number of blood counts and plotting the results into curves opinions of con siderable legal value can be given Presentation to Db Alan HerbertAt the Hertford British Hospital Paris on August 4th the Honourable Alan Herbert physician to the hospital was presented with an illuminated address by Dr J F

suddenly received to increase the hospital by ioo bell tents which meant being ready for 500 more patients or F ig 3Tile operatiug tlheatro of No 4 Fielcd tLoapital caoWwug Ljiic operating table

The tents were ready however by the next day and on January 25th the wounded began to pour in until late at night carried by the Volunteer Ambulance Corps organised by Colonel Galwey and the coolie bearers Some 300 wounded were at once sent on the 25 miles to Frere but the hospital that night contained some 6cc others Additionis later brought up the total which the hospital bad to

over i ooo wounded in that time The army began to retire on Februatry 8th and when on the next day the order came to the hospital to move there were still about 150 serious cases undter treatment These were all carried by hand on stretchers acrosis the veld 25 miles to the railway at Frere By transporting the woudnded in this way instead of in the ambulance waggons which are of a clumsy pattern made strong to go anywhere much suffering was prevented and in Mr Trevess opinion many lives and limbs saved At Frere wlhich was reached on February i ith the wounded were again placed in the hospital and as soon as possible moved on by train to Mooi River Base Hospital or to the hospital ships at Durban These trains were improvised by Major BrazierCreagh RAMC who did wonders with the material at his disposal Unfortunately the carriages had no through communication and it was difficult to arrange their conversion However by hard work and the expenditure of much energy and ingenuity Major BrazierCreagh overcame all superable obstacles and made the best of insuperable defects Fig 2 iS from Mr Trevess photograph of one of these trains and shows the bearers at work getting the wounded into the carriages Through the windows the white bed linen of the upper tier of beds can be seen It was part of the general unpreparedness that there were no hospital trains in Natal This defect has recently been repaired by the arrival of the Princess Christian Hospital train built for the Red Cross at Birmingbam and despatched to South Africa after the battle of Colenso was foughtnot a conspicuous example of the alleged superiority of voluntary effort over official methods The War Office has no train ready and does not prepare one the Red Cross has no train built but does set to work to build one one for three armies resting on three different lines of railway and man ages to get to work six months or thereabouts after the be ginning of the fighting WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE FROM AN OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT THE FIGHT INTO LADYSMITH To appreciate fully the magnitude of the task accomplished by the troops under Sir Redvers Buller one must bave seen the district around Colenso Opposite this village the Tugela is a broad and rapid river with steep and rugged banks which changes its course continually For months past it has been unfordable and the only bridges crossing it had been destroyed by the Boers On either side of the river are irregular ranges of hills which are divided by deep ravines into innumerable kopjes of every conceivable shape These vary in height from soo tO 2000 feet above the surrounding plain Many of them are almost perpendicular and most of them are thickly covered by dense mimosa scrub and huge boulders so that an army corps could be hidden amongst them without a man being visible Each kopje bristled with strong and deep trenches so skilfully constructed that as each one was captured it was exposed to a withering fire from all sides To add to our difficulties the plain between Colenso and Ladysmith is studded with kopjes which completely com mand both the road and the railway The seeming impossi bility of the task might well have caused even the bravest troops to hesitate and it was only after four stubborn attacks which extended over a period of 28 days hard fighting that the position was finally carried The strain which this entailed on our troops can only be realised by those who were present Imagine an attack which lasted continuously for x7 days as did the final one on the Boer position During the whole of that time the troops slept on the hillsides amidst thunder storms and rain with not even a great coat to cover them No words can do justice to their courage heroism fortitude and cheerfulness under all the hardships and privations to which they were exposed Ladysmith the goal of all our hopes during so many long and weary days may be described as a town in corrugated zinc situated in an oasis of palms and eucalyptus trees Stretching away to eastward of the town is a large circular plain some six miles in diameter On the southeast margin of theplainrises UmbulwanaHill Exceptto eastwardthetown is surrounded by barren stoneclad hills prominent amongst them being the famous Wagon Hill with Casars Camp to the south Whilst wandering through Ladysmith one is forcibly struck by its wonderful state of preservation An angle knocked off the clock tower of the Town Hall another off the porch of the Roman Catholic chapel and an occasional circular hole through some stray house is all that remains to 9I6 TMuRBl JO WITH THE SOUTH NATAL FIELD FORCE tell of the fierce and longcontinued siege and bombardment which it so successfully resisted Amongst the troops and i9habitants however languid movements and pale and haggard faces showed clearly the effect of restricted rations and days and nights of broken rest Considering the number of men and animals that were shut up in the town for four long months its sanitary condition is marvellous Noxious smells are absent and our entrance intoLadysmithwas attended by an almost complete relief from the swarms of flies which plagued us at Colenso The health of the garrison has naturally suffered much At the time of the relief there were considerably over 2000 sick and wounded in hospital 8oo it was said were suffering from en teric fever It is currently rumoured that the Principal Medical Officer Colonel T J Gallwey CB is making arrangements to send as manyof the Ladysmith sick as possible to Durban where they will be placed on board hospital ships and sent for a sea voyage MIEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS As the relief column advanced against the hills south of the Tugela the field hospitals were steadily pushed forward from Chieveley until they rested on the south slopes of Monte Cristo and Hlangwana Hills On February 21st the 5th Irish Brigade captured Colenso The same evening the brigade crossed the Tugela and occupied the hills around Fort Wylie On February 22nd four field hospitals were moved across the pontoon bridge which had just been constructed and encamped on a large plain east of Fort Wylie on the north side of the river Whilst in this position the hospitals were vigorously shelled by the Boers especially those under LieutenantColonel G T Gaggin Major N R Cree and Major G H Younge As the troops worked round the Boer left flank it was found impossible to send the wounded back in the direction of Fort Wylie as the greater part of the road was exposed to the eaemys fire The hospitals were therefore ordered to recross the Tugela and to advance along its south bank in the direc tion of Ladysmith The evacuation of the field hospitals is unfortunately be c6ming increasingly difficult owing to the hospitals at the base and on the lines of communication being blocked with sick and wounded THE RED CROSS Namerous complaints have from time to time appeared as to the Boera failing to recognise the Red Cross For instance the field hospitals were repeatedly shelled at Spion Kop at Vaal Krantz and again at Fort Wylie I do not believe for a moment however that this was done intentionally It must be remembered that the Boer guns were firing at ranges varying from 6 to 8 miles or even more and at these distances it would be manifestly impossible to see the Red Cross flag The hospital tents being the most conspicuous objects in the field naturally attracted the enemys fire In fditure campaigns however it would be well if all tents and ambulances were khakicoloured These would be practically invisible at long ranges and would in every way be a very great improvement on the present lightcoloured tents and amibulances LYDDITE During the actions around Colenso we had many oppor tunities of studying the effects of lyddite amongst Boer pri sonerswho were broughtin wounded Some of the wounds were quite ghastly In one prisoner admitted into the 5th Brigade Field Hospital a fragment of shell had carried away the upper part of the sternum several of the upper ribs and the greater part of the adjoining shoulder leaving the lung exposed to view Part of the same shell had smashed the right femur and opened the kneejoint The patient was however progressing favourably when he left for the base The exposed parts of the skin of many of the prisoners was stained of a bright yellow colour by the lyddite fumes and washing had no apparent effect on the discoloration DRY ANTISEPTIc DRESSINGS The dislike not to say suspicion which both officers aid men entertain towards dry antiseptic dressings is very ramarkable This arises in part from a desire to have the wounds exposed daily so that they may see how they are progressing and in part from an inability to understand the advantages of antiseptic surgery Wounded men will adopt almost any device such for instance as deliberately soiling the bandages to ensure a change of dressing If the dressings are not changed daily many of them believe that they are being grossly neglected The advantages of dry antiseptic dressings have however been clearly demonstrated during the presentcampaign and it is certainly time that the army generally grasped the prin ciple which underlies them BOER AMMUNITION At the battle of Colenso the bullet wounds were without exception caused by ordinary Mauser bullets Not a wound was seen which even remotely suggested an expanding bullet At Spion Kop however several of the woundb showed that expanding bullets had been used When the Boer position at Monte Cristo was captured quantities of their ammunition fell into our hands Amongst this were found MartiniHenry Mannlicher sporting LeeMetford sporting soft nosed and Jeffreys sporting cartridges The latter are especially destruc tive The tip of the envelope is removed and the nickel coating is scored longitudinally at four points When it strikes a part of the bullet breaks and fattens out like a mushroom inflicting a truly ghastly wound NUMBERING OF FIELD HOSPITALS Before leaving England the field hospitals were numbered cousecutively from No I upwards without any reference to the brigade to which they belonged On taking the field it was found that this gave rise to constant mistakes and incon veniences Finally the number of the hospital was changed to correspond with that of the brigade to which it belonged as for instance the ist Brigade Field Hospitala change which greatly simplified matters This system should certainly be adopted in future campaigns as under it the number of the hospital at once denotes the brigade to which it belongs During the attack on Pieters Hill it was rumoured that Captain J H Campbell RAMC attached to the Kings Royal Rifles had been reoommended for the Victoria Cross Captain Oampbell was informed that some men of the regi ment lay wounded on a kopje about 400 yards away He walked to the kopje through a fire which was so fierce that he was almost hidden by the dust which was raised by the bullets Strange to say he escaped without a scratch but was wounded a day or two later whilst on duty with the regiment CHARGES AGAINST HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT Since writing the above I have learnt from the BRITISH MEDICAL JouRNAL of February ioth that certain charges of defective management have been brought against some at least of the hospitals in South Africa These charges have been officially contradicted by both Lord Roberts and Sir Redvers Buller How easily charges of this kind may origi nate is shown by an incident which occurred after the battle of Colenso Two wounded men complained to their commanding officer whilst he was visiting the hospital that they had had nothing to eat for two days On inquiry it turned out that both the men were severely wounded and were for good reasons only allowed fluid nourishment An ample supply of milk and beeftea had been ordered for them and they ad mitted that they had received the whole of it As however they had not had solid food they complained that they had had nothing to eat THE PASTEUR INSTITUTE OF ALGIERsThe Annales de llnstitut Pasteur of March 2Sth contains a report

lately Consulting Surgeon with the Field Force Natal gave an address on this subject After expressing his sense of the honour done him in asking him to give such an address he said  Modern Rifles I may in the first place drawattention to the weapons that are being used in this particular campaign especially the Mauser and the LeeMet ford rifles It is a somewhat extraordinary thing that the development of the rifle as an instrument for carrying the missile long distances with a flat trajectory does not quite coincide with its destructive powers because although the rifle may be said to be an enormous improve ment upon the MartiniHenry still I suppose that in war the purpose of the rifle is to destroy or disable as many men as possible and as completely as possible And if that really be considered to be the test of a good rifle then the rifles used in the present campaign cannot be considered as good perhaps as the oldfashioned weapon I might perhaps be allowed to mention one or two facts about this weapon The Rifling The purpose of rifling is to give rotation to the ball in its long axis Unless that be done the ball as a projectile if it 4e a conical ball is practically futile A cylindrical bullet of which I show you an example Fig 6 coming from a smooth bore rifle would begin to rotate on its short axis immediately it left the muzzle and even at the distance of a few yards would strike a target on the flat  therefore as a projectile it would be useless A Martini rifle has one complete turn of the barrel in 22 inches the LeeMetford actually doubles that and makes one complete turn in 10 inches The Mauser makes one complete turn in 8 inches so that as far as velocity in the rotation of the bullet at the muzzle is concerned the Mauser is by far the superior weapon The great object in all four rifles is to get a flat trajectory that means much greater accuracy in shooting in regard to the sighting of the rifle Much harder hitting is secured because it is a cleaner hit and of course a very greatly increased danger zone especially with regard to cavalry The bullet of a Snider sighted to 2 000 yards will have to rise 310 less than 866 feet above the line of shot the Martini Henry sighted for 2000 yards will have to rise 357 feet which means an enormous zone where a man might walk about at his ease without the least possibility of being hit between the rifle and the target The LeeMetford has the same range but only rises the short distance of 1Q4 feet and conse quently the trajectory is very nearly flat The muzzle velocity of the MartiniHenry was only 1350 feet per second  the muzzle velocity of the LeeMetford is 2000 feet per second and the muzzle velocity of the Mauser 2300 feet per second Ihe Bullet With regard to the shape of the bullet this bullet of a LeeMet ford Fig 3 is supposed to represent the acme of perfection in the shape of a bullet In a very admirable book published by the War Office authorities as a Textbook for Military Small Arms it is stated that the power of a bullet to overcome resistance must be directly proportional to its weight and inversely proportional to its cross section It comes to pass therefore that an elongated trajee tile such as the Mauser or the LeeMet ford bullet has an enormous advantage owing to its small diameter This is the reason that there has been a progressive reduction in the bore until it has been reduced to its present small section Of two bullets of equal weight and of equal diameter the longer bullet has a better range With regard to the head of the bullet the particular type which offers the very least re sistance is that known as ogival which means that the curve is made up of a part of the circle the radius of which is equal to two diameters of the base of the bullet This is shown perfectly well in a Mauser or in a Lee Metford bullet The LeeMetford bullet is a more destructive bullet than the Mauser This opinion is based upon the cases of a num ber of wounded Boers we had at Spearmans Camp after the battle of Vaal Krautz and also upon the reports especially the report of Dr Mackenzie in the Lancet of February 17th who gives an account of a certain number of wounded Boers These specimens I have brought back are all without excep tion from the Boer trenches and they have been beauti fully mounted by Mr Shattock of the College of Surgeons I should say that all these bullets including the LeeMetford and the Mauserand this is a matter of the utmost import ance with regard to bone injuriesare made up of a core com posed of lead hardened with 2 per cent of antimony and of a shell or thimble made up of 80 per cent copper and 20 per cent nickel So far as I know the thimble or shell of the Mauser and LeeMetford are exactly the same The Lee Metford and the Mauser bullets both placed on a level base are shown of natural size Figs 3 and 5 The LeeMetford is the larger missile of the two but as a matter of fact the difference in size is comparatively slight For instance the LeeMetford measures 125 inch the Mauser 119 The diameter of the LeeMetford bullet is 0311 inch the diameter of the Mauser is 0284 inch The weight of the LeeMetford bullet is 215 grs the weight of the Mauser is 173 grs I may mention that the weight of the MartiniHenry bulletthe most destructive bullet seen in this campaignis 480 grs the length 127 in and the diameter 045 The Mauser bullet has a groove in the bottom of the cartridge to fix into the clips for Mauser cartridges are carried in clips of five which is the size of the magazine In the section of the Mauser bullet Fig 6 and cartridge case the smokeless powder which is black and like minute pieces of coal is seen packed up at the bottom of the cartridge  the core is of hardened lead and the thimble composed of copper and nickel In the section of bullet and cartridge case the cordite is seen in the LeeMetford Fig 4 arranged in strings like gelatine The extraordinary thing is that Thomas Atkins extracts this cordite which is made from nitroglycerine from the cartridge and eats it It is a mild form of stimulant I pass now to what I think is a very important matter This slide Figs 8 and 9 shows the thimbles of a LeeMetford and a Mauser bullet A gunsmith has dissolved the lead out and left the shell intact An untouched Mauser is also shown The weight of the thimble varies very considerably that of the LeeMetford weighs 33 gr of the Mauser 22 gr They are quite different at the apex The Mauser seems to have been strengthened at the apex The LeeMetford is about the same thickness throughout and the breaking of the cap or tue apex of the bullets is a matter of very considerable im portance The Fine Hitting of the Mauser There is I suppose no smallbore bullet that can effect the same perforations as this bullet can I have here a specimen one of the strangest I have seen It is a LeeMetford cartridge which was carried in the cartridge case of a man who was in theas8ault on Spion Kop The Mauser bullet has passed through the centre of the cartridge and the point of entry and the point of exit can be seen It has hardly bent the cart ridge and the cordite is perfectly intact in the interior The May 12 1900 ROYAL MEDICAL AND CHIRURGICAL SOCIETY LTm

of the Boers in that last engagement reduced to his very last round There were several cases ontheMooi River of a nerve being penetrated by Mauser bullet One bullet which I have made a button hole opening and went through a nerve without dividing it We had several cases of bones perforated by the Mauser bullet as though a gimlet had been passed through The most picturesque case of that was a man who was shot in the armoured train fight between Frere and Chieveley A Mauser bullet went through the middle phalanx of the ring finger and through the middle phalanx of the little finger making four perfect holes and he made an absolutely perfect re covery When I last saw that man you could1 not tell that the hand had been wounded I do not say his bones had been perforated because they were less in diameter than the section of the Mauser bullet but the fracture was so clean fiat he recovered with a useful hand As far as I have been able to see I believe the Mauser bullet is never diverted in the body Effects at Different Ranges There is another very important matter which this war will settle The textbooks on gunshot injuries all repeat this one formula that is that the mechanical power of a bullet the m asure of the work it can do is represented by the formula MVa M being the mass and V the velocity If that be true of course the range is everything If a man is shot at 150 yards his limb would be smashed  if at 1500 yards the wound would be trifling That is said to be based on experiments jn which corpses and dead animals had been shot at at various ranges I feel as certain as I can be of anything that that formula is wrong and I believe that when the details and data of this war are published that formula will be modified Of course it is very difficult to get a proper account of the range for every man says he was shot at a range of 150 or 200 yards With smokeless powder it is very difficult to get the range in most cases and in some there had been a cross fire and it was difficult to know from which side the man was shot From noting myself men who were struck down in an engagement which I was watching I was quite certain being 5 MLSiSjROYAL MEDIOAL AND CHIRURGICAL SOCIETYMay 12 190a able to form an idea of the range that range was not every thing Mr Dent whose very admirable letters in the British Medical Journal we have all read with such in struction says that the range matters very little Perhaps that is a little too strong but I am quite confident that the range does not mean what that formula MV2 means The11 Explosive  Effect The next point is as to the explosive effect of these bullets This unfortunate term has crept into the reports Of course there is no such thing as an explosive bullet it is a pre posterous term The term  expansile bullet may be perhaps justifiable and the explosive effect depends upon this that when a man is struck with a bullet it makes a small point of entrance and the rest of the wound is like an inverted funnel I have seen the point of entrance as big as what a soldier calls a bugbite and the point of exit the size of a fiveshilling piece1 or bigger the wound being practically funnelshaped It is not a question of the shock of the impact the wound is blown out the bone is broken and the fragments are driven up and down the limb so that there is a gap between the two ends This effect is uniform precise and easily recognised and is what is meant when the explosive effect of a bullet is spoken of There is a very positive cavity and the bone is separated by a real gap All the textbooks state that that is solely the effect of the velocity of the bullet or in other words the range of it  but I am confident that that is not accurate in regard to this smallbore bullet I notice from the textbooks that experiments on animals do not always quite agree Some say that the explosive effect is shown up to 500 yards and others up to 750 yards All I can say is that all the cases in which I have seen explosive effects have been at comparatively short range and I am certain it is not range and range only I have seen a perfectly clean perfora tion of a bone at a short range as for instance at Vaal Krantz where the firing was from one Boer ridge It is true tbat in every case in which explosive effects have been manifest it has been at a short range and in every instance in which the bullet has been retained it has been found to be deformed The Softrosed Bullet The bullet which I show Fig 2 I picked up in the Boer trenches after the Boers had evacuated Hlanganwe Hill The nickel casing of the bullet has been cut away at the top exposing the lead core which is not hardened with antimony The result is that the lead mushrooms out It has been said that the Boers use this that and the other bullet but I was through the whole of the Natal campaign and we never had any evidence of the socalled explosive bullet until the last thirteen days before the entrance into Ladysmith Then about 10 per cent of the wounds were due to softnosed bullets I must bear witness that the statements about the use of these bullets are not well founded  Poisoned Bullets Socalled A point uppermost in the public mind at this moment has reference to poisoned bullets and I have here an ordinary clip of Mauser bullets which I picked up at Colenso The bullet is coated with some bright green greasy material and it is evident the bullets have been dipped into something for the tallowlike material is seen adherent to the metal It is posi tively stated that this is poison I saw in the Daily News of as recent a date as three or four days ago the statement that these bullets had been dipped in verdigris I understand that verdigris is a basic acetate of copper and tbat it is poisonous Some of these clips all of which I picked up in the Boer trenches have been examined by Mr Hugh Candy the Lecturer on Chemistry at the London Hospital who re ports as the result of his chemical analysis that the green material is absolutely nonpoisonous The basis of the com pound is paraffin and the colour is due to an oxide of nickel  and as there is 20 per cent of nickel in the coating of this bullet it is reasonable to suppose that it is produced from the thimble and not from anything added Anyhow Mr Candy assures me that it has been examined for every reasonable poison but that the results have been negative  therefore this substance must have been used for the purpose of keeping the barrel free of fouling 1 38 cmm Shell Wounds With regard to shell wounds I will say nothing except that we met with both common shell and shrapnel Nothing is more magnificent than the bursting of English shrapnel  and the sight of the last assault at Ladysmith when there were ninetyfour guns playing upon Pieters Hill was a sight which could not be equalled on this earth It was towards the end of the evening the sun was lighting up the edge of the ridge and at the back was a thunder cloud rising over Umbulwana The shrapnel looking ike puffs of white snow afforded a very marvellous spectacle Common shell for the 47 gun is an explosive cylindrical  hollow cell containing a bursting charge The effect of the explosion is seen from the dust it raises and the bits of stone it knocks up I picked up pieces of shell which were hurled out by the shell bursting some of tke pieces of which might be driven right through a mans head One particular specimen I have shown is apiece of a shell from Long Tom which was fired into a street at Ladysmith I brought it from there and it was given me by the man who picked it up At the bottom of the specimen can be seen what is called the driving band and a notion can be formed of the gigantic weight of the shell fired by that enormous gun and how it breaks up into fragments Shrapnel I need not say is a conical shell containing from 150 to 200 bullets Fig 7 according to whether it is fired from a 12 or 1 pounder Shrapnel contains a bursting charge set off by a time fuse the endof the shrapnel is blown out and the bullets acquire the velocity of the missile All shrapnel breaks in the air and from a howitzer it breaks high up in the air and de scends The velocity of the descending shrapnel is the velocity of the missile itself and the bullet is not shot out of it by gunpowder The iron of the shell itself is twisted by the bursting charge The Boer shrapnel of which I have a specimen picked up in Ladysmith and not exploded is similar in shape to our shrapnel A waterbottle belonging to an English soldier at the battle field of Spion Kop shows the point of entrance or a shrapnel bullet which went through the waterbottle and then through the man the man recovered without any grave symptoms The bottle shows that the hole was a very clean one just taking the shrapnel bullet and not very much more The size of the shell of the Maxim gun is shown in Fig 1 Lyddite The Boer prisoners were not pleased with lyddite but it has nothing like the effect that is ascribed to it A lyddite shell bursting in soft ground as it did in a farm near Spearmans Camp makes certainly a big hole but if it falls on to well made ground such as railway road it does not make the enor mous cavern that has been described The fumes are always dense yellow Several Boers were brought in suffering from concussion produced by lyddite They remained insensible for oneor two days but without any sign of injury of any sort due to lyddite The smell of lyddite is very distressing and the best testimony as to this is from our own men Some of the Kings Royal Rifles in mounting a kopje to take a trench had one of our shells fall within a distance of 50 yards from them The officer in charge of the line told me that they could scarcely breatne  they had to keep their faces almost on the ground to avoid the awful stench of this explosive But I think the statement of the terrific effect of lyddite shells is exaggerated If one came into a room like the one we are in now it would not blow the whole place right out and to say that its fumes are absolutely poisonous is untrue Expansile Effect I show a specimen Fig 13 demonstrating the expansile effect of a Mauser bullet In this case the man was struck on the outer side of the deltoid muscle  the wound was a clean hole which would not have taken more than the point of a pencil It had produced an ordinary oblique fracture of the bone as was inevitable and it had blown away the head of the humrus On examination hardly any fragments of bone were found at all  they had been practically pulverised The bullet made a kind of trap door into the scapula and was found close to the vertebra The I bullet has been fixed on the scapula and is shown Modern SmallBore Rifle WoundsAuthors Clinton DentSource The British

SurgeonGeneral ODwyer PMO Aldershot advocated the desirability of the PMO on active service being on the staff of the General Commandingin Chief in order that he might be enabled to administer his department under the most favourable circumstances He also advocated that this PMO should have executive powers re sanitary matters and instanced many advantages which would result if it were so  he remarked that there were not many Generals who now sanctioned this SurgeonMajor Caverhill MB Lothians and Berwickshire Yeomanry considered that the authorities would have great difficulty in getting suitable candidates for the RAMC in the future First there were fewer entrants to the medical profes sion owing to the greater expense attending the extended cur riculum of five years study  and secondly the increased num ber of appointments in civil life caused by the abolition of the unqualified assistant conducting branch practices The RAMC was undermanned even in peace time  in an emergency their places could not be efficiently filled by undisci plined civil practitioners The deficiency of medical officers was the cause of great dissatisfaction as regards leave with its opportunities for study and keeping abreast of recent advances in medical science In the German army completely equipped bacteriological laboratories accompanied each army corps They were also to be found in the Russian army both in the medical and veterinary departments These were not pro vided for in our regulations The time had now come for the formation of a special sanitary organisation evolved from the ranks of the RAMC This body could be reinforced if need be by men of special training and great practical experience such as our county medical officers These medical officers of health as inspecting officers or as consultants would be of equal if not greater importance to the wellbeing of the army than the consulting surgeons appointed in the recent campaign SurgeonCaptain Harper MD VMSC said that in consequence of the drain of medical officers of the RAMC to South Africa many civilian practitioners had been called in to assist or take charge of military hospitals or troops at home A most important matter for consideration in this connection was the Volunteer Bill at present before the House of Commons which by substituting the words  sud den emergency for the words actual or apprehended invasion altered the whole position of the volunteer force Sudden emergency was far too elastic a term and practically meant nothing Sir Howard Vincents statement i the House that the volunteers on the whole were in favour of the change was so far as he could gather quite incorrect It was impossible that any large proportion of officers or men with families depending on them for support could remain in a force under the proposed new conditions If the Bill became law it would be followed by a very large number of resigna tions and those of many of the best and keenest officers and men The matter was one of vital importance both to the medical and combatant branches of the volunteer force SurgeonGeneral Hamilton in reply said that the position of PMOs on lines of communication was all wrong They ought to be with the general in command and under his instructions should issue orders to the subordinate PMOs In the same way PMOs should be on the immediate staff of the GOC and under his instructions correspond  by order The future supply of candidates was a most important question which must be gone into by the British Medical Association Volunteer medical officers would be in a very difficult position under the new Act if passed and men could not be expected to give up their practices to go off on a small salary to distant military stations MODERN SMALLBORE RIFLE WOUNDS By Clinton Dent FRCS Surgeon and Joint Lecturer on Surgery St Georges Hospital London So much has been written during the past few months on the subject of smallbore rifle woundsthat it is well nigh impossible to break new ground The surgeons who have been working in this campaign seem on the whole to be fairly well agreed as to the general lines for practice It may not be unprofitable if I endeavour to summarise some of the conclusions on surgical points so far as they appear to be justified by the evidence already collected This campaign has given us valuable ex perience of the effects of smallbore bullets travelling at high velocities Between the Mauser and the LeeMetford rifle there does not appear to me to be really anything to choose if we regard solely the destructive effects of the weapon There can be little doubt I think that our service rifle has shown itself to be a thoroughly good weapon and one that deteriorates very slowly from hard work My experience was almost wholly derived from wounds inflicted by the Mauser bullet but the same views really must hold good for both weapons One difference perhaps of importance in the LeeMetford and Mauser bullet is the steel sheath of the latter which breaks up worse It may still be a question for military experts to determine whether the smallbore rifle as at present adopted is suitable for every sort of warfare It is pretty clear that for the South African campaign it was eminently fitted and has proved altogether a success At the same time I believe that the tendency in the future will not be in the direction of further diminution of bore increase in rapidity of twist and diminution of weight of bullet thereby securing higher velocity and longer range Already it would seem that the range of modern rifles is longer than is really absolutely necessary Efforts will be made no doubt to increase the flatness of trajectory and the frequency of short range wounds will increase Much has been said as to the importance of the stopping action of bullets and it is asserted that the small high velocity bullet does not compare favourably with the older weapon in this respect For civilised warfare however the stopping action is certainly quite adequate and as warfare with savage tribes is likely to become less frequent andas moreover commercial enterprisetends to provide belligerents in every part of the globe with modem weapons longrange warfare is likely to become more and more the rule For some time to come therefore bullet woundsand these still constitute the huge majority of wounds received in warfareare likely to be of the class that we have had to deal with in the Boer war Broadly speaking in the South African campaign bullet wounds of all kinds have done well Recoveries from very severe wounds have been numerous and many of these recoveries have been most  remarkable The percentage of wounded men who have been  fit to return to duty has been unusually high Wounds causing permanent disability are less frequent than was formerly the case Injuries of the limbs necessitating ampu tation are it will be found fewer proportionately than in any previous war Conservative surgery hasand most properly been carried further and with highly successful results than I in former campaigns These satisfactory results have been as I cribed mainly to the socalled humanity of the modern smallbor e bullets and it would seem to follow from this that from the military point of view the modern weapons do not fulfil the  prime conditions of warfare If the victory is to rest with the Sept 8 1900MODERN SMALLBORE RIFLE WOUNDS mSlSSa 33 side that can most quickly kill or efficiently disable a I large number of its adversaries then wars are likely to be prolonged and the humanity of the bullet would prove to be but a curse in disguise I think the socalled humanity of a smallbore bullet a great deal exaggerated There are other conditions to be reckoned with In the South African campaign I believe that the surgical healthiness of the climate and the wide adoption of the openair method of treatment have had quite as great a share in bringing about the favourable statistics as the character of the weapons employed The idea is far too prevalent that the injury inflicted by a smallbore bullet is almost trifling whatever part be hit It is largely a question of whether the wound becomes septic or not and septic com plications attacking either bullet or operation wounds have been very rare Indeed in South Africa operation wounds of all kinds have done exceptionally well This possibly may be ascribed to the efficiency with which the antiseptic system has been carried out in military surgery But truly aseptic surgery is practically impossible under the conditions of active service It is a matter of the faithful observance of elabo rate detail by all and they are many concerned in the opera tion Surgeons have to do the best they can in base as well as field hospitals and they have to work with orderlies  a hard working and highly septic body of men The want of dressers in a military hospital is to my mind more felt than in a civil hospital Certain views that have recently obtained with regard to bullet wounds have now I think been finally exploded but these cherished traditions die rather hard and one still sees reference to them One of these is that the heating of the bullet sears the track of the wound and so destroys any germs that might lodge favouring thus the immediate union and preventing any septic complications The ballets as a matter of fact fired from modern mallbore rifles are in the first place usually sterile for they have a hard smooth surface and in the next place they are not heated  but even if white hot the time that they occupy in passing through the body is so extremely short that no cauterising action could possibly be exerted The arrest of movement might heat the bullet but a bullet that can travel a couple of miles and hit hard at the end of it does not have much movement arrested and thereby con verted into heat A bullet making a flesh wound 6 or 8 inches long occupies at a range of 800 to 1000 yards somewhere about tcVq of a second A bullet that strikes a bone and lodges has its forward movement and its rotation arrested but no cauterising action is found in the neighbourhood of such and the energy is really dissipated in other directions of which the effect is very manifest  and this brings me to another theory that is now I think pretty generally dis carded  the socalled hydrodynamic or hydraulic theory has been held to explain the extending or explosive effects of rifle bullets on animal tissues Those who believe in this theory look upon a limb as a closed vessel containing fluid and account for the destruction which is undoubtedly seen some times at short range as due to the enormous increase of pres sure caused by the ingress of the bullet on the incompressible contents of the part hit This theory though abandoned for the most part with regard to the greater part of the body is till considered by some to hold good for penetrating wounds of the skull Experiments however do not bear out the hydraulic view and the explosive or expanding effects are now held to be due to the energy of the bullet which radiates out in lines from the long axis of the bullet track The hydraulic theory is now almost as wholly discarded as the projectile air theory This imagines that a cushion of highly compressed air is carried in in front of the bullet and exercises the explosive effect This is an old theory which has been recently revi ved Itmaybeheard of again but it is hardly worth while at present to administer the coup de grce to what is already defunct So again wind contusions from large projectiles are no longer believed in They disappeared when round shot ceased to be used For round shot would strike a part and inflict the most grievous injury on the deeper tissues though as they glanced off the skin might show no mark whatever As instances of cases in which military surgery is now much more conservative may be cited penetrating abdominal wounds compound fractures wounds of joint and nerve in juries There is a general consensus of agreement that the great bulk of penetrating abdominal wounds are best left alone The hopes that recent advance in abdominal surgery might lead to great improvement in the treatment of these serious injuries has been altogether falsified Patients operated on generally speaking do not do well or in other words the majority die It is impossible to make a thorough examination of the viscera and to ensure that every wound of the intestineand the wounds may be very numerous indeed from a single shotis dealt with without inflicting the most grievous damage on the abdominal contents Adhesions which form with great rapidity are likely to be broken down haemorrhage set up and extravasation of the in testinal contents brought about by manipulation On the other hand a remarkable number of cases in which the intestines have been undoubtedly perforated perhaps in many places have recovered The patients can seldom if ever be operated on early enough or get the lengthy and un divided attention that their condition would require in the field hospitals  and even if they could secure this their chances of recovery would probably be little increased A large proportion of cases of wound of the large intestines do well Patients with these injuries have their best chance if they have been long fasting and if they abstain for a long time after from any sort of drink  even a glass of water if given too early may bring about a fatal result in a man who might otherwise recover The shock of smallbore bullets in abdominal wounds is very much less than might be expected  indeed former views as to shock from all kinds of bullet wounds must now be greatly modified The ingenious view has been put forward that the wound of the intestine pro duces a sort of tetanus of the gut and that the arrest of the peristaltic action allows time for lymph to be exuded while the slits in the intestine are sealed up Wounds of joints perhaps show the most remarkable contrast of any class of injuries compared with former experience Very few cases have gone wrong where the kneejoint has been wounded by bullets and I can recall a number of cases of wounds of joints such as the elbow which have done perfectly well without any complication or operation Primary excisions have been excessively rare Formerly it was considered highly conservative surgery to save the limb by operating on the joint now the joint can be left alone Wounds of the anklejoint have on the whole done worse than any others Of nerve injuries which are very common indeed it need only be said here that the expectant treatment has proved the best Many cases were operated on at the outset in which it was imagined that the nerve had been wholly or partially divided in which it was found that the trunk was quite intact and that the bullet track had only been near it While the extent of recovery in these cases is very great it is seldom in my experience altogether complete but the main point is that it is not likely to be rendered more complete by operation even when a mechanical lesion that can be dealt with is found SurgeonGeneral ODwyer wanted to know how the more frequent nerve injuries with the smallbore bullet when con tracted with those caused by larger bullets could be explained In wounds through the lungs even though the patient might be fit to resume his duties he always when questioned com plained of a little shortness of breath Why if the South African climate was eo effective in healing wounds was not civil surgery more successful there  He thought the prompt use of the first field dressing and instructing men how to do so had had much to do with the success mentioned He was glad to know that it was now an established fact that abdominal wounds from smallbore bullets had better be left alone What was the proportion of wounds from field guns   Septic orderlies  on field service were difficult to avoid SurgeonGeneral Hamilton said that fiat trajectory was what the military authorities aimed at and that it was a convertible term with velocity The great object of course was that any mistake in judging distance was remedied by the flatness of the trajectory He assisted Mr John Rigby years ago in experiments with express bullets and they found that bullets propelled by small charges penetrated into sawdust much further than when fired with large charges This was of course caused by the bullet not setting up or mushrooming as it did when fired with 634 mSSJjSSLSECTION OF NAVY ARMY AND AMBULANCESept 8 1900 heavy charges The larger the bullet the greater the shock and when shooting big game in India he found that a spherical bullet from a smooth bore stopped the charge of a tiger or a bear better than smaller bore express bullets The smaller the bullet the less the shock and in this way the modern bullet was more merciful Mr Clinton Dent in reply said he knew many cases of joint wounds in which this field dressing was not employed for many hours  one especially a wound of the kneejoint and j popliteal artery which made an excellent recovery He con sidered it was now proved that nerves and tendons might be pushed aside by smallbore bullets but thought the high velocity accounted for some nerve injuries the nerve not being visibly injured He considered the South African climate more favourable for wound treatment than that of this country According to Mr Cecil Rhodes artillery fire demoralised   it gets on your nerves though it may not kill much The effect of artillery fire at Paardeberg was lessened by Lord Robertss humanity the fire being directed mainly on the commissariat  at Magersfontein the trenches indicated great effects from shrapnel He was satisfied that the expectant treatment in abdominal wounds from small bore bullets was best SurgeonGeneral Henry Skey Muir CB MD War Office mentioned a case of a smallbore bullet in South Africa striking the cervical spine and carrying away two teeth in its exit the patient now being in fair health INFECTIOUS DISEASE ON BOARD SHIP By W J Colborne StaffSurgeon RN The ships of Her Majestys Navy are now such complicated engines of war and so filled with machinery that the space that can be allotted to the sick is necessarily limited but although limited it is sufficient for all the ordinary ailments and diseases met with  yet provision cannot be made for isolation and observation wards and so it behoves the medical officer to take such measures as he can to prevent the onset of infectious diseases and when they do arise to combat them with the means at his disposal so as to limit their spread and to safeguard the health of the patient and that of the ships company Our ships now carry many men  they visit ports in all parts of the world  a large amount of leave is given to visit the shore  and the crew consists of young men  and therefore the possibility of infectious disease being contracted is very con siderable Retnembering all this one of the first duties of the medical officer on visiting a port is to make inquiries from the port authorities as to the prevalence or absence of infec tious disease its extent and the district affected and should it be necessary report the same to the proper authorities of the ship so that they may take the necessary steps to either warn the men from visiting a particular district or restrict the leave Circumstances alone can be a guide as to the necessity of curtailing the leave and the length of time the ship remains in the port The medical officer will also have to pay attention to the people who are allowed on board the shipparticularly washer women bumboatmen etc Knowing of the existence of infectious disease on shore particular attention must be paid to all minor ailments that may occur amongst the men and endeavour should be made to detect the premonitory sym ptoms and on the slightest doubt arising the patient should be immediately isolated from his fellows for as long as neces sary and carefully watched  a careful watch must also be kept on those who are his more immediate neighbours both at mess and at night To isolate the patient is not always an easy matter on fcoard ship and diligent search will have to be made for a spare cabin small watertight compartment or such other suitable place and if none are to be found below decks a suitable structure of canvas if the weather will permit will have to be built on the upper deck Should the case develop into one of an infectious nature steps must be taken to isolate the patient and his nurse or attendant at once  and having obtained a spare cabin or com partment it should be prepared for their reception by re moving all movable articles swinging service cots and bed ding as well as utensils taken to the place and the ventila tion attended to particular care being taken that the venti lating trunk opens direct on the upper deck so as to avoid the possibility of the infection being carried to other parts of the ship by means of these trunks  if necessary the ventilation openings in this compartment should be closed and sealed The patient and attendant should be kept strictly to this com partment and neither of them allowed to leave it till oppor tunity occurs to send the patient to hospital Should no cabin or compartment be available and it be impossible ta erect a temporary place on deck part of the sick bay must be screened off and this can be done by making a canvas screen which can be so fitted by the carpenters with battens so as ta reach from the beams above and to the deck beneath and effectually cut off this part of the sick bay and be used for the isolation of both patient and nurse During the treatment of the case the screen should be kept moist or damp by spraying or other means with perchloride of mercury solution i in 1000 and the deck frequently washed with the same The food should be placed outside and taken thence by the nurse and all excreta mixed with disinfectants before removal The medical officer in attendance should wear a linen overall on visiting his patient and be particular as to the disinfection of his hands and face etc and should go straight from the patient on deck and remain there some time before mix ing with his messmates and others On the opportunity occurring for the patient to be sent to hospital the patients bed and bedding as well as the attendant and his clothes should be sent and the boat washed with perchloride of mer cury solution 1 in 1000 afterwards The attendant can be left to nurse the patient or can be disinfected and kept under observation for a short period  the men who have carried the patient to hospital should also be disinfected The bed bed ding and clothing must be disinfected by moist heat in a disinfector before being received on board again The place occupied by the patient on board the ship should now be dis infected The compartment should be sealed the screen made wet with perchloride of mercury solution and sulphur burnt not less than 3lbs of sulphur to each 1000 cubic feet of space being used The compartment and its contents should then be thoroughly scrubbed with perchloride solution 1 in iooo the screen taken down and soaked for twentyfour hours in perchloride solution and then scrubbed and hung in the air the wooden battens burnt and the paint work should be repainted or limewashed During the presence of infectious disease on board ship all men should be warned to report every slight ailment to the medical officer who will watch every case and endeavour by every means in his power to discover the onset of the disease and by early isolation check the spread of the disease Should a case of small pox occur every man on board the ship must be vaccinated Should the ship be in a port where there is hospital accommodation cases should be landed immediately and should the case be one of suspicion only it is better that the patient should be landed for isolation and observation fo a few days than run any risk of the disease occurring on board If care is taken to isolate cases immediately on the appear ance of the disease and attention be paid to details the spread of the disease is practically limited and the chance of an epi demic on board is reduced to a minimum Whether any good result would accrue from the use of aerial disinfection such as carbolic vapour or spray which could be used during the treatment of the disease and at the same time be innocuous and pleasant to the patient I must leave to those who have had some experience of their use SANITATION IN CAMPS By Major James RAMC A subject which covers too much ground to be more than touched in one paper which therefore consists of a series of suggestions cannot pretend to be complete on any one point But its importance cannot be exaggerated when one considers the proportion of deaths from disease in armies to those from wounds The conditions of camps are so various and depend upon so many circumstances that there are few points that apply to all in the matter of detail The objects however to be kept in view in all cases are   i Protection of troops from weather and climate Sir William Mac Cormac And Mr Treves At The Reform ClubSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2053 May 5 1900 pp 1125112620264481 1155 May 5 QOQJWAR SURG ONS AT THE REFORM CLUBUfeS II2S Dr Tinker Hyde consented to move the resolution as an amendment  and this was seconded by Mr George Jackson who was in favour of it because he objected to the principle that a practitioner should have as many votes as qualifica tions  the true principle he thought was one man one vote The amendment on being put to the vote was lost and the resolution carried At the afternoon session in the absence of the Chairman Dr Hime took the chair and Mr R B Anderson read a paper on A Medical Polity  Corporate and Medical Reform The Midwife Question Dr Cox in introducing his resolution That this Conference protests against any legislation that will have the effect of giving a legal status to midwives as a class said that he meant to object to the principle of registering midwives as midwifery practitioners He had been told it was now too late but none the less he brought that resolution forward The opinion of the profession had been repeatedly shown to be opposed to this legislation It was bad for the public and he thought the profession should honestly express their opinion on the subject and if in spite of that the public chose to insist on this legislation the harm that was likely to follow would be at the door of the public He did not think it necessary to give reasons why the registration of midwives would be so harmful to the public as he thought the delegates there must know as well as he did what they were Dr Dolan seconded the resolution and a discussion ensued in which Drs Whittaker Woodcock Ritchie Nash Langley Browne Rees and RatcliffGaylard opposed the resolution Mr Victor Horsley also spoke against the sweeping character of Dr Coxs resolution and said that if the Con ferece adopted it it would practically put the other resolu tions on the subject that followed out of order Dr Major Greenwood asked Dr Cox if by his resolution he objected to any legal status being givenas for instance thai of an obstetrical nurse He asked this question as Dr Ritchie had said that any control given by legislation implied a legal status and it could hardly be said that no control was admif sble Mr Anderson Dr Helme Dr Broadbent and Dr Brassey Brier ley agreed with the resolution Dr Cox in answer said he did not mean by his resolution that all control was inadmissible but that there should be no legislation to recognise them as practitioners of midwifery Because they existed it was not necessary for the profession to upport them any more than it was necessary for them to try to exterminate them The only extermination that could be brought about would be by educating the public to see the wisdom of not employing them The resolution was put by the Chairman and was carried 19 voting for the resolution and 16 against The Chairman then ruled that the resolutions dealing with midwife legislation put down by Dr Owen Morris Birken head and Dr RatcliffGaylard were now out of order and could not be considered Medical Education Dr Stewart Manchester then moved  That while appreciating the action of the General Medical Council in raising the standard of preliminary education this Conference is of opinion that a still higher standard would further raise the status of the profession collectively and individually and promote the public wel fare This was seconded by Dr Wilkinson and after some dis cussion was carried Dr Crawshaw then moved  That it is desirable that every medical student should subsequently to the date of his passing the examination in anatomy physiology and materia medica be compelled to spend as part of his curriculum twelve months with a general practitioner The mover said that the recent action of the General Medical Council in disapproving of unqualified assistants had become a means of depriving students of a certain kind of practical knowledge It might be that that knowledge was not of a scientific character but it was of a necessary kind and such as he could not get at the hospital It should be limited to twelve months and the pupil should be protected irom having too much to do Dr George Jackson seconded the resolution but he said he only approved of it sub modo Dr Rees objected to it Dr Woodcock said it was really a return to the old unquali fied assistants After some discussion the resolution was put to the vote and lost by a considerable majority There were present at the Conference 33 delegates At different times during the day about a dozen practitioners attended as spectators of the proceedings SIR WILLIAM MAC CORMAC AND MR TREVES AT THE REFORM CLUB The Reform Club gave a dinner on April 28th to Sir William Mac Cor mac and Mr Frederick Trves both of whom are members of the club in recognition of their conspicuous services to the wounded in South Africa The Earl of Rosebery presided and amongst the company which exceeded 100 in number were Lord Russell of Killowen Lord Burghclere Sir H Fowler MP Mr H Glad stone MP Sir N Lockyer Dr Farquharson MP Dr Stephen Mackenzie Mr Malcolm Morris Dr Mapother Sir C Nixon and several other medical members of the Club After giving The Queen Lord Rosebery proposed the toast of the evening  Sir William Mac Cormac and Mr Trves He said that in a war in which there had been such diversity of opinion there had been unanimity only on one point and enthusiastic unanimitythat the medical and hospital service had been practically perfect The Government had been able to obtain the men and give the supplies which these men had used The Government sent for the two most eminent men they could think of and the Government gave them a free hand All honour to the Government and all honour to the men Without a second thought they left their great connections in this country and went out for six months to take a share in the hospital and surgical work for the army Their names needed no mention from him Sir William MacCormacs name was a household word He had been for four successive years chosen President of the College of Surgeons an honour he believed almost unprecedented if not unique In the FrancoPrussian war in the bloody and thunderous scene at Sedan Sir William Mac Cormac was continuously carrying on surgical operations He had brought his experience and skill to bear upon our war and soldiers in their turn Mr Trves too had left a great practice and applied his unrivalled sur gical skill in the same way His name was a household word among them and he need not expatiate upon it But he had seen it stated in a paper that he was about to enter Parlia ment It was stated that he had been consulted about it and that he had said he would rather enter the grave He trusted that if this was authentic he would take the oppor tunity to explain it Lord Rosebery concluded by saying that they were not merely honouring two eminent men and two fellowmembers of the Reform Club they I were not merely honouring a consummate act of patriotism on their part but they were paying honour to the noncom batant members of the army They were glad to see that one Major Babtie received the other day the Victoria Cross He was not sure that the noncombatant members of the army had received their fair share of the Victoria Cross Their heroism was not less than the heroism of those engaged in forlorn hopes and they had shown that they were as incapable of fear as much as the soldiers whom they tend Sir W Mac Cormac in reply after returning thanks for the I honour done him said he went out to South Africa with some reluctance he might now admit but deemed it right to go I from a sense of duty Our soldiers had fought under condi tions which might well dissuade the bravest in a country of I appalling difficulties advancing in the open against an un I seen enemy who poured a pitiless hail of bullets into them I like rain and who themselves were practically unseen and I safe from our assault To illustrate this he referred to the i6 mA5J EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE BRAN May 5 90C battle of Colenso On that day we had some 1140 casualties We all believed rightly or wrongly that Boer statements on the subject of their losses were not very trustworthy He Had had an opportunity of learning he thought on good authority what the Boer losses were on that occasion He heard from the other side from the German officers who were there watching the methods of Boer warfare and the state ment was subsequently most positively confirmed by the Free State Secretary Mr Fischer with whom he had several conversations that the total loss of the Boers on that day was 5 killed and 25 wounded  and this he thought might well be true for our people never caught sight of a Boer the whole day Commandant Albrecht the Boer artillery captain calculated that 12 Boers were killed and 40 wounded for every 1000 fired of our shells The comparative want of gravity in the wounds inflicted by the Mauser bullet was very remarkable Men recovered after being shot through every part of the body and 96 per cent of those treated in the base hospitals recovered from their injuries Another very remarkable fact was the fewness of the amputations performed During the first four months of the war only twenty amputations were performed at the No 1 General Hospital at Wynberg Our LeeMetford projectile inflicted a very similar kind of wound but the Boer wounded were not so well treated as ours were The Boers did not possess as our troops did a first field dressing whose speedy application doubtless saved much life and suffering During his stay in South Africa he had an opportunity of examining the medical arrangements both throughout the Cape Colony and Natal and he did not himself believe it would be possibleand he was able to con trast what he had seen with his experience of former warsto have anything more complete or better arranged On the part of the Government authorities there was nothing that was suggested nothing that money could purchase that was not forthcoming when and where it was wanted The supply of medical requirements was lavish and what was above all praiseworthy these enormous supplies did not re main heaped up at Capetown Durban or Port Elizabeth but were distributed to the various hospitals over many hundreds of miles of country In spite of all the difficulties of provision ing such a large army so many miles from their base he found that wherever he might be the soldier received a daily supply of fresh meat and bread and that therefore except perhaps during the actual hours of fighting the hardships ex perienced by our men in the matter of commissariat might be counted as not worth mentioning Officers and men received the same supplies and his own actual experience proved on many occasions the excellence of these commodities After referring to the good effects of the war in uniting the Colonies to the Mother Country he said of the medical arrangements that they were better than they had ever been before Of the medical officers it might be said that they had shown them selves tobe without fear as most certainly they were without reproach Mr Trves endorsed what Sir William Mac Cormac had said about the treatment of the sick in South Africa It was perfectly true that there had never been a campaign in which the horrors of war had been so mitigated and where the treat ment of wounded had been so complete His lot was cast with the field hospital which followed the Ladysmith relief column from beginning to end He was present at every engagement from the battle of Colenso to the relief of Lady smith and their hospital small as it was received the wounded during the whole of the Natal campaign with the exception of the slight cases After one nights battle Spion Kop 715 wounded were put into the hospital camp One afternoon they had orders to clear the camp of wounded before sunrise next day and men were borne on 150 stretchers by hand to Frere twentysix miles a thing which he believed had never been done in a campaign before The medical men serving in the war owed much to General Buller who took a remarkable interest in the surgical necessities of the campaign and showed great anxiety about the accommodation of the sick and wounded During the time he himself was at the seat of war he saw much of the common soldier He was struck not only with the patriotism and admirable pluck of these men but with their almost feminine kindness to each other and their extreme unselfishness So far as the fiick were concerned there were two plagues in South Africa  the plague of flies and the plague of women The flies could be got rid of by means of horsehair wisps gauze and other appliances and the flies disappeared at night But the women mentioned in Sir Alfred Milners proclamation were absolutely a terror They came out in the guise of amateur nurses having exhausted every other form of excitement  they took up the time of the officers and in fact had the camp to themselves Considering the kind of war in which we were engaged and the number of lives lost the picture of a number of elaborately dressed ladies masquerading in summer toilets and arranging picnics about Capetown was a blot on the campaign The Lord Chief Justice proposed the health of The Chairman and Lord Rosebery in responding said Mr Trves forgot to rise to the fly he threw over him about enter ing Parliament He was inclined to think it was from a merciful consciousness that if he did choose to enter Parlia ment he would cut out most of the leaders in rhetoric that adorned those two chambers THE EFFECT OF SMALL DOSES OF ALCOHOL ON THE BRAIN The second Lees and Raper Memorial Lecture was delivered by Mr Victor Horsley FRS on April 27th at St James Hall The chair was taken by Mr Augustine Birrell QC MP who after the Hon Secretary of the Lees and Raper Memorial Fund had stated the facts concerning the inauguration of these lectures said that they were met to hear Mr Horsley who was known asa fearless investigator of truth and the I servant of science  He was a great authority on the brain and what the country now wanted more than anything else in the supreme councils of the nation on the battlefield in literature and philosophy was brains  and if Mr Horsley could tell them anything as to how they were to maintain the little brain they had got and how they could increase that store his services would be in demand not only by the tem perance party but by every political literary scientific philosophic and religious agency which existed in the country at the present time Selective Action of Alcohol Mr Horsley said that it was his duty to present to them from the scientific standpoint a plain statement of the present state of knowledge as to the effect produced on the brain by small doses of alcohol It probably was not generally known that all drugs had a selective action on the organs and tissues of the body that is to say they affected by reason of their chemical affinity some organs or parts of organs and spared others and this was particularly true of alcohol As Professor Ehrlich had pointed out it was merely a question of chemical affinity They must therefore first familiarise themselves with the various elements of the nervous system which in vestigation had shown te be the commonest point of attack The speaker proceeded to give a rapid survey of the central nervous system illustrating the subject by means of lantern slides In considering the effect of small quantities of alcohol on the central nervous system it was necessary to discuss its effect on ideation that is the intellectual thinking apparatus next on the voluntary action apparatus and then on the qere bellar apparatus for the regulation of movement and equilibra tion The activity of the highest psychical centres of the brain was estimated in various ways The activity of the brain in executing the decision of a thought arising from the stimulation of a special sense centre could be estimated either by measuring the time the brain took to do some small task allotted to it first in the natural state and secondly when under the influence of alcohol or by estimating the amount of workfdone in a given time Increased Reaction Times The time occupied by the nervous system in observing and recording the simplest thing was called  the reaction time and was so appreciable that in all minute and accurate records astronomers had to measure their reaction period and to account for it The lecturer then demonstrated by an experi ment the method of measuring the reaction time This plan in all forms and varieties had been very largely employed by I Professor Kraepelinwhose

cher  PROFESSOR LOMBROSO ON THE BOERS From a study of certain writings of Professor Lombroso we had derived the impression that in his eyes the whole human race is more or less degenerate or at any rate that in any given civilised country the members of the popula tion presenting none of the signs which in his opinion in dicate degeneracy are rare exceptions We gather however from an article by him which appeared in a recent number of the Nuova Antologa that he has found one nation which fulfils his ideal of perfect manhood To his mind the Boers are the coming race  even now they are the salt of the earth We know that the Boers look upon themselves as the chosen people and they will doubtless think highly of the judgment of the Turin Professor who shares that belief In the opening words of his article Professor Lombroso boasts that from the very beginning of the war he main tained that in spite of their enormous inferiority in num bers they would be victorious This belief it appears was largely founded on the fact that they are fighting for a just cause which attracts to them the sympathies of the whole world translated into men money and perfected arms Then they are patriots and therefore of much greater value than the English  mercenaries Apparently the foreigners who represent a part of the translated sympathies aforesaid fight for sentiment Other points in the Boers favour are that they can live on  bilitony  sic and that they are habituated to a climate fatal to Europeans  Bilitony  is an instance of the de formations of foreign words and names with which readers of Professor Lombroso are painfully familiar and the re markable statement about the South African climate gives a measure of his accuracy as to facts The poet says Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just  but Pro fessor Lombroso puts the multiplying power of a just cause still higher for he says it quadruples the number of  the Boers Among their other advantages we are told that they enjoy a Government exactly suited to their character a statement which strikes us as a doubtful compliment  as the Krugerite oligarchy can hardly be regarded as a model of political virtue by anyone who knows what  honest statecraft means Professor Lombroso describes it as an  absolutely free Government   but to those who have lived under it the freedom of the Government has seemed to be etsercised chiefly in administrative wrong doing He speaks of the Boers as a  meek  people and although he does not generally go to Holy Writ for support of his opinions it may be on that ground that his prophetic soul leads him to foresee that they shall inherit the earth When midway through his article the Professor appears suddenly to have awakened to the fact that the Boers have not been fulfilling his predictions of victory But after all that is only a fact and what is fact against so pretty a theory as he has framed about the glorious des tinies of Mr Krugers burghers Professor Lombroso faith in the triumph of the Boers remains unshaken be cause  the power of liberty can conduct a chosen people like the Boers to victory even against forces forty times greater We have already seen that the justice of their cause combined with the sustaining properties of bil itony quadruples their fighting strength  now defeat combined with Professor Lombrosos faith in liberty is to make them forty times stronger As he assures us that the said faith is indestructible it becomes an interesting arithmetical problem to determine what higher multiple of four will represent the fighting strength of the Boers when they are finally crushed So rooted is his belief in his conclusions that he says that even if England after one or two years of warfare came out victorious he would not change them Whatever their losses maybe Professor Lombroso assures the world that the Boers are certain to win in the long run because they carry out the biblical precept  Increase and multiply so successfully that they must ultimately form a nation which will  stagger humanity  by its valour and virtue With characteristic in capacity to see things as they really are Professor Lombroso takes no account of the effects of British rule which when the time of blood and iron is overpast will transform the Boers into British subjects as loyal as the people of Canada June i6 igog THE THEORY OF IONS U JBSSa 487 The only defect he sees in his chosen race is an undue tenderness in the treatment of their conquered foes This tenderness we are given to understand is not reciprocated by the brutal Briton Here again we are inclined to agree with the professor for we think that such exhibitions of amiable weakness as shooting British soldiers under the white flag should be dealt with by hanging rather than by protests Professor Lombroso forsees a dismal future for England for victory even if fortune favours her army is sure to end in her ruin Carried away by the reactionary force of Imperialism she will prefer to industrial progress and to the increase of her trade the barbaric crown of military glory She will bow the knee before her victorious warriors who as soon as they set their conquering foot on their native shores will set themselves to upset the Constitution These Cassandralike vaticinations will move the British people to laughter rather than to alarm May we remind Professor Lombroso that we have won battles and conquered nations before now and none of these doleful consequences which he sees to be in store for us have come about There is not we venture to think the slightest danger that Lord Roberts will go down to the House of Commons and order the SerjeantatArms to take away the  bauble  which it is the privilege of that functionary to carry  and we doubt if even at the height of his present popularity General BadenPowell would be permitted to eize Windsor Castle and proclaim himself king Rapt into future times the Italian seer beholds rising in a majestic vision before his minds eye the United States of Africa These are to divide the world with the United States of America while the mouldering thrones and effete tyrannies and superstitions of degenerate Europe crumble into dust He is indeed fain to admit that Mr Kruger has sometimes shown an  ultraconserva tive tendency while Great Britain is a most important centre of civilisation and internal liberty But alas  she has in recent years forsaken the glorious traditions of Gladstone and as a consequence entered upon a period of decadence as Venice did before her She finds it neces sary to bind her colonies to her by the bonds of militarism and for this reason Professor Lombroso cannot find it in his heart to bless her Well as was said of Italy by a famous countryman of his Great Britain far  da se a phrase which for our present purpose may be taken to mean that she will try to do without the blessing of Pro cessor Lombroso  THE THEORY OF IONS One meets with much reference to ions in modern chemical literature and a few words about the socalled  Ionic Hypothesis or the Electrical Dissociation Theory may therefore be of interest We all know that when an electric current passes through such a liquid as a solution of hydrochloric acid the dissolved substance is decomposed into components in this case hydrogen and chlorine which are set free at two quite distinct points in the liquidnamely the electrodes or places where the current enters and leav ss the solution Since the hydrogen and chlorine are not given off at the same place it appears that one or both of Ahese elements must have wandered through the liquid from the place at which it was liberated to the electrode at which it is set free An element or group of elements in this wandering state divorced from the rest of the original molecule is called an ion from the Greek word meaning going Some elements or groups of elements such as hydrogen the metals and ammonium are always set free at the negative electrode and these were called by Faraday cations because they go down the positive current while other elements or groups of elements such as chlorine oxygen sulphion SO and nitrion N03 always appear at the positive electrode and were called by Faraday  anions  because they  go up  against the current If we assume the cations to be all charged with positive electricity their attraction by the negative electrode is explained while at the same time the anions must be supposed to bear charges of negative electricity which they discharge on the positive electrode If we further assume I that every atom of hydrogen and the equivalent amount of every metal bear exactly the same electrical charge we can at once deduce Faradays wellknown electrolytic law that the quantity of the ions set free at the electrodes in an electrolyte depends solely on the amount of electricity that has passed through In fact the ions are the carriers of the electric current and each ion can only carry a fixed quantity of electricity The question that now arises is this  Are these ions free only while an electric current is passing through the liquid or do they exist in all liquids  The  ionic hypothesis  asserts that all liquids that are capable of being decom posed by electricity contain free ions even when they are not being subjected to electric influence and that the more dilute a solution the greater the percentage of dissociation of the dissolved substance into its constituent ions The ions are seldom if ever capable of existing apart from op positely charged ions Thus the hydrogen ion is held to consist of one atom only while free hydrogen consists of molecules each of which contains two atoms Thus a solu tion of hydrogen and chlorine in water contains molecules of each of these elements while a solution of hydrochloric acid contains atoms of each of the elementsKascent hydrogen may perhaps contain hydrogen ions or atoms at themoment of liberation but they quickly pair off into molecules There must always be an equal number of atoms of sodium and chlorine in a solution of sodium chloride in order that the positive charges of electricity on the sodium atoms may when added together be held bound by the negative charges on the chlorine atoms If by any means the number of chlorine atoms be increased beyond this number the extra chlorine atoms will combine in pairs forming ordinary chlorine gas Thus ionic dissociation does not alter the percentage composition of a salt Many of the ions are supposed to have a complicated structure thus all the sulphates are assumed in solution to contain sulphion S04 which is not known in the free state but when liberated at an electrode in presence of water immediately yields oxygen and sulphuric acid In like manner all acetates are supposed to contain the highly complex ion acetoxyl C2H302 which of course is not known as an independent substance If the ionic hypothesis be true then metallic salts in very The Needs Of The Medical Service Of The ArmySource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2082 Nov 24 1900 pp 1513151420266510 1210 Nov 24 1900THE ARMY MEDICAL SERVICEmLwax 1513 THE NEEDS OF THE MEDICAL SERVICE OF THE ARMY As reorganisation and reform in the Army Medical Service will probably soon engage the attention of the War Office it appears well to offer the following observations and sugges tions based on intimate knowledge of the inner life and duties of the service as well as on its external relations to the medical schools and the profession at large The statement represents broadly the wants disabilities and drawbacks which still make military service unpopular or at least undesirable among young medical men who other wise might contemplate an army career The following reforms the necessity for which has often been stated before may for ready comprehension be again recapitulated under a few heads  IRank and Title After prolonged controversy and opposition the late War Minister Lord Lansdowne granted to medical officers with the happier t results army rank and titles in a R yal corps That necessary and legitimate status was at once ungrudgingly accepted by the army at large and has undoubtedly much en hanced the efficiency of both officers and men in th campaign in South Africa All that now seems to be required under this head is that the corps be placed precisely on the same footing as other corps in the service subject to limitation in com mand This can be effected by expunging from the Regula tions such obsolete orders as may seem to imply infeiioriry in the army status of the medical service  by carry ing out  ffiidal procedure as in other branches  as for instance by gazetting to staff appointments  conferring local or temporary rank on those acting in superior appointments  giving due recogni tion in ceremonial functions and a fair share of honours and rewards etc IIUndermanning There need be no hesitation in stating that this notorious defect lies at the very root of the continued unpopularity of the service in the medical schools through farreaching con sequences operating as follows  a By necessitating sudden and frequent moves from station to station causing a feeling of constant apprehension and unrest and entailing much personal expenditure and Ions b By making ordinary leave most difficult to obtain and muchdesired  study leave impossible c By causing a serious disproportion between home and foreign tours of service whereby the average officer spends twothirds or even threefourths of his service abroad mostly in tropical climates d By rendering ordinary and especially  orderly  duties unduly severe and at times excessively harassing The evils of an undermanned establishment in peace be come much aggravated in time of war Before the Boer war with about onethird only of the officers at home all the military districts at home were chronically short of their regulation complements to the extent of 20 to 50 per cent During the war these districtshave been practically denuded of officers on the active list and duty has only been carried on under difficulties by the employment of retired officers and a large number of civilian surgeons which latter having necessarily no army status placed the discipline of the hos pitals in grave jeopardy The total number of medical officers on the active list is at present about 900 This may be contrasted with an establish ment forty years ago of about 1150  remembering further the facts that during these years the strength of the regular army has been increased at least 25 per cent  while the militia which then had a medical service of its own has now prac tically none and is entirely dependent on the attenuated regular medical service The present medical establishments both in officers and men are notoriously inadequate for the efficient carrying our of peace duties and cannot provide for the mobilisation of one army corps without dislocating the duties at home sus pending foreign reliefs and absorbing all margin for waste or casualties The chief part of the foreign service of medical officers is naturally passed in India where over 300 are con stantly employed with British troops  but service in India would really be popular if the Government of that country acted with fairness and liberality which unfortunately ifc does not as will be mentioned under the head of pay But the wants of India are indeed intimately bound up with undermanning of the Royal Army Medical Corps for the inter dependence between the latter and the Indian Medical Ser vice steadily grows greater in proportion as India becomes  base in Eastern wars as exemplified in the present China ex pedition It may be mentioned that through that expedition the Indian Medical Service in both its civil and military branches is at present seriously embarrassed Such facts must not be lost sight of in any augmentation of the medicaB services IIIPay It cannot be doubted that the pay of the junior ranks of the Royal Army Medical Corps is inadequate both at home and in India whether it be viewed in relation to inevitable ex penses or to the scale of remuneration which young medical men can command in civil life The element of supply and demand must be kept in view and it must be remembered that the army as a career for young medical men has to compete at once with a more liberally endowed Indian Service a relatively better paid Naval Service and recently increased remuneration in civil life Since the abolition and prohibition of unqualfied assist antships in civil life qualified juniors receive salaries as assistants or locum tenens from 25 to 100 per cent greater than they did a few years ago The feeling among young medical men on the question of army pay may be stated as follows They reason that bring ing as they doto the service of the State a lengthened com plete and expensive professional education the most expen sive and exacting as recently shown of all the learned professions they have a right in such employment to py which shall from the first enable them to live in reasonable comfort  but this is impossible without private means whether at home or in India Inadequate pay presses on juniors quite as much or more in India than elsewhere a fact the more damaging to the popu larity of the Army Medical Service inasmuch as the greafc majority of junior medical officers spend a large portion of their first years of service in that country they are handed over to the Government of India about their second year and cannot help themselves The attitude of the Government of India for many year towards the financial aspects of successive medical Royal Warrants has been most shortlighted and regrettable Ifc seems hardly creditable that the automatic increase of medical pay under the rank of major in India is still based on a warrant long obsolete and on a scale fixed nearly forty years ago  A result is that a lieutenant of the Royal Army Medical Corps who becomes a captain after three years doe not get the pay of his rank until he has completed five or six years service Again when the important semiadministrative tank of brigidesurgeon was created with increased pay by the Royal Warrant of 1879 its financial consequences were long absolutely igoored in India with the result that not a few of the rank retired early rather than serve in a false and unrequited position Certain limited concessions in the pay of medical officers in India have indeed of late years been made but chiefly in connection with the depreciated rupee and certainly not sufficient to invalidate the broad statement that the financial provisions of several Ryal Warrants have not been given effect in India The ffilare to do so has no doubt deterred medical candidates from the army who justly reason that as such service would entail many years in India they had better spend it in the higher paid Indian Medical Service IVOrganic and Administrative Reform Such reforms must be initiated on the responsibility of the War Office  but the salient points requiring attention are as  follows  1 The active list of the officers and men of the Royal Army Medical Corps should be increased sufficiently to meet a the ordinary peace duties connected with the regular army and militia at home and abroad  b to be of a strength always available at home to meet the sudden mobilisation of two army corps for service abroad without at the same time 54 nSgS GERMAN MALARIA

which will no doubt prove a difficult matter 3 Due reserves of hospital equipment and stores must be kept up  these were officially declared to be very deficient at the beginning of the war 4 Pay must be increased and readjusted especially in the junior ranks both at home in the Colonies and in India 5 Larger autonomy should be conceded to hospital trans port in the field and fuller powers given to medical officers to acquire hospital equipments and supplies in emer gency 6 The SurgeonGeneral of an army in the field should be on the staff of the General Officer Commanding in Chief always in close and direct communication with him instead of on the line of communications 7 Medical officers acting in superior appointments should foe gazetted to a step in local or temporary rank as in other branches of the service GERMN MALARIA EXPEDITION Professor Robert Koch head of the German Malaria Expe dition has sent a sixth and final report of his investigations to the Colonial Department of the German Foreign Office The following is a translation of the report which is published in the Deutsche medicinishe Wochenschrift of November 15th1  We started on our homeward journey from Herbertshhe on August 6th The line of steamers newly established by the North German Lloyd which go from Sydney by New Guinea to Hong Kong calling at the Caroline and Marianne Islands offered the opportunity of investigating those islands and as far as the short stay admitted of taking a glance at their anitary conditions Mainly on this ground I chose this line for the home journey and I was able on August 12th and 13th at Ponape and on the 17th at Saipan to make researches in which I was assisted by the Government Medical Officer Dr Girschner No Malaria in Caroline or Marianne Islands At Ponape not only at the seat of Government Colonia but in six other places situated at some distance in all 79 children were examined for malaria In no single one were the characteristic marks of malariaenlarged spleen and the presence of malaria parasites in the bloodobserved This leads me to conclude with certainty that this island is free from malaria It is said that for a long time only one case of dysentery had occurred According to the statements of Dr Girschner the skin diseases so extraordinarily widespread in the South Sea and framb sia which is frequently con founded with syphilis seem to play no great part on this island At Saipan among 24 children examined there were likewise neither swollen spleens nor malaria parasites Therefore this island too is free from malaria Framb sia in the South Sea Among the many persons pointed out to me as suffering from syphilis lupus and leprosy there were none suffering from any of these diseases What was mistaken for them was framb sia a disease which appears to be very common at Saipan This malady called by the English yaws is extra ordinarily widespread in the South Sea In the Bismarck Archipelago I have seen places in which almost all the the children were affected therewith Even the children of Europeans occasionally suffer from it Very often framb sia is mistaken by laymen and even by medical practitioners for syphilis and I feel warranted in assuming that the statements as to the great diffusion of syphilis in the South Sea and particularly in the German colonial region are based on the confusion of syphilis with framb sia It is much to be wished that a medical man thoroughly conversant with syphilis and skin diseasesif possible a specialistshould be sent out to Dutch New Guinea in order to make a closer investigation of the relations of these diseases and the skin affections which are so extraordinarily frequent in the South Sea Peculiar Disease at Saipan At Saipan there also occurs a peculiar disease which in its course and symptomsfever and lasting paralysis of indi vidual limbsis suggestive of beriberi Of cases of this kind brought to me one was the subject of hemiplegia others of articular and muscular rheumatism There was not a single case of beriberi among them On the whole I got the impression that the health condi tions of Ponape and Saipan are very good inasmuch as there is no malaria in these islands and except for framb sia they appear to be free from other tropical diseases Malaria in Egypt From Hong Kong we proceeded by the main line of North German Lloyd steamers to Suez where the journey was broken by a short stay in Egypt Our investigations in Egypt were directed to the clear ing up of the contradictory statements respecting malaria in that country This object has been so far attained that in Alexandria several cases of malaria which undoubtedly originated in that city or its vicinity were found and genuine foci of endemic malaria were discovered in Helouan near Cairo and at Wadi Natrum west of the Nile Delta in the middle of the desert Stephansort According to the latest news which reached me from Stephansort coming down to August 8th the favourable conditions in regard to malaria described in my previous re ports remain unchanged Maliria Practically Extinct in Germany In order to arrange for a repetition in Germany of this New Guinea research which has proved so fruitful of result Professor Frosch a former member of the malaria expedition has at my suggestion visited many parts of North Germany which appeared suitable for the purpose and made inquiries as to the presence of malaria It has thus been shown that malaria everywhere is rapidly dying out In many places previously known as foci of malaria the disease has wellnigh disappeared In others as for example in the marsh lands on the North Sea Coast it occurs only in isolated cases but nowhere could there be found a focus of malaria suitable for my purpose End op the Expedition Under these circumstances there remains nothing else tobe done but for the present to bring the malaria expedition to an end 1 Translations of the second third fourth and fifth reports were pub lished in the BKiTiSH Medical Journal of February loth p 325  May 12th p X183  June

Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons by Professor Calmette j Director of the Pasteur Institute of Lille In this concluding lecture of the series Professor Calmette I discussed the defensive measures that should be taken for protection against plague commented on the subject of vac cination in connection with the disease and detailed the conclusions he had arrived at concerning individual and general prophylaxis In his opinion it was incontestable that vaccination by heated cultures was capable of rendering great defensive service in times of epidemic In the hope of eluci dating the principal points urged against preceding methods of vaccination he had studied the question last year In the preparation of his vaccine cultures Professor Calmette em ployed a plague virus which originated in Oporto and had never passed through any kind of animal The cultures were placed on gelose in large flat bottles in which after 48 hours there was an enormous microbio development  20 ccm of sterilised water was then added the culture was scraped and the emulsion obtained was poured upon a fine linen filter to separate out the fragments of glose carried away The filtrate was then poured on a paper filter and the microbes left thereon were washed to clear them of adherent I toxin They were then heated in a small quantity of water for The Section Of The

the river This is not sufficient  and so urgent do we consider this matter that we hope before a week is over to see the omission remedied and to learn that a medical officer of health has been appointed to deal with the Clyde shipping not merely during the present emergency but permanently He will have plenty of work and the gain to the shipping community on the Clyde and to the country at large will amply repay the few hundred pounds expended upon so necessary an officer THE SECTION OF THE NAVY ARMY AND AMBULANCE The wide scope of this new Section is well shown in the proceedings which we publish in fall in this weeks issue of the British Medical Journal The papers read chiefly related to the army medical services but the navy came in for a share of attention while under the head of ambu lance were included problems connected with the sick and injured in civil life especially in our great towns It is hardly possible to urge too strongly on the atten tion of the War Office the importance of the papers con cerning the regular and auxiliary medical services con tributed as they are by officers of ripe experience and judgment and discussed by others possessing the same qualifications The discussions can hardly fail to ba of considerable assistance to those who may have to deal with the serious problem of the future reorganisation of these services which we trust will be taken in hand immediately after the termination of the Boer war We hope the scheme foreshadowed in the resolution following Mr Cantlies paper will be worked out without undue delay and placed in the hands of the Minister for War BrigadeSurgeonLieutenantColonel J E Squire grappled with the difficult problem how best to augment medical personnel in the field which of course hinges on the ques tion of reserves He condemned the handtomouth sys tem of mixing up untrained civil surgeons and ambulance men with the regular establishments on the eve of a war  and insisted that all reserves of officers and nurses male and female should be taught in peace something of army organisation and methods and especially should learn the meaning of discipline He expressed a strong suspicion that inattention to these essentials in personnel has had much to do with the grounds on which the alleged failures and scandals in the South African military hospitals have been based Civil units in their proper place may be of great service but should not be recklessly mixed up with the regular army units BrigadeSurgeonLieutenantColonel Peter Giles ex pressed similar views in his scheme for the organisation of volunteer medical units He urged that a volunteer medical officer of sufficient rank should be attached to the office of the DirectorGeneral and under him should inspect and supervise the volunteer medical services In the discussion which followed this paper Mr Frederick Trves as the outcome of his experience during the war advocated that field hospitals should be larger units say 300 instead of 100 socalled beds  this would certainly facilitate their subdivision into more efficient sections when necessary He mentioned that the military and civil surgeons at the theatre of war worked together in great harmony owing largely to the liberal and unselfish way in which the former treated the latter this testimony is all the more welcome considering there have been attempts by the enemies of the medical service to sow discord between them The question of orderlies Mr Trves declared to be surrounded with almost incredible difficulty inasmuch as their duties do not only lie in nursing but in pitching and striking tents digging water trenches and in every way handling the impedimenta of the hospital he declared that female nurseswhose services otherwise are deeply appre ciatedcannot take the place of the male orderly in the field hospitals This will appear to be common sense to all who have any experience of military life or of war He recognised that the formation of a reserve of medical officers is full of difficulty  they must necessarily be young men for it is useless to expect medical men in settled practice to hold themselves available for war services Mr Cantlies paper on how to link the regular and auxiliary forces deserves special attention as coming from a man who is always thoroughly practical in his suggestions He would organise the militia and volunteer medical services on lines if not identical at all events parallel with those of the regular forces  and would link the three branches of the service together just as the several battalions of them are already linked in the Army List His views are likely to be largely embodied in the scheme which is being prepared for submission to the War Office BrigadeSurgeonLieutenantColonel G S Elliston in his remarks on volunteer brigade companies gave some interesting reminiscences of how the floating volunteer regimental medical atoms began to be drawn together into some sort of combination It is liable to be forgotten that their first cohesion was in the Volunteer Ambulance Asso ciation which some twoand twenty years ago originated in the enterprise of Major Maclure of the London Scottish who enlisted the aid and sympathies of such wellknown officers in the War Office as SurgeonGenerals Munro and Mackinnon and their two assistants SurgeonMajors Don and McNalty i The papers on how to adapt bearer companies and field hospitals so as to act with cavalry or

or equipped with light carts on the whole the latter mode seems to commend itself most SurgeonGeneral J B Hamilton dealt trenchantly with the condition of the Royal Army Medical Corps and we

profession has reason to be proud of the fact that two of its members have in successive years occupied the distinguished position of President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science The Association is also to be congratulated on having chosen two such representatives of medical science to preside over its meetings as Sir Michael Foster and Sir William Turner Sir William Turner was born at Lancaster in 1832 and received his medical education at St Bartholomews Hospital London where he had a distinguished career as a student He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1853 and four years later he took the degree of MB in the University of London At the age of 22 he was appointed Demon strator of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh and on the death of Professor John Goodsir in 1867 he succeeded to the chair Sir William Turners work as an anatomist has placed him in the front rank of workers in that branch of science The Transac tions of various learned societies contain many com munications from him and he was also a contributor to the reports of HMS Challenger He is one of the founders and editors of the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology He has been Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh and President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edin burgh In 1889 he was President of the Anthropological Section of the British Association In 1898 he was elected to the Presidency of the General Council of Medical Edu cation on which he had for many years previously repre sented the University of Edinburgh He was a member of the Royal Commission appointed in 1881 to in quire into the working of the Acts affecting the medical profession Honours have been showered upon him from many and diverse quarters The Neill medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh was awarded him for his contributions to Scottish natural history The Royal Irish Academy has conferred its honorary membership upon him and amongst other bodies which have bestowed a like distinction are the Anthropological Societies of Berlin Rome and Paris the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London the Royal Academy of Science of Berlin the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester and the Obstetrical Societies of London and Edinburgh The Universities of Oxford Glasgow Dublin Montreal Toronto and Durham have conferred upon him honorary degrees and he has been elected a member of the Athenaeum Club under the rule allowing the Committee to elect men who have attained eminence in science literature the arts or public service In December 1898 on the occasion of the cele bration of the Jubilee of the St Petersburg Academy of Medicine Sir William Turner was made an honorary member of the Academy The honour of knighthood was conferred upon him in 1886 Sir William Turner is a DeputyLieutenant of the City and County of Edinburgh He has also shown a keen interest in the Volunteer movement He joined the force at its institution in 1859 and for thirty years he held a commission in the Queens Rifle Volunteer Brigade Royal Scots retiring in 1889 with the rank of LieutenantColonel His presidential address delivered this week at Bradford an abstract of which appears at p 690 was worthy of the man and of the occasion I THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON The first meeting of the reconstituted Senate of the University is fixed for October 24th and the last day for sending in nominations to the Clerk of Convocation of candidates for the sixteen seats to be filled by election from that body is the 17th of this month It is anticipated that the election of the new Senate will be completed by October 12th but two more meetings of the old Senate will not improbably be summoned early next month to transact formal business Taere appears to be every prospect of a keen competition for the Convocation seats on the new Senate Two rival organisations are engaged in pressing the claims of their nominees The Association of University of London Graduates which was first in the field with a complete list of candidates in every faculty with the excep tion of that of music is now confronted by the Union of University of London Graduates which during the past week has put forward candidates in Law and Medicine Thus Mr Joseph Walton QC is to be opposed by Sir H H CozensHardy who preceded Mr Walton as Chairman of the General Council of the Bar and was be fore his elevation to the Bench the representative of North Norfolk in the Liberal and Radical interest Sir H H CozensHardy was also the active chairman of the committee of graduates who supported legislation in general accord ance with the report of the Gresham Commission In medicine Dr Ringer FRSand Mr A Q SilcockFRCS are to be opposed on behalf of the Union by Dr J F Payne BScLond MDOxon a member of the present Senate and Dr T Barlow BS BSc Dr Barlows candidature is interesting because he was a member of the Statutory Com mission which framed the new statutes for the government of the University Considerable discussion has already arisen and is likely to increase as the election approaches in reference to the proposal of the Commissioners to concentrate the preliminary and intermediate teaching hitherto carried on at each medical school In their final report the Commissioners stated that they had  come to the conclusion that some kind of concentra tion is desirable7 and they only hesitated to frame a statute themselves for the immediate consummation of the end they so devoutly desired out of respect to the absence of  such consensus of opinion in regard to the mode in which concentration should be carried out as would enable them to do it Representations made to the Commissioners on behalf of the metropolitan medical schools were sufficient to indicate that there are strong ob jections to such wholesale  concentration  as is fore shadowed by the Commissioners and graduates especially those connected with the teaching staffs of the London hospitals will do well to study this question attentively In the musical faculty it is possible that a harmonious arrangement may be arrived at and the handful of musical graduates may be spared the rancour of a contested elec tion Mr J W Sidebotham we understand commands the confidence of a majority of the musical graduates and as he regards the external work of the University as of vital importance and accepts the formula of the Associa tion as to keeping open to all comers on terms of equality aud impartiality all the degrees and distinctions of the University he is pretty sure of election THE PLAGUE IN GLASGOW

the Encyclopedia Britan nica and I apprehend that the writer of the article must have obtained it from authentic sourcesfrom the writings of Fahrenheit himself or from some of his contemporaries His thermometer which I always regarded as an abomina tion is now looked upon by me with a great and twofold interest Its scale being founded on the temperature of the body and this naturally under the duodecimal system receiv ing the round number 12 became the point from which every other number proceeded The paper does not state how the temperature of the body was ascertained  possibly in various ways which accounts for the figures being not quite accurate and not in accordance with the fixed figure on our modern instrument Newton however is careful to say the ex ternal  heat of the body Another Theory of Fahrenheits Scale Some amount of doubt must still remain as to the explana tion of the scale which I have given seeing that no mention of its origin is to be found in scientific books and the account given in Brandes Dictionary of Chemistry is of a totally dif ferent kind althongh the author of the article hesitates in attributing it to Fahrenheit It is said therein  that the 1800 between freezing and boiling was chosen by Fahrenheit or probably Reaumurfor some of his experiments on the expansion of mercury When he plunged his thermometer into melting snow the 11156 parts of mercury which it con tained expanded when placed in boiling water to 11336 being an increase of 180 parts This is said to be the origin of Fahrenheits scale the constructor carrying it still lower when he found he could obtain a greater degree of cold In this account it is not stated why he used this amount of mercury and therefore it can only be inferred that it was the quantity contained in the bulb It is difficult to understand how a scientific man could have adopted so arbitrary a method and therefore probably the description is incomplete It may be remarked that Newton experimented in the same way and his results are mentioned in the paper referred to  he there showed the increased space which 1000 parts of oil occupied when raised to the temperature of the human body or that of boiling water Conclusion I should like to say that I am inclined to put full credence in the account I have taken from the Encyclopedia Britannica as to the origin of Fahrenheits thermometer and although I know that sentiment should have no place in a scientific investigation I cannot but hope that it is correct for I must admit that to a certain extent my wish is father to the thought For the future whenever I see a thermometer in use to mark the temperature of the body I shall be reminded that it was first used for this purpose in order to mark the starting point of the scale from which all other temperatures were to be reckoned At the same time there will be the pleasing remembrance that it was our great Newton who in all probability suggested the temperature of the body as the starting or determinate point in the thermometer and mark ing it by the round number 12  Samuel Wilks HOSPITAL REFORM The Medical Guild Manchester has issued the following report on the subject of hospital reform to the Board of every hospital and dispensary in Manchester  The Medical Guild is impressed with the difficulties surrounding this question but is convinced that reform lies along the lines indicated by the recommendations appended The difficulties lie chiefly in the fitness or otherwise of the various applicants who present themselves at our hospitals The fitness must be viewed from the standpoint of professional or medical exigencies as well as from the point of view of charity The Guild considers that the present methods of investigation through the agency of the District Provident Society and by means of such hos pital officials as are employed are unsatisfactory because the investiga tion is not thorough and is limited to a small area and also because the  poverty scale is not the same for all the hospitals The Guild is further of opinion that by far the greater number of those attending the outpatient department do not require any special treat ment and only waste the time and energy of the hospital staff The Guild considers that the charges exacted lrom patients are wrong in principle and bad in effect The Guild is of opinion that the treatment of home patients does not come within the sphere of the legitimate work of the hospitals and could be better carried out by other means The Guild regrets that a large amount of hospital abuse is due to medical practitioners who particularly in country districts send patients to hospitals who could afford to do without medical charity The Medical Guild recommends  i That the investigation of the financial suitability of the applicants seeking relief at all medical charities should be the work of a Central Board and that in every case in which investigation is decided upon it should be done thoroughly 2 That all trivial cases should be dismissed after the first attend ance and that they and all accidents which should receive firstaid should if not detained as inpatients and if not fit objects of charity receive no further treatment but be referred to other sources 3 That all recommends should be discontinued each application being dealt with on its own merits 4 That the exaction of any payment whatsoever from patients should be entirely abolished 5 That the home visiting of patients should be discontinued and more suitable arrangements made G A Weight Chairman William Graham Convener Abnold W W Lea Secretary OPENING OF THE WINTER SESSION IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS Continued from page 1121 UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON The Medical Society Bias in Clinical Medicine The annual public night of the University College Medical Society was held on October 17th when an address was given by Dr Judson S Bury on Bias in Clinical Medicine who said that many errors in medicine were due to bias The word bias appeared to come from an old French word biais meaning oblique or slanting As a rule it was used to denote a onesided tendency of the mind It was to be observed that the term usually implied error as when it was said that the judgment was biassed When a judgment or opinion was correct it was said that it was good or sound very rarely that it was biassed in the right direction In extreme cases a man was said to look at things in such a biassed manner that the afflicted person might be deemed to possess what Oliver Wendell Holmes called a squinting brain The causes that fixed the mind in one direction often unconsciously closing it to the considera tion of more than one or two aspects were in part congenital and in part acquired In cases of congenital bias the sufferer appeared to be devoid of any power of observation He could see things but could not observe and was unable to analyse and form a judgment on the various impressions received by his senses Acquired bias might affect a mind of good average development  imperfect education was one of the chief causes Scientific subjects were better taught now than formerly but in Dr Burys opinion there was still a good deal lacking in the methods adopted for the training of men for medical work Passing next to the bias of authority the speaker said that he included in that phrase all the statements with regard to disease and its nomenclature to be found in the best medical books Medical knowledge already in their possession while certainly tending to the advancement of medical science acted in some degree also as a retarding agent and a new discovery in medicine might divert the mind too much in one direction and might thus impair the comprehensive view so necessary for real advance Dr Bury illustrated this point by describing in detail the history of peripheral neuritis and declared that the remedy was to strive to acquire a scientific habit of mind Students of medicine would best secure this by passing some time in original research not with the expectation of making a discovery but for the building up of a scientific habit of thought Dr Bury then proceeded to discuss the ques tion of the correctness of the terms curable and incur able disease After quoting some remarkable cases he 14 mbjS2U INTRODUCTORY ADDRESSESOct 20 1900 pointed out that an attack of illness however slight might leave behind it some weak spot which after months or even years might be attacked by a toxin or other irritating agent and become the startingpoint of some chronic progressive dis ease On the other hand severe organic disease was not always fatal for occasionally the morbid process was arrested and in exceptional cases even completely cured The bias of inclination was well exemplified in a certain writer who had collected a number of cases of the disease which he was in vestigating and found that the greater proportion of the fea tures presented by those cases supported a definite view to which the writer himself was much inclined The inclination was to make deductions not simply from the facts observed but from the facts suiting his own expectations and wishes Commenting on the bias of specialism he considered that the throat ear eye and brain specialist should remember the re lation of any particular organ to the other parts of the body The bias of physical signs came last in the list and it was not tobe pretended that a complete examination of any patient had been made till they had studied the chief influences to which his organism had been exposed in the past and had fully considered its present condition together with its capacity for existence and health in the future The impaired vitality and declining strength of a mother who has lost her only child were not revealed by physical signs and chemical tests and could not be adequately treated by drugs  but the doctor who had studied humanity as well as the pathology of tissues would recognise that the mothers mind was affecting her body and would know that kindness with sunlight and change were the remedies to help to keep life going till time had healed the wound Sympathy for suffering was some times as necessary for a correct diagnosis as for successful treatment In conclusion Dr Bury said that the preventive treatment of bias consisted of three thingsnamely care doubt and truth The doubt he referred to was the true scientific doubt involving the intention to arrive at a certainty MEATH HOSPITAL DUBLIN Tuberculosis in Ireland Dr James Craig Physician to the hospital who delivered the introductory address chose as his subject Pulmonary Con sumption in Ireland Dr Craig opened his address by referring to the loss which the hospital had suffered by the deaths of Sir William Stokes and Mr Glasgow Patteson surgeons to the hospital and of Dr Arthur Wynne Foot who had been for twentyone years physician to the hospital previous to his retirement in 1892 Turning to the main topic of his address he said  Prevalence of Pulmonary Consumption in Ireland Nearly 10000 people in Ireland die every year from pul monaryConsumption and these numbers do not include 3000 more who succumb to other forms of tuberculosis Dublin itself with a population of 350000 is responsible for some 1300 deaths per annum and Belfast with practically the same population is a good second with over 1100 fatal cases in the year On an average therefore 24 inhabitants of this city die every week from a disease which is now regarded as preventable Several facts in connection with this astounding mortality are worthy of notice x In England the deathrate from consumption has been showing a steady decrease for the last twenty years whereas in Ireland the reduc tion has been scarcely appreciable 2 The deathrate in London from phthisis is less than onehalf of that which obtains in Dublin 3 The fatalities in our city from a combination of tho principal zymotic or infectious diseases are fewer than those caused by consumption 4 The victims of consumption are chiefly the men and women between 25 and 35 years of age who are the most active workers and breadwinners in the community Dr Craig then referred to the mode in which the disease is acquired and spread and to the necessity for the disinfection of rooms which had been occupied by persons suffering from pulmonary consumption He then passed on to consider the methods which should be adopted to prevent the spread of the disease The teachers he said in the primary schools who them selves will instruct the young must be taught the importance of sunshine fresh air free ventilation and cleanliness in the prevention of consumption The Jubilee nurses afford one of the readiest means of directly carryin into the homes of the poor the information as to the dangerous character of tuber culous expectoration the necessity for ventilation fresh air and whatever isolation may be possible The employers of labour in whose places of business numbers of workpeople are congregated together must see to the proper heating and ventilation of the rooms to the banishment of dust and to the destruction of expectoration Every movement for improving the homes of the poor and every organisation to lessen the waste of money in the con sumption of drink should be encouraged The sanitary authorities should undertake a roomtoroom and housetohouse dissemination of circulars containing prac ticable advice to be followed by persons infected The excel lent principle adopted by our Medical Superintendent Officer of Health to encourage a voluntary notification of the disease and the disinfection of the clothing and homes of those who suffer from or have succumbed to its ravages should be ren dered compulsory throughout the entire country Finally more stringent measures are required than at present exist to prevent the sale of tuberculous meat and milk or their con tamination by attendants who are themselves consumptive Classification of the Consumptive Poor I propose to divide the consumptive poor whose circum stances I desire to discuss into three groups  i Those who in an early stage of the disease offer a fair expectation of cure and are willing to subject themselves to isolation and treatment 2 The consumptives who are the breadwinners of a family and are therefore compelled to remain in their homes and engage in their daily work whUe any strength remains to them 3 Those who in the latest stages of the disease are no longer fit to work and for whom a hope of cure is practically impossible In regard to the first class there is positively no accommo dation provided in connection with this city to which pauper consumptives can look for treatment and a hope of cure I fully recognise the good work which is already being done by the Consumptive Hospital at Newcastle but it is not available to pauper inmates and it contains only thirtytwo beds The second class is a large one The individual probably occupies a room in a tenement house where there is no attempt at reasonable isolation especially by night and so the other members of the family are almost certain to become infected  The case of the third class is the most pitiable of all and represents the final stages of the others The sufferers are no longer able to work are absolutely without means are in the most infective stage of the disease the general hospital is no place for their reception and the convalescent homes in con nection with the city have one and all decided to close their doors against them What therefore are the prospects to which they may look forward for the remainder of their lives  To remain halfstarved in their miserable homes spreading the infection to any members of the household who have still escaped it  in a few instances to gain admission to the hospice for the dying or finally to become unwilling inmates of the union hospital where the conditions however excellent are by no means the most suitable for the amelioration of the symptoms of advanced consumption I do not in the fore going category include the Incurable Hospital for although a most excellent organisation prevails there still it is intended for a better class of patients than I am referring to and a considerable amount of interest is required before admission can be obtained The problem then which confronts usand it is one which the public health authorities in the city must conscientiously endeavour to solveis by what methods the circumstances of each of the three classes whose position I have attempted to define can be most effectively improved Sanatoria Sanatoria however rude should be provide where fresh air and shelter may be available in the treatment of adults and children for whom a cure would be reasonably expected France in addition to several sanatoria for adults has pro vided by private subscription two splendid institutions with 350 beds available for consumptive boys  and over twenty seaside sanatoria very much like our own convalescent homes exist where from two to three thousand children with a con sumptive tendency are capable of being accommodated and restored to health Germany in 1895 had only two sanatoria and two small Opt 20 19001MEATH H03PITAL DUBLINmwJSSai i 5 houses where the poorer classes could be received for hygienic treatment but in the three years which followed nearly thirty of these institutions were established and that too indirectly by the poor themselves  for on account of the law which enforces compulsory insurance against sickness and old age on all whose annual income is less than 150 per annum the insurance companies were quick to realise that the readiest way to save themselves from the disbursement of sick pay was to expend a large share of the premiums they received in the provision of sanatoria for the treatment of consumption The result is that At the present time every large town and every district in Germany has its local sanatoria society and often already its own sana torium Russia was aroused to a sense of its duty in 1895 by a report from the medical practitioners of Petersburg as to the need of sanatoria for the treatment of the consumptive poor and an appeal was made to the public for funds This was followed by the formation of a Society under distinguished patronage to which the Emperor Nicholas II contributed a sum of nearly 50000 for the erection and maintenance of a sanatorium in memory of the Empress Maria Alexandrovna who was herself a victim of consumption and in addition to this he handed over to the Society a large property of his own on which a famous sanatorium has since been placed Many more of these institu tions have been also provided which are supported by indi vidual and public generosity by local rates and by church collections In Noricay the popular present to the King in commemora tion of the twentyfifth anniversary of his accession to the throne amounting to upwards of 100000 was chiefly devoted by him to the establishment of sanatoria for the consumptive poor In that country too I may say in passing compulsory notification of the disease has become law and many useful reforms have been enacted to prevent the spread of the disease Stoitzerland AustriaHungary America the Colonies andin fact every civilised country on the globe is making provision for the proper hygienic treatment of consumption In Ireland what has been done although deserving of the highest praise is microscopic in comparison to the needs of the community Dublin with nearly 1300 deaths in the year from consumption more than half of which are among the strictly poor can boast of the hospital in County Wicklow with its 32 beds which have been provided and are main tained by public and individual generosity aided by the minimum charge of 5s per week which the inmates are called upon to pay  and Belfast with a mortality of 1100 per annum has 40 beds at its command in the hospital which was erected through the munificent contribution of i3ooo by the late Mr Forster Green There the provision for the poor in Ireland who might hope to be cured ends I have no desire to propound visionary or impossible suggestions  on the con trary I am prepared to admit that we must content ourselves with small but gradual improvements The hospital at New castle is capable of great extension let it be supported by every legitimate means known to the charitable public let the ratepayers of the city and county at large be taxed with a small additional sum for this deserving purpose and soon we shall find ourselves in a position to maintain not only 100 beds at Newcastle but several further hundreds in ruder shelters where consumptives among the very poor may not be denied the curative influences of fresh air and wholesome food Housing of the Poor I am beset with apparently insurmountable difficulties when I approach the task of attempting to suggest any cer tain methods by which members of a family who inhabit a single room can be prevented from acquiring the disease when one of their number who has become infected is com pelled to continue to work The real difficulty lies in the necessity for isolation at night The evil would be minimised if due regard were observed in the matter of ventilation the frequent boiling of clothes and the destruction of expectora tion by fire  but as these precautions are almost unattainable it is a question whether it would not be possible for the public health authority either to provide a separate room in the same tenement house in which the infected person might sleep or to set apart special houses which under their own immediate supervision might be utilised by victims of the disease who fear to spread the infection to their relatives This matter I understand is being considered by the Medical Superintendent Officer of Health and a few members of the Public Health Committee of the city but practical suggestions on the subject from other sources would I am certain be gladly welcomed by them The pitiable condition of those who in the latest stages of the disease are past work are probably infecting others and have no prospect before them but the hospice for the dying or the union hospital is that which most directly appeals to myself in my daily work at hospital Homes akin to the hospice are an absolute necessity and the plain duty of the Public Health Committee is to draw the attention of the Corporation to the state of affairs which exists in the city namely that numbers of respectable halfstarved consumpn tives who are a menace to public health require a spot i3 which to end their da vs and for which the union hospit may be considered sufficiently adequate but where they cer tainly are unwilling to die Backward State of Sanitation in Ireland Let me quote the hopeful words of Dr F R Walters tcr whose work on Sanatoria for Consumptives I am much in debted He says in reference to Great Britain Our countrys sanitary past has been great and fruitful and there is every reason to hope that with growing consciousness of the possibility of destroying this dread scourge of humanity by the abolition of town smoke the improvement of our dwel lings the better ventilation of rooms and streets the admis sion of sunshine into our midst the inculcation of more rational habits of life the destruction of sputa the erection of sanatoria and in many other ways she will gradually pre pare for herself a still more great and glorious future This bright picture I am sorry to say does not extend to Ireland for the neglect of sanitation is undoubtedly the cause of our great mortality from consumption  nor are the prospects for the future so encouraging as they might be The condition of the city of Kilkenny as given to the public a few days ago does not tend to diminish the stream of emigration from our shores or engender much hope for improved sanitation in the futureno proper water supply no system of sewerage cocases of diphtheria in the past year typhus and enteric fever always prevalent and the Urban Council ignoring for years the reports of their medical officers of health and of the inspectors of the Local Government Board as to the sanitary needs of the town I have no hesitation in saying that the action of the Govern ment in the administration which is again about to take office is responsible for the neglected condition of sanitary reform throughout Ireland The promoters of the Local Government Act of 1898 obstinately refused to put this country on an equal footing with England or Scotland They refused to accede to the representations of the Irish College of Physicians to render it even permissive for county councils to appoint medical superintendent officers of health over a county or a group of counties who as experts and independent of private practice would have in conjunction with the existing medical officers of health done more in one year to establish efficient sanitation throughout the country than can ever be effected by the present organisation Dr Craig then referred to the fact that the two clinical medals offered by the medical staff of the hospital had been won by lady students and to the prospects of ladies now enter ing the profession  QUEENS COLLEGE BELFAST Address by Dr McKisack The winter session of the medical school of the College and various teaching hospitals has opened It is too early to be able to judge the probable number of entries The medical professors delivered their opening lectures on October 16th and the classes were well attended  on the same morning the formal opening of the session of the medical school was made at the Royal Victoria Hospital when Dr McKisack delivered the address and welcomed the students on behalf of the staff His opening sentences struck a note of sorrow when he

42 beds for officers made 478 or very nearly the accommodation of a general hospital at the base 500 beds It was however found that the convalescent wards were a mistake as it was difficult to send the proper kind of cases for hammocks from the numerous hospitals upcountry It was then decided to convert the convalescent wards of all the hospitaL ships into wards with fixed cots and to

314 beds It should be mentioned that the beautiful little yacht Golden Eagle owned by Sir S Scott Bt was attached to the Nubia and accommodated 3 or 4 officers who were kindly looked after by Lady Sophie Scott and her maid a trained nurse When Colonel Gallwey CB the able Principal Medical Officer of the Natal Army formed the idea of fitting up hospital ships he hit on the only way out of 4he tremendous difficulty which had to be faced by the rapid development of what was thought would be a short campaign into a very serious and big war There was great difficulty in establishing land hospitals not only by reason of the impossi bility of getting buildings cooks etc but also the feeding and supply which could much more readily be arranged on board transports with full establishments than lying idle in the roads The rush of wounded and sick was so great at times that it was absolutely necessary to find means of evacuating the field and base hospitals further up The Nubia received wounded direct from the battlefields on everal occasionsfrom Spion Kop Potgieters Pieters and from the fighting into Ladysmith After relief she received many of the sick from that town and took some home She was at the Durban base from January 5th to March 31st when she left for England with a full load of wounded and sick Some idea of the work done can be gathered when it is men tioned that during the above period about 1500 noncom missioned officers men and officers passed through the ship Of these one officer and six or seven men only died chiefly from enteric fever and dysentery contracted in the field Large numbers of both sick and wounded passed up to the front again having recovered rapidly  a considerable number were invalided being shattered by the hardships of the cam paign Nothing could have exceeded the cleanliness of this magnificent ship and it is a pleasure to feel that from first to last everyone pulled together with the greatest

have constantly been despatched home with invalids more or less convalescent showing the importunt part taken in this campaign by hospitals afloat THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR By a South African Campaigner XXIII The Winter Climate op the Transvaal The climate of the Transvaal is at the present season cool and bracing although on the high veld which our forces now occupy the cold at night is often severe That the present season is winter and not summer in the Transvaal is still more fortunate for the health of the Boer forces and those British prisoners whom they have removed into the low country north of Pretoria From Pretoria northwards the country falls away to the valley of the Limpopo or Crocodile which forms the northern boundary of the Transvaal The country is broken by spurs of mountain and deep valleys and is largely covered by bush of a semitropical character Through the winter this district is healthy and the climate mild and delightful It is the low veld of the Boers and is resorted to every winter by farmers dwelling on the high veld who with their flocks and herds their families and waggons periodically migrate to the low veld during the winter months In moving to this district at the present time of the year the Boers are therefore merely following their usual practice although the conditions are materially altered The Lydenburg District In the early days of the settlement of the Transvaal Lyden burg was made the headquarters of the emigrant Boers and the Lydenburg Republic was one of the first Governments which existed in these territories Fastnesses to the north end of the Drakensberg in the immediate vicinity of Lyden burg offered ideal natural fortresses to which the Boers could retire after engagements with the surrounding Bantu tribes I once spent a few months in these mountains at the end of the winter and the beginning of the summer My tent was pitched on high ground and the entire camp of settlers around me were healthy but I can well recollect even so early as September seeing many virulent cases of malaria among men who had been prospecting for gold in the surrounding deep valleys on either side of the mountain range As a matter of fact during the summer under existing circumstances the large portion of the country intervening between Pretoria and Lydenburg is unhealthy to Europeans and the amount of malaria which occurs is considerable It is the fever of the summer months which has made the exploitation of the gold fields of the Zoutpansberg a northwestern spur of the Drakensberg both hazardous and costly Among these mountains is to be found one notorious laager known from the earliest days as the Ohrigstadt laager This interesting and fertile valley shut in in the mountains was described a few weeks ago by a correspondent of the Times of Natal who predicts that the old Bechuanaland free booters Adrian De la Rey Van Pittin and others will eventually retire there to join Abel Erasmus the Transvaal native commissioner in that district Here it is anticipated by this correspondent the last stand will be made On the merits of this programme from a strategical point of view it is not our province to comment but it must be borne in mind that such situations as these are surrounded during the summer months by large belts of terribly unhealthy country The Boers will thus be cut off from the outer world unless they are prepared to face malaria whenever they sally forth Water Supply and Sanitation on the Rand Typhoid which has played such havoc among our troops in the various camps is unfortunately only too common under what have hitherto been normal conditions in Johannesburg and at the various mines along the course of the main reef As the deep level mines are opened up and the population of Johannesburg increases the question of an abundant and pure water supply not only for Johannesburg but for the whole course of the reef will have to be faced One of the commonest causes of typhoid fever has hitherto been the continuous use of water from wells and other small local supplies as springs liable to pollution by surrounding surface drainage and by dust There can be little doubt that an abundant water supply from one end of the mines to the other would very materially reduce the high deathrate from typhoid fever The sanitary system in vogue in Johannesburg itself does not differ mate rially from that employed in Kimberley and the majority of other South African towns It is what is known as the pail system and one of the chief objections to it is the nuisance of the night service The huge waggons which are driven through the streets with an attendant train of natives during the small hours of the morning are foul things to encounter The other and perhaps the more serious objection is the ques tion of the disposal of slops which are too often distributed indiscriminately over the back yard if there be one or the adjoining street if there be not Theoretically this system is held to be safe but it is undoubtedly disagreeable and for those who object to a waterborne system of sewage Johannes burg and Kimberley offer enterprising communities and new scenes for the sanitary experts devices Casualties Among the deaths from enteric fever reported from Bloemfontein are Lieutenant C H B AdamsWylie IMS who died on June 2nd and Civil Surgeon H Bryant who died on June 7th Lieutenant AdamsWylie received a commission in the Indian Medical Service

THE GRASS PLAINS OF SOUTH AFRICA THE master mind of our veteran general has no sooner been applied to the task in South Africa than a totally new develop ment has been brought about The war has entered on a new phase and actions are being fought in an entirely new country The whole of the country over which Robertss various columns are now manxeuvring consists of rolling grass plains with only here and there a few kopjes and ironstone ridges dotted on their surface The soil for the most part is sandy and is but loosely held together by grassy tufts which are everywhere separated from each other by considerable in tervals In travelling over this country waggons frequently strike out new paths in the untrodden veld and in places it is quite possible that the huge convoys of waggons each with i6 oxen and each carrying 6ooo pounds weight might travel over the veld five or six abreast The season has been excep tionally dry only a few thunderstorms having occurred and the whole veld is parched and brown In the tracks of waggons clouds of dust arise and may be seen for many miles ascending into the air marking the line of convoys across the plain as smoke sometimes marks in the distance the track of an ocean steamer Th het HEAT EXHAUSTION AND MENINGITIS The beat during the march of the different divisions appears to have been intense and Lord Roberts mentioned in his telegram of February i4th that no fewer than 44 officers and 53 men had been sent on the 13th in return ox waggons to the ilne of railway prostrate with heat exhaustion Heat exhaus tion is a good soldiers phrase and is often described in the tropics by medical men as heat syncope or sun traumatism What the precise pathology of this attack may be it is difficult to say but the symptoms usually are prostration with head ache which usually passes off in twentyfour hours or even less At other times solar fever may follow for a day or two and in some cases of which a few have come under my notice meningitis is produced and terminates fatally The fatai cases which I have seen occurred in natives employed in the open workiDgs of the diamond mines with heads entirely uncovered and exposed to the midday sun and shut off by the surrounding walls of the mine from any currents of air Certain cases of fatal meningitis arose on the diamond fields under these conditions With these exceptions I have never seen more than a few days lassitude follow the most persistent exposure to the sun At the same time during periods of great heat acute meningitis which seemed directly traceable to the action of extremely high temperature sometimes developed among patients suffering from fever and other diseases The Free State plains are at an altitude of about 4ooo feet above the sea level and although hot by day they are almost always cool by night The summer nights on these plains are ideal for bivouack ing in the open with one blanket a hole in the sandc hollowed out for the admission of the hip and a pair of boots or other articles of equipment for a pillow a weary man THE MEDICAL SERVICE OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONTINGENT WHEN that first strange initial blunder of the War Office was made and the offer of an Australian contingent of all arms was declined it occurred to Colonel W D Campbell Williams of Sydney Principal Medical Officer of the Medical Corps of the New South Wales Military Forces that the offer of a medical service unit might nevertheless be accepted It should be explained that New South Wales is the only colony of Australia that possesses a thoroughly organised trained and equipped Medical Staff Corps This is composed of a small number of regulars but the bulk are partially paid The corps was originated by Colonel W D Campbell Williams and is described as  more than up to date The corps is able to provide for a field force of 7000 men One of its notable features is a cavalry ambulance the waggons of which were designed and built to Colonel Williamss plans They are for use with mounted forces in bush country and are able to keep up with a rapidly moving force A great proportion of the medical officers are either surgeons or physicians to civil hospitals and included in their number are the leading surgeons and physicians of Sydney so that it possesses the best medical skill of the colony The organisation of the corps is such that with six hours notice it can proceed to the front with every waggon horsed its own transport stretcher bearers and all stores tents drugs and medical comforts etc complete Colonel Campbell Williamss suggestion was taken up by the New South Wales Government and the cable message sent to this country was to the great gratification of the New South Wales Corps answered by a message that the offer was  gratefully accepted an instance of foresight one among many upon which the DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical Department must many times since have congratulated him self The message accepting the offer was received in Sydney on Monday and on Friday night the Army Medical Corps unit offered a half bearer company and a field hospital complete in every detail on a war establishment was embarked It included 93 men of all ranks 49 horses 5 ambulances Io transport carts and 2 water carts with all the ordnance and medical and surgical stores as laid down with in addition a fine reserve store of drugs Roentgen ray apparatus etc This is certainly an achievement upon which Colonel Williams is to be eongratulated and was rendered possible only by the state of preparedness in wbich the New South Wales Medical Staff Corps was kept and by the goodwillby whichtbeenergy and organisimg

ten or fifteen miles occurs between one small fountain and another DE ATHS FROM DISEASE Mt Wyndham in reply to an inquiry stated in the House of Commons that among combatants approximately 5o8 deaths from disease had occurred in South Africa 240 from enteric lever and 268 from other causes If we deduct from these losses those resulting from epidemics of typhoid fever and dysentery in Ladysmith it will be seen that the actual losses asustained by the whole of our forces cannot be described as great As a matter of fact the Free State has a thoroughly healthy climate in which our men are likely to remain fit and well unless quartered for long periods of time in camps where the water supply is insufficient and typhoid fever is allowed to become established AMBULANCE WITH IRREGULAR CORPS My attention has been called to the medical corps attached to the New South Wales contingent which is reported to have excellent provisions for ambulance attendance in the field and an inquiry has been sent me as to whether the Colonial forces will be similarly equipped with medical requirements A gentleman recently returned from Chieveley where he has been some time with Bullers force tells me that pro vision has been made for supplying surgeons to the irregular corps and that a considerable amount was collected among South Africans in London for supplementing some of the necessaries for such equipment My informant added that pyjamas were badly needed by both the Colonial forces and the regulars not for use in the field but for the use of wounded mnen brought into the field hospitals from the frout He told me that while he was there many such wounded were brought in and that after slitting up a mans khaki jacket or breeches as the case might be and attending to the wound there was considerable difficulty in getting anything to put on The anatter is worthy the attention of some of the numerous or ganisations for sending out articles of clothing for the troops While on the matter of clothing for the troops it is well to note a comment in the letter of my Capetown correspondent which appeared in the last issue of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL PLEURISY AND PNEUMONIA AMONG RECRUITS He says many cases of pleurisy and pneumonia had been ad mitted to the base hospitals at Capetown from men only just landed from the transports This is a distinctly unfortunate state of things and is due my correspondent thinks to the fact that the men were obliged to go barefooted on board ship I cannot believe this practice is in vogue on all troopships but can readily understand that the khaki cotton which many of the men are provided with and which I have seen them wear on raw December days on the docks at Southampton may prove a very poor protection during the first half of the voyage and also in the case of a southeaster off the Cape In some instances I am told that our men had no cloak whatever No troops should be sent without cloaks and for the mounted men there is nothing to beat the regulation blue cavalry cloak Blue bytheby is a better colour for this cloak than khaki In South Africa itself the cloak will only be worn on picquet duty at night or in camp Atnight the dark cloak is less conspicuous than the khaki would be One of the City Volunteers a wellknown lawyer died of pneumonia on the voyage out and I fear that he was a victim to insufficient clothing during the voyage One of the peculiarities of the new campaigner or amateur traveller is the passion for unnecessary hardship and many young fellows going out with the yeomanry and volunteers require a certain amount bf restraint to prevent them from hazarding their health by recklessly undergoing unnecessary exposure which they erroneously believe will have a hardening effect but which as a matter of fact actually costs at any rate a small number of lives LADYSMITH From Ladysmith an extremely interesting account of the state of affairs has recently been published by one of PReuters war correspondents who escaped from that town n February ioth Stores still seem to be fairly abundant but luxuries and vegetablesare at faminepiices Mr Hutton says that continual diet of horses and mules was getting somewhat monotonous Further on we read that the live stock still included 4ooo horses 700 mules and 650 cattle At first one is disposed to wonder why with 65ocattle men should be eating horses and mules The explanatiop perhaps is that the little grazing obtainable more easily keeps the cattle in condition than either the horses or the mules Cattle therefore willlast longeri and possibly in addition give a certain amount of milk v There is something almost ludicrous in the idea of mule sausage The mule has been described as a being who has neither pride of ancestry nor hope of posterity to inspire him he is a quegrtepnpered brute and we have not yet forgotten that he bolted with the guns at Nicholsons Nek Nevextheless as a vegetable feeder the mule should be quite eatable and apparently does afford at least a nourishing diet The sickness in Lady smith is evidently on the wane and although thecondition of the garrison is undoubtedly a hard one there i eFtill every reason to suppose that Ladysmithcan if necessry hiold its own for a considerable time to come for such time n fact as may be necessary for the pressure of Lord Robhertss oolumn in the Free State to compel the withdrawal of a large portion of the Natal Boer fQrces andthna relieve the pgg beleagured town In faot we may confideptly anticipate that if byno other means the positions round Ladysmith will be takenas were the positions at Magersfontein by a move ment which compelled the withdrawal of the forces occupying them THE SCOTTISH HOSPITAL IT has been decided at a public meeting held in Edinburgh tQ open a fund to provide and maintain a hospital for the sick and wounded soldiers in South Africa The leading medical and surgical authorities in Edinburgh are giving their cordial support to the scheme and are to assist in securing mecical officers and nurses Although the hospital will be Scottish in origin and equipment its services will be available for the sick and wounded of any nationality The object is to aid the Army Medical Department in its efforts to inlieve the sick and wounded in connection with the war We understand that the cost of the hospital is expectedtobe about 12000 and that a large part of that sum has been subscribed or promised The preliminary staff appointments will be made this week A WELSH HOSPITAL IT has been decided to equip a Welsh hospital and at a meeting held at the house of  Sir John Williams on February 218t

medical officers were presented to him The Duke then in a short speech congratulated the staff on having the oppor tunity of serving their Queen and country in South Africa Though the news recently received had been more cheering he still feared that there would be many occasions for them to render services both to the wounded and to the sick and he congratulated the donor of the hospital Mr John Langman on the noble gift which he had made to the nation Mr Lang man subsequently entertained the Duke of Cambridge the medical staff of the hospital and a party of friends to

without giving the British Medical Asso ciation an opportunity of being heard by a small deputation A reply was received from the Lord President ol the Council to the effect that the statement would have the Duke of Devonshires best attention This was reported to the meet ing of the Council in October last and referred to the Parlia mentary Bille Committee At the meeting of this

HUMANITY OF THE PRESENT WAR Delivered at St Georges Hospital on May 1st 1900 By CLINTON T DENT MC FRCS Surgeon to the Hospital We are all I suppose a little prone to assume that what is new to us is necessarily new to everyone else  and that of what we have lately learned others must necessarily be ignorant The mere fact that I mention such a truism may however be taken as a proof that I do not share in the belief In this South African campaignrather prematurely called in some quarters the Transvaal warthere are so many features of novelty that even the most cursory sketch of some may prove of interest I do not o course lay claim to any profound knowledge or experience of gunshot wounds  and in drawing comparison with the results of other wars I have been compelled to resort to books and statistical reports Fortu nately military medical statistics relating to losses in wars are uniformly reliable  and indeed are given with a merci less thoroughness As far as regards the present campaign I have had a fortunate experience for in the course of the past few months I have I suppose seen between 2000 and 3000 wounds nearer the latter figure I suspect than the former It is easy enough to waste time for war provides endless distrac tions and excitement but during my time I stuck closely to work throughout disregarding even the fascinations of Cape town Everywhere as I moat gratefully acknowledge I re ceived the utmost courtesy and the utmost attention from high civil officials from staff officers and from the medical officers of all ranks To them my very warmest thanks are due My experience was principally if not almost entirely limited to the base hospitals and the stationary hospitals It is there after all as it appears to me that the civilian is best placed There one can judge deliberately of organisation as a whole or of medical details  and it is certainly there that free from the hurry and rush which are absolutely inseparable from work nearer the front one can best study gunshot wounds and best watch the effects and results of treatment My mission was a twofold one  first to study the whole army medical organisation as it was working on a large scale in this present war  and the other was to learn all I could about the fleets of gunshot wounds inflicted with the most modern weapons Army Medical Organisation You will pardon me if on the first of these matters I pre serve silence beyond making the one remark that it appears to me to be premature at present either to endorse or to ques tion the criticism that has been made in some quarters of the army medical organisation as a whole or on the other hand to j join in the somewhat fulsome or at any rate full stream of eulogy and praise which is in other quarters lavished on the entire department Efficient it isthat much I will say more efficient beyond all question than any army medical organisation that has ever been in any campaign of any magnitude yet But I hope that that will not prevent us in the future from striving to make it much better The Humanity of Modern Warfare It is often said that this is a humane war I am disposed to take the remark as a sort of text for my lecture and to con sider from a broad standpoint the auestion of the humanity of this war That statement is chiefly founded on the fact that modern smallbore gunshot wounds display remarkable fea tures  that wounds do well  that operations do well  and that many of the recoveries that have taken place are un doubtedly very remarkable Professor Bruns anticipated as the result of a series of ex perimental observations made a few years ago that the next war would be a humane one The experiments were made on the dead bodies of men and horses Bullets were fired into them at known ranges and the effects were noted The weapons used were smallbore rifles On the other hand theorists like M Bloch in that remarkable work of his Is War Now Impossible f takes absolutely the opposite view He thinks war will be so inhumane that it will be impossible Here we have contrasted the prophetic views of the practical man and of the theorist I suppose that judging by experi ence of the present campaign in the whole history of litera ture no theory has ever been more astonishingly wide of the fact than that of M Bloch has proved itself to be One is re minded of an old remark of Ambroise Par at the end of his treatise on gunshot wounds  See gentlemen how I learned to treat gunshot woundsnot by books Ambroise Par did not underrate his own superlative merits  but he was a great and a wise surgeon and recognised that there was but one way of gaining real knowledge of this class of injuries Indeed while the theorist is hopelessly wrong the experi menter has already been shown to be very frequently far from right in his views There are other factors of the first importance to be taken into account besides the effects of these s tnallbore bullets To these factors I wish first to draw attention But before passing on I may say at once that it has been abundantly proved in the present war that the view is a correct one that the great majority of wounds are inflicted by rifle bullets and do not result from shell Are  that is borne out beyond all question Septic Diseases My point however is that the humanity of a war is not to be gauged solely by the nature of the bullet wounds From the broader and purely surgical point of view a war is humane or not according to the answer to be returned to this question  Are there or are there not present the great class of septic disorders such as pyaemia erysipelas septicaemia hospital gangrene tetanus osteomyelitis and the rest We know that these diseases are really preventable Have we succeeded in preventing them  If they are absent from my present point of view it may be regarded as a humane war  if they are present as an inhumane one Hitherto and I desire to emphasise the fact stronglythese diseases j have been almost if not entirely absent in this war I cannot  recall having seen a case of pyaemia or tetanus or  hospital gangrene or osteomyelitis A satisfactory condition of affairs i you will think Such it undoubtedly is  and yet I wish at once to touch a discordant note and to state my decided im pression that in some parts of the seat of war wounds are not now doing quite so well as they did at the outset To this I will allude again later on Meanwhile I wish to draw your attention to the various factors that have contributed to the exceptional results that have hitherto been obtained One is the condition of our men The sea voyage to the Cape told all in their favour Of the weak and weedy striplings who I had been assured formed the bulk of our army I saw hardly any examples If they were put on board the transports in England they had been got rid of before the troops were landed at the Cape I saw regiment after regiment disem bark almost uniformly the men seemed a vigorous and healthy lot The regiment in particular that I went out with the Second Lancashire Fusiliers were a remarkably fine set of men for the work in hand The troops had as a rule been I well fed on board and they have to say the least been ade quately nourished on shore The good feeding of an army is of enormous importance We may have in this campaign ignored to our loss some of the Napoleonic maxims but the authorities have realised to the full one of the utmost value to the effect that  an army moves on its belly Commissariat and Transport Now if one depattment may be praised unreservedly in this campaign more than another it is certainly the com missariat department The way they have done their work is marvellous It seems to me that such a department has its full share of blame when things go wrong but that it does not get its fair meed of praise when things go right And on this occasion things have gone right To those who have been working in hospitals this has been abundantly clear The progress of a case of sickness and the behaviour of a wound form a very delicate test of a mans condition As an instance of the difference that it makes whether men are well or ill fed take the case of the Lad y smith garrison On January 30th 1900 there were out of the Ladysmith garrison in Intombi 205 5I gIQ m5LbK5SaiTHE HUMANITY OF SMALLBORE BIFLESMay 19 1900 and in Ladysmith itself over 2500 sick and wounded in hospitalsay onesixth of the force disabled through sick ness and wounds This condition of affairs was largely owing to the short rationsand the rations were short and un commonly bad  there is no harm in saying so now All the more honour to the garrison who stood it all Diseases complicating wounds were not much in evidence The diseases that the medical officers have chiefly had to contend with are in the first place enteric But the enteric is of the most terrible type that I have ever seen Probably not far short of 30 percent of its victims died Then there was dysentery in its various forms some of it very mild much of it not dysentery at all There was rheumatism to some extent but comparatively little malaria save amongst the soldiers who came from India or who had seen service in malarious districts elsewhere There were probably far more cases of pneumonia on board the transports on the voyage out than in the hospitals in South Africa where the disease was but seldom seen Another factor is the transport If the transport is bad or if the conditions under which the wounded soldiers are con veyed back to the field stationary or base hospital be un favourable the cases are likely to do badly On the whole the transport has been good Sometimes the conditions were very trying as for instance after the Spion Kop action where after the men crossed back over the Tugela to Spear mans Camp they had twentythree miles of rough country to traverse in dhoolies or ambulance cartsbefore they joined the railway line at Frere There was the same trouble after the action at Vaal Kranz and after that at Pieters Hill when the final relief of Ladysmith was effected Again the battle of Paardeberg was fought a long way from the railway line and the nearest stationary hospitals at Kimberley In all these instances the difficulties of the return journey and the difficulties of transport were very great The condition of the wounded soldiers on arrival was proportionately bad At the extreme front the conditions were good Never I suppose have more efficient and courageous stretcherbearer companies been organised than in this war It may be gathered that they were not easily kept in order Many of them were refugees from Johannesburg and suchlike places All agree that the way they would go out under fire to fetch in the wounded men and the rapidity with which they would get them back to the hospital were deserving of the very highest praise It would be very seldom that the ordinary stretcher bearer companies could be got to show the courage under fire that these men did on many occasions  so the wounded were got back from the field quickly The ambulance trains did their share of the work well The Cape Government Bail way officials worked with a will On the Natal side that extra ordinary organiser Mr David Hunter the general manager of the Natal Government Kailways worked the transport with astonishing smoothness Consequently the wounded were given every chance to do well The Climate The climate was absolutely the strongest point in our favour Consider in Natal alone the heights at which the hospitals were Maritzburg where the great central base hos pitals are placed is at a height of 2200 feet above the sea Ladysmith itself is 2300 Estcourt 3000  and one of the best hospitals in South Africa that at Mooi Biver which is No 4 General Hospital the altitude is 4500 feet In the matter of climate no more perfect place for a hospital than Mooi Biver could well be imagined The climate whether in Natal or in Cape Colony appears to be surgically almost sterile a point of the very first importance The same holds in Cape Colony the hospitals stand high From a few hours after leaving Wynberg the railway mounts up by a steep incline and on to the high veld a huge tableland which stretches away over the Karoo for hundreds of miles until the slope begins to fall again towards the Zambesi You therefore have a huge elevated dry plateau the veld at a height of 4000 and 5000 feet In this warm dry climatesometimes very hot in the middle of the day and very cold at night but dry and with a sandy sojlthe openair method of treatment can be practised to an extent that I confess at first staggered me One saw patients lying in the hospitals in the marquee tents with the door flaps open and the tent looped up all round with the windows open and the dust if there was any wind  and there generally is wind  blowing through but nothing bad ever came of it The patients could be dressed or undressed or operated on for that matter practic ally in the open air and yet if due precautions were takei against unnecessary chilling no harm followed The Hospitals If one thing was proved more conclusively than another in the Crimean war it was the necessity for air space and light in hospitals and the experience of this campaign has borne it out The chief medical authorities have taken this lesson at least fully to heart and their wisdom in so doing has been proved to the hilt Whenever the climatic conditions permit I should give the preference to tents of whatever pattern they be rather than to huts even in base hospitals Huts are necessarily more close Public buildings churches schools and the rest are far less suitable The wide distribution of the hospitals was another highly advantageous factor In Natal the hospitals are spread over 180 miles and between Cape Colony and Bloemfontein the line of communications dotted over with hospitals is 750 miles long In South Africa good sites for hospitals can be found everywhere Contrast with that the condition of things in the Crimea where it was hardly possible to find a suitable place to pitch a hospital in the whole peninsula Another feature of the campaign itself from the military point of view has been in favour of the medical men at the hospitals At no time has there been any severe strain on the hospitals There have been a series of sharp engage ments it is true  but these were fought for the most part at distinct intervals and over a large tract of country The strain was thrown equally on two separate hospital systems one in Natal the other in Cape Colony Lord Methuens battles at Belmont Graspan Modder River and Magers fontein followed it is true quickly one after another When I first went out there were some 1100 wounded in the base hospitals at Capetown practically all of them coming from the Modder River district But though this aggregate was fairly large the patients had not been all at once thrown on the hands of the medical officera There had been oppor tunities of partially clearing the hospitals in front and the wounded had been sent down in batches In Natal I question whether at one time a strain such as was anticipated could have been adequately met There is no harm in saying so now when the fighting in Natal is obviously over A request had been sent down to get ready at least 5000 beds when the advance was first made on Lady smith However as it turned out there were a series of engagements fought and so the hospitals were never overcrowded Antiseptic Treatment With regard to antiseptics this is really the very first war of any magnitude in which the antiseptic system has been used on a large scale In the RussoTurkish war it was employed on a small scale but with the most admirable results by some German surgeons The results are even better in this war There has been an abundance of surgical materials and the organisation has been well managed so that all the materials of one kind are not crowded into one place and all those of another kind into another place The various packages have been intelligently made up so that for example the whole of the chloroform has not been sent into Natal while all the cyanide gauze was sent to Cape Colony Preposterous mistakes of the sort have before now occurred in war even with English officials at the head of affairs Dressings were lavishly supplied and were lavishly not to say extravagantly used Still I take it the British taxpayer will not mind that In certain details on the other hand needless economy seemed to be observed While the amount of dressings used in the hospitals was perfectly astounding there appeared to me to take a single instance to be a most singular parsimony with regard to the issue of nailbrushes apparently insignificant but yet really most important articles in a surgical ward or operating theatre The medical men had often tb provide their own Those who know some thing of the peculiarities of military methods are aware that it will take you quite as much trouble and possibly quite as long to get a nailbrush as say 500 extra bedsteads All the Mat 19 1900I THE HUMANITY OF SMALLBORE RIFLES BtoSLwoSS  men were supplied with field dressings  of the value of these I cannot say much but I have no doubt they did some good The dressings in the field hospitals were always abundant but necessarily in the field hospitals the minute details of the antiseptic system cannot be very thoroughly practised With regard to the practice of the antiseptic system throughout this campaign I hardly know what to say per haps it will be best at present to say no more than this  that it is abundantly clear that the elaboration of detail which is found absolutely necessary in a London civil hospital may be and perhaps is pretty often dispensed with out there under less favourable conditions of climate and of the other sur roundings  have mentioned they certainly could not have been disregarded with equal impunity Yet it must not be supposed that all wounds heal by first intention there and that everything goes on in the best possible way in the best of all possible climates Suppuration was common enough almost from the first and it became more abundant as time went on Many cases of compound fracture came down to the base hospitals suppurating very freely It is not likely that the behaviour of wounds will improve Indeed I think it is getting rather worse  it is worst on the Natal side where the climate is not quite so good and some of the hospitals are getting somewhat worn from use Of course the progress of a fracture depends very greatly on the amouot of disturbance of the parts rendered inevitable by transport But I saw nothing beyond suppuration with high temperature when pus was locked up in a wound or when sloughs were separat ing from a wound So soon as the offending part was dealt withamputated if necessarythe temperature sank and the case did well Of pysemia and septicaemia one saw noth ing and of tetanus nothing whatever  I do not believe there has been a case yet With regard to erysipelas until yesterday I would have said that there had not been a case of erysipelas  but only yesterday I received information of the death of a young officer whom I saw in Natal from whom a bullet had been ex tracted and who died I regret to say according to report from erysipelas The circumstances I do not yet know but I must say it seems to me that even if it be a single isolated case it is still of very grave import I only heard of this long after I had thought upon the subject and ventured to predict that the cases were not doing so well and that the staff must keep a sharp lookout for graver septic complications In some of these the cases are very septic  the sept ici ty was not matter for much surprise For example there were some Boers who had been wounded at Paardeberg in the Kimberley Hospitalan admirable hospitalwho were not received until a fortnight after the action Two of them had compound com minuted fractures of the arm involving the elbow So far as I could learn the only dressings they had applied had been tobacco juice with tobacco leaves over the wound They pre served their limbs but whether in consequence of the tobacco juice I cannot tell you Indeed I believe they preserved their limbs chiefly by declining altogether to part with them Ultimately although at one time the cases did not look at all hopeful they were on the mend The Proportion of Wounded to Killed Professor Billroth writing only a few years ago about the next great war was convinced that there would be an increase in the number of wounded owing to the adoption of smallbore rifles He thought too that the proportion of severely wounded would be very greatly increased That anticipation has not been borne out The proportion of killed to wounded up to the present in this campaign is about the usual oneabout one killed to four wounded It has often been much higher than that In the RussoTurkish war the proportion of killed to wounded on the Russian side during the assault of Plevna was i to 21 There as you will remember the attack was made on an enemy in very strong position the condition of affairs that has obtained in most of our engagements Deaths prom Wounds The mimt er of the deaths from wounds is however much more to the point On this topic I must say a word even at the risk of wearying you with figures for on the  deaths from wounds the health of the troops in the campaign may be determined the efficiercy of the hospital evstem esti mated and from my point of view the humanity of the war gauged It is not merely by the severity of the wound that a particular bullet inflicts or by the amount of laceration that it entails that we should judge We must first take into account wounds which are necessarily mortal but in which it is possible to transport the patient to hospital These are comparatively few In this war as in others those who are not killed at once by some such injury as smashing up of the skull or injury to the spinal cord high up die if they die in the field of haemorrhage Of the wounds which are likely to be returned as  mortal  we may take some but very few to be of the head Either the man is killed at once or there is a likelihood of recovery A large proportion of abdominal wounds prove fatal perhaps 40 or 50 per cent The same may be said of injuries of the spinal cord but after a distinct lapse of time after they get into the hospital Wounds of the bladder have shown bad results in this campaign  and necessarily also bad compound fracture of the femur high up But with regard to all the rest if a man can get into the hospital wounded he has a chance of recovery unless he dies of one of those septic disorders That is abundantly proved by the returns officially furnished It is a curious fact that up to a certain date in March we had 4934 wounded taking non commissioned officers and men alone Now in the Franco German war the Fourteenth German Army Corps up to a par ticular date had 4344 wounded The numbers are very similar Of these 4344 Germans 617 died  and of our 4934 239 died Put into percentages it comes roughly to this  a mortality of 44 deaths from wounds  amounting to 5 per cent in our army and in the Fourteenth Army Corps to 14 per cent Of the 617 Germans who died 304 died of pyaemia and septicaemia and 39 of tetanus If we exclude then these preventable dis orders the mortality in the two armies is almost the same namely 5 per cent in our army and 6 per cent in the German army corps This result is eurely very striking and very instructive Shell and Shrapnel Wounds And now with regard to the humanity of the wounds I have nothing to say about shell wounds  they are very much as before Comparatively few men are killed by themat any rate it is a very costly way of destroying or attempting to destroy your enemies More are killed hy shrapnel But it is abundantly clear on both sides that shell and shrapnel fire and especially the missiles from quickfiring machine guns have a widespread demoralising effect on the troops Bullet Wounds Let us consider only the smallbore rifles Of course 44smallbore is only a relative term The calibre of the Mauser is 7 mm or 0275 of an inch and that of the Lee Enfield 77 mm or 0303 of an inch As regards efficiency there seems very little to choose between the two rifles It is of the bullet that I wish chiefly to speak The core in both consists of hardened lead covered over with a mantle or en velope The envelope in our bullet is made of copper nickel in the proportions of 80 per cent of copper and 20 per cent of nickel The diameter of the bullet is 0311 inch The diameter of the Mauser bullet is 0284 inch The bullets are therefore so to speak larger than the bore of the rifle barrel As they are forced through by the explosion they  take the grooving  and the rifling of the barrel imparts the movement of rotation in the longitudinal axis of the bullet I want you particularly  to notice as shown by the sections l  Fig the relative thickness of the  k sheath or mantle The sheath of the ifia Mauser bullet is of steel nickel ed rHu over Ours as already stated is of HB copper nickel There is no need to weary you B with minute details The main B point is that in modern rifles there H is an exceedingly high muzzle ve H locity Roughly the bullet leaves KB the muzzle of the Mauser rifle at dB a rate of About 1500 miles an hour IMP which is pretty rapid going at rMy CJ 1300 yards the velocity works out at between 800 and 900 miles an hour The muzzle ve locity of our rifle is rather lower than that of the Mauser 3 The Humane Side Of WarfareSource The British Medical Journal Vol 1 No 2057 Jun 2 1900 pp 1365136620264722 1215 June 2 190aSIGNING BLAJJK

CURE OF CAPE HORSE  SICKNESS Amongst other matters brought into prominence by the war in South Africa is the disease of the horse known as  Cape horse sickness As the nature of the operations renders mobility essential and the transport of men and material depends on the health of the horses employed the subject is of special interest and importance at the present time Though the morphology of the causal factor  has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated and many points in the pathology of the disease remain for elucida tion it has been long known that the blood of an affected j animal is virulent and retains its power of inducing the disease for long periods outside the animal body under apparently adverse circumstances The disease is pro duced both by ingestion and subcutaneous inoculation of such blood and it is fully recognised that certain localities are especially dangerous Methods of prevention based on this knowledge have been adopted with varying success It is now most commonly believed that if horses are not allowed to graze on the veld in the dangerous dis tricts until the herbage has been dried by the sun they will probably escape the disease Notwithstanding all that is known of prophylaxis Cape horse sickness remains a matter of the utmost concern The exigencies of warfare often render adoption of the ordinary preventive measures impracticable Anything therefore which would render I the horses body an unsuitable soil for the virus would be a great desideratum hence the announcement in the Cape Times of April 24th 1900 by Mr George C Purvis MD BSc late Medical Assistant to the Bacteriological Institute Grahams Town of a method of preventing  horse sickness  and of effecting a cure in the majority of instances will be read with interest Dr Purvis alludes to the dangerous effects of fortified serum derived from immune horses and describes his single experiment on a horse He states that we started by injecting subcutaneously 20 ccm of serum  the next week the animal got 50 ccm the next week 75 ccm the next 100 ccm the next week 150 ccm and about a week after 200 ccm Fourteen days after 1 ccm virulent blood was given and the horse did not show any symptoms of horse sickness whatever  The serum used was obtained from the blood of horses which had received a dose of virulent blood some five or six weeks or even longer before the blood is drawn for serum It is unfortunate that Dr Purvis has not been able to publish more than a single ex perience of his method This is hardly to be regarded as a solution of the fundamental questiondoes the iojection of serum confer immunity  Until this point is settled by a muchextended experience it is scarcely advisable to consider the practicability of adopting it as a prophylactic I measure It is to be hoped that Dr Purvis will subject his method to a much more convincing test than that now adduced and that the publication of his results will mark a step in the advance of useful knowledge on this subject j SIGNING BLANK MEDICAL CERTIFICATES A recent prosecution at Leeds for making and giving a medical certificate of the cause of death of an infant which was false because it had been signed in blank by one prac titioner while the cause of death was filled in by another practitioner who had never seen the infant is of some im portance The prosecution was instituted by order of the RegistrarGeneral and the following were the facts of the case  An infant died in Leeds fourteen days after it had been attended at the Leeds General Dispensary and the mother on application at that institution for a medical certificate was furnished with one by the locum tenens of the medical officer of the dispensary for which purpose he used one of several forms which the medical officer had signed in blank and left for use during his absence The local registrar on the production of this certificate elicited from the mother who came to register the death that the practitioner whose signature the certificate bore had not seen the child for fourteen days and therefore reported the case to the coroner who held an inquest thereon at which the circumstances of the case were fully investigated Subsequently the case was reported to the Registrar General who instructed the Superintendent for Leeds to prosecute for making and giving a false certifi cate in contravention of the provisions of Section xl of the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1874 At the adjourned hearing of the case the Leeds stipendiary magistrate while recognising that the defendants had no improper motive in making and giving this certificate expressed the opinion that the RegistrarGeneral deserved the thanks of the public for instituting the prosecution He decided however that the case would be met as the RegistrarGeneral did not press for heavy penalties by fining the medical officer 2 for signing the blank form of certificate and his locum tenens 1 for inserting the cause of death of the infant whom ne had never seen The grave objections to the practice of leaving signed blank forms for medical certificates for use during the absence of the certifying practitioner it is unnecessary to dwell upon and the result of this recent prosecution ought to be widely known THE HUMANE SIDE OF WARFARE Dr Nicholas Senn in a recent number of the Journal oj the American Medical Association says that the most pleas ing features of modern warfare are the efforts made in all civilised countries to make it more and more humane The horrors of Sebastopol Gettysburg Solferino Sedan and other great battles during the present century will he thinks have no equal in the future Governments and nations are beginning to realise more fully the import ance of providing the soldier with food and clothing con ducive to the preservation of his health and bringing into effective action sanitary rules calculated to guard against preventable diseases After referring to the beneficent work of the Red Cross and other philanthropic societies he says that the neutral grounds near the line of battle on each side are the places where thehumane side of modern as compared with ancient warfare is most vividly exhibited He describes a few instances of the kind which happened during the late SpanishAmerican war during his service in the field a chief of the operating staff A few days after the battles of El Caney and San Juan he was invited by Dr Goodfellow to accompany him on a trip to El Caney and from there to the Spanish line as instructions had been received from headquarters to transfer a number of wounded Spaniards across the American line The Spanish officers whom they met were welleducated and polished gentlemen While waiting for the ambulances cigarettes were freely passed around and all kinds of subjects out side the war were freely discussed in the shade of a group of palm trees About the time the ambulances arrived a Spanish surgeon with 30 hospital corps men and the necessary amount of litters made his appearance According to Dr Senn the Spanish compared very favourably with the American litters He says that there can be no longer any question that the Spaniards respected the humane side of warfare although during the war the American press frequently took occasion to state the con trary It was asserted that the Spaniards did not respect the Red Cross and that wounded and noncombatants under the protection of the Red Cross flags were frequently fired upon Dr Senn has reason to believe from what he saw during his service in Cuba and Porto Rico that these statements were made on altogether insufficient grounds  6 ttgSSaJ COLONIAL NURSING ASSOCIATIONJone 2 1900 It is true that medical officers litter bearers and wounded men on stretchers who were being conveyed to the rear were killed and wounded but such accidents will occur during any battle as long as the firstaid dressing is carried out as it should be near the fighting line The modern small calibre weapon sends the deadly missile a distance of three miles and injuries to noncombatants within this range are unavoidable He adds that the small Red Cross flags used in the field cannot be distinguished with the naked eye for anything like the distance travelled by the modern bullet No gross violation of any of the articles of the Geneva Convention can he affirms be laid at the door  of the Spaniards Perhaps one of the best proofs that the Spaniards conducted the war on the most humane prin ciples is to be found in what occurred during the first skirmish after the landing of the American troops in Porto Rico A small Spanish force occupied the summit of one of the foothills and opened fire The American troops charged and a young private of one of the Pennsylvania regiments in his enthusiasm advanced far beyond his line The day was extremely hot and when he came within a short distance of the brow of the hill he fell unconscious A Spanish surgeon immediately rushed forward to render first aid administered stimulants and had the soldier at once conveyed on a stretcher to the American line Another very pleasing evidence of the humane nature of recent warfare came to Dr Senns knowledge at Mayaguez Porto Rico After a somewhat lively skirmish near the suburbs of this place the enemy retreated and the wounded from both sides were conveyed to the same hospital He found the Spaniards on one side of the large room and the Americans on the other all of them being under the care of the same nursing sisters of a Spanish order who in their ministrations made no dis tinction between friend and enemy It was interesting to observe how the men who but a few days before did their utmost to kill or wound each other were now on the most friendly terms They exchanged little articles of comfort such as tobacco cigarettes fruits and relics of the war in a manner that did not recall the experiences of a few years ago It is pleasant to have such irrefragable testimony borne to the conduct of the Spaniards in the late war for it may be remembered that certain of the American news papers persistently held them up to the execration of man kind for their alleged disregard of the rules of civilised warfare Such charges are sure to be made in the heated state of national feeling generated by a war When the j history of the present struggle in South Africa comes to be written in cold blood even the Boer will doubtless be painted in less lurid colours than he now is by writers whose patriotic ardour makes them  see red or yellow PROFESSIONAL SECRECY IN THE UNITED STATES The Newhaven Medical Association has lately had the question of professional secrecy under consideration It appears that in a recent trial in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut a medical practitioner of good standing was compelled to answer against his protest a question relating to knowledge obtained by him in a pro fessional communication from his patient The decision of the Court was based upon the common law rule at pre sent governing such cases in the State According to this law while the confidential communications of a client to an attorney shall be considered as privileged and shall not be disclosed as testimony in the Courts the confidential communicatios of a patient to a medical practitioner or of a penitent to a priest or other clergyman shall not be deemed privileged and must be divulged in the Courts as testimony The State of New York some years ago passed a statute overruling the commonlaw rule and this statute has since been adopted practically without change by seventeen other American States and territories The Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New York provides that  A person duly authorised to practise physic or sur gery shall not be allowed to disclose any information which he acquired in attending a patient in a professional capacity The Newhaven Medical Association being of opinion that the discrimination against medical men and clergymen regarding confidential disclosures under the commonlaw rule is against the best interests of public policy and of society urges that the rule of common law should be overruled by the enactment of a statute similar to that of New York State A REPENTANT SCHOOL BOARD The School Board forfLondon have appointed Robert J Collie MD Medical Superintendent of the Boards Am bulance and Home Nursing Classes The number of pupils who received instruction in ambulance and home nursing last winter was close on 10000 and the Board has decided that all ambulance classes shall be taught by medical men assisted by the Boards teachers Each course consists of twelve lectures given alternately by the medical man and the Boards teacher As we an nounced last week the Boardwhich for the last two years has offered only half a guinea for a lecture lasting one hour and ahalfhas now advertised its willingness to pay one guinea a lecture Whether this change of remuneration is due to the reported difficulty in obtaining registered prac titioners at the smaller fee or to the recent appointment of a medical superintendent we cannot say but it is a matter for congratulation that the Lomdon School Board has ceased to set so bad an example to other Boards It must at any rate be admitted that the fee of one guinea is by no means too much when it is remembered that the lecturer has no allowance for travelling expenses and pro bably has to spend about three hours in earning the remuneration offered We are informed that until recently the pupils were presented for examination by the St John Ambulance Association but that the Board have now de termined in future to grant their own certificate THE COLONIAL NURSING ASSOCIATION The report presented to the annual meeting of this Asso ciation at Stafford Home on May 23rd over which Earl Grey presided showed that 56 nurses sent out by the Asso ciation are now at work in the Colonies  39 in Government employment and 17 engaged in private nursing The gain to the Colonies more especially Crown Colonies where hitherto natives mostly coolies have constituted the nursing staff by introducing skilled British nurses is wellnigh in calculable Medical men in the tropics are hampered by the want of efficient nurses and the good already done in providing nurses although considerable is but infinitesimal when the enormous field for their services is considered Tropical ailments are often so sudden in reaching a crisis that the medical man often finds that he is tied to the bedside of a single patient for a day or two during which time be has both to treat the patient and to nurse him The inconvenience caused to other patients the detriment to the welfare of the patient by the same person acting as doctor and nurse and the tax on the strength of the doctor is a serious matter in a district where perhaps no other medical man is within call Sir George White who was present at the meeting strenuously advocated the provision of trained nurses for India and for the Colonies We would however urge the importance of having nurses trained even it may be par tially in nursing tropical ailments before leaving home At the Seamens Hospital London and at Liverpool a course of training for nurses about to proceed to the tropics is now given and we have no hesitation in impressing upon the Colonial Nursing Association the advantages of drawing their nurses only from amongst those who have had such training Of the 5000 required 2000 has already been South African Hospitals CommissionSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2066 Aug 4 1900 pp

the cardiac action of chloroform In an animal to which amyl nitrite had been previously administered chloroform no longer gave the great fall in blood pressure SOUTH AFRICAN HOSPITALS COMMISSION At the first meeting of the Commission held on July 24th after the opening statement by the Chairman Lord Justice Romer which was published in the British Medical Journal of July 28th the first evidence taken was that of the Director General of the Army Medical Service who gave particulars of the working of his department and the arrangements made in time of peace for future wars He said that every demand made for South Africa up to date had been met There had been ample supplies of doctors nurses beds and medical appliances  but he could not say whether the doctors and appliances sent out had been properly distributed He had not in his official capacity received any complaints of any special hospital Next came the AssistantDirector of the Army Medical Service who stated that the medical service was in respect of transport at the mercy of the Army Service Corps or rather of the General After some further evidence from departmental officials LieutenantColonel G Sterling Ryerson of the Canadian Army Medical Staff expressed the firm conviction that the best that was possible in the circum stances was done for the sick and wounded At the second sitting on July 25th the Rev W H Orford who was attached to a hospital in Bloemfontein said there was no overcrowding The nursing was all done by orderlies who worked splendidly He had never heard any complaint from the men either at the hospital where he was for two months or at two others in which he was With regard to vermin he said that if a new brick building was put up even upon new ground in South Africa it was immediately infested Sir Howard Vincent MP who visited several hospitals said the arrangements were beyond all praise He heard no com plaints even from the men of his own regiment who would have spoken freely to him Mr Watson Cheyne also spoke well of the medical arrangements He was inclined to think the epidemic was not typhoid or atleast that a great deal of camp fever had been mixed up with typhoid No neglect of the sick or wounded came under his notice An immenee amount of the energies of the medical staff was wasted in ad ministrative and clerical work Next came a trooper of the CIV who had himself been in hospital and who said that as far as he knew there was no want of attention either at Bloem fontein or at Wynberg A full report of the evidence is given below SurgeonGeneral J J Jameson DirectorGeneral of the Army Medical Service said that with regard to the constitution of the department in reference to preparing for the care of sick and wounded there was a per sonnel of officers and men for two army corps and a cavalry brigade In ease of war being threatened the AdjutantGeneral communicated with witness stating where the war was to be and the strength likely to be engaged He was then desired to submit a proposal which would after wards be discussed by the Army Board as to the medical requirements Including the percentage of beds required In unhealthy climates the estimate ranged from 10 per cent to 25 per cent of the total strength Then he prepared a memorandum showing the probable diseases likely to be encountered the kind of supplies and provisions to be obtained and everything connected with the sanitary part of the campaign He also furnished all the medical officers engaged with a memorandum showing them what diseases they would have to contend with and how to obviate them and the necessary sanitary precautions The memorandum which had been prepared for the present war dealt with temperature rainfall winds precautions required on account of climate and the following prevailing diseases Enteric fever dysentery diarrhoea malarial fevers parasitic diseases ophthalmia and pneumonia Imme diately the war broke out it was found that the medical personnel for two army corps and a cavalry brigade were exhausted The number of medical officers in South Africa on September ist 1899 was 32 During September 19 were sent out in October 138 in November 102 in December 38 in January 1900 44 in February 48 in March 50 in April 10 in May 8 and in June 19 making a total of 508 This month 20 more were being sent out The figures did not include the medical I officers of colonial contingents Every demand for South Africa up to I date had been met There had been ample supplies for the sick and I wounded of doctors nurses beds and medical appliances He could note I say whether the doctors and appliaDces sent out were rightly distributed I in South Africa He then read the following note on the state of the sick and wounded at Bloemfontein on April 27th Mr BurdettCoutts de scribed the condition of a field hospital at Bloemtontein which he con siders should have been equipped as a stationary hospital His descrip tion relates to April 28th On April 27th there were at Bloemfontein the fol lowing fully equipped hospitalsNos 8 9 and 10 General Hospitals the Langman the Portland the Irish and No 5 Stationaryabout 2000 beds in all with considerable capacity for extension There were altogether 2291 patients in military hospitals at that date 873 being cases of enteric There were about six field hospitals of which all but one had to be pre pared for war at anytimeNone of the returns describe any want of satisfaction with the arrangements He had not received in his official capacity any complaints of any special hospital and only an unofficial1 complaint with regard to the Woodstock Hospital Lieutenant Colonel Johnson Assistant Director of the AMS gave details as to sending out of hospitals and nurses and pointed out the great distinction between military hospitals and civil hospitals He I added that the medical service had not its own transport which was per haps a weak point in its organisation They were at the mercy of the Army Service Corps or rather of the General Major W G Macpherson Deputy Assistant Director AMS gave statistics and returDS with regard to sanitary matters and also dealt with the actual extent of the outbreak of enteric and other diseases in the army and the preventive measures adopted in the present war He said I it was intended to supply Berkefeld filters in the proportion of x to every I 100 men but that had not been completely carried out because the I manufacturers were unable to fulfil their contract The hospital system I depended on its ability to constantly remove patients from the field hos Eitals to the base hospitals and thence to the transports There had een no delay in emptydg the base hospitals As many as 2coo men a I week had been landed in this country Up to July 17th 26758 men had I been invalided home The deaths reported from enteric were now going I back to the normal point The deaths for the week ended July 14t I would represent 38 per cent per annum The deaths reached their maxi I mum on May 26th The medical officer in charge of No 9 General Hos pital at Bloemfontein drew attention to 1000 cases of enteric fever up to the date on which he wrote with a casemortality of 12 per cent LieutenantColonel J S Cowans DeputyAssistantQuartermaster General gave details as to transport and said every requisition for extra medical men had been complied with General Sir Henry Brackenbury DirectorGeneral of Ordnance stated that he was charged with supplying allarms and armaments neces sary for the conduct of war together with hospital equipment including tents beds bedding stretchers and waggons but not medical or surgical stores He was not aware of any complaint having been received From South Africa as to either insufficiency or quality of the hospital equip ment In his opinion the reserve of hospital equipment previous to the outbreak of the war was totally inadequate There was to his mind a great lesson to be learned at home as to the necessity of having in hand a very large reserve so as to be able to meet all demands during the first six months of a campaign so as to be independent of the  trades He dicD not think however that the slightest suffering had been caused to the troops by such delays as had occurred The wituess then gave particulars as to the hospital arrangements prevailing at home in peace time The army was organised into certain units and each had its stores and hos pital equipment at the centre of mobilisation In addition there was the question of reserves  and as a matter of fact just before the war broke out they had a reserve of only one base hospital of 520 beds and two 1 stationary hospitals of no beds each That was on September 29th when the Government gave orders for preparations to be made to send out additional equipment There were at that time sufficient stores for field hospitals for three army corps but they had no reserve equipment for stationary hospitals or base hospitals except those already mentioned Colonel J Steevens CB Principal Ordnance Officerwho was next called said that he did not receive orders to proceed with the preparations until October 4th Directly the order was given he set men to work day and night filling beds with horsehair that had to be purchased hurriedly and in that way they were able to send the equipment by the transport on the date fixed There was one delay in sending out base hospitals from December 9th to January 6th That was owing to their having sent out all the ambulance waggons they possessed They received during March a message to send out 300 beds and bedding and while that order was being carried out the War Office ordered 2oco beds to be despatched to South Africa  both requests were complied with as quickly as possible Delay had arisen in a case in which 500 beds of a particular pattern were requested  and it was found necessary to import them which in his opinion was a mistake  Sir Ralph Knox Permanent Undersecretary for War said the Army Medical Department had no executive authority but according to what was required in the field had to go to one of the four high military officers of the War Officeeither the AdjutantGeneral the Quartermaster General the Inspector General of Fortifications or the Director General of Ordnance and while speaking generally all its applications were granted they were usually referred to the Army Board The preparations of all the responsible departments were based on the assumption that for a war of attack or of defence it was necessary to send out two army corps and a ravalry division giving an aggregate of about 90000 men At the same time their prepara tions were framed in respect of a third army corps at home but they were on a more moderate scale Replying to a question respecting the delay in getting the base hospitals ready the witness said that as a matter of fact the Government had not in July or even in August made up its mind as to what would have to be done As to suggestions or complaints of delay or insufficiency of hospital equipment and transport for hos tal purposes the fact was that the Army Medical Department desired hat all medical matters in the field should be under their direct control and in a large measure that was so in the present campaign Of course the difficulties of transport had to be taken into account and the main transport had to be maintained even though the medical transport suft 302 nBjSOUTH AFBIOAN HOSPITALS COMMISSIONAug 4 1900 Cered in consequence So far as he was aware the War Office had not received any complaints respecting the management of the hospitals beyond those contained in Mr BurdettCouttss letters LieutenantColonel G Sterling Ryerson Canadian Army Medical Staff Toronto stated that he was in South Africa from February 15th to July 44th in the capacity of Red Cross Commissioner and his services ranged over a wide area first commencing at the Orange River and then including work in the hospitals at Kimberley Bloemfontein and Kroon stadt At the first place on February 20th he found between 500 end 700 sick and wounded chiefly i a adjustable huts but some were in tents All appeared extremely comfortable as regards beds bedding and medical and general stores There were 47 Canadians in the hospital and if they had had anything to complain of they would have told him From Orange River he went on to Kimberley and remained three or four weeks visiting the hospitals daily The Modder Bridge had been destroyed and it was therefore difficult to get supplies p owing to the convoys having to traverse steep declivities which really resembled toboggan slides or chutes and a whole day was occupied in overing the forty miles from Orange River On one day 523 sick and wounded arrived at Kimberley With so large a number of men suddenly thrown upon them it was impossible to provide them with such luxury as was obtainable at say the Hotel Cecil  but they had all that was neces sary to render them as comfortable as was possible in the circumstances He himself furnished 90 cots from the Red Cross funds the cots being made by the De Beers Company There was abundant medical and nursing strength and the hospital stores were well supplied except in respect of fresh milk which was very scarce He next proceeded to Bloemfontein And Kroonstadt At the former place there were between 3000 and 4000 sick and nothing could have surpassed the arrangements made in Parlia ment Buildings for the comfort of the men after the first week or two while in the Roman Catholic Convent and St Michaels Home everything was perfection and the nuns made splendid nurses It should be borne in mind that the communications had been cut and that there was only a single line of railway to convey supplies for about 50000 men and that three days and three nights were occupied in the journeys which were usually covered in forty hours Notwithstanding all these difficulties he saw nothing to complain of There were plenty of stores and the hospitals rere at liberty to draw upon the Red Cross without restraint The number of men arriving was extraordinary  one afternoon 564 arrived and the next morning another 354 What would the London hospitals do if 10000 patients were suddenly thrown upon them  He was firmly convinced that the best that was possible in the circumstances was done for the sick and wounded although he had not read the letters referred to he remem bered seeing Mr BurdettContts in Bloemfontein but did not hear of any complaints being made to him At the second sitting of tne Commission held on July 25th the Rev W H Orford said he was born in South Africa and was in Bloemfontein from the entrance of the British troops until Lord Roberts went north He was mainly attached to the hospital which was established in his old college of St Andrews It was undoubtedly one of the worst in the district because it was an old building and was one of those chiefly criticised It was quite true that patients were lying on stretchers and mattresses and in some cases it was impossible to undress them for a fortnight There was no overcrowding There were about 60 patients in the hospital but there were no nurses The nursing work was all done toy orderlies who did their work splendidly The greatest difficulty they had was in getting fresh milk The food was of good quality They had sufficient blankets He had never heard a word of complaint from the men though he had constantly asked them if there was anything they wanted In reply to the Chairman the witness said there was only one par ticular in which they missed the nurses and that was that the men did not obey the orderlies so well as they did the nurses He was nearly two months in the hospital but the condition of things he had described lasted only about a fortnight  within that time they got everything they wanted He was in two other hospitals There was very little difference toetween these two hospitals and the one he first mentioned tie had never heard any complaint about these two hospitals He was not con nected officially with any hospital but he was acting chaplain and in that capacity was a person the men were likely to confide in He had never seen any men lying in the mud and had no reason to believe that oldiers refrained from complaining lest they should get into trouble In reply to Mr Frederick Harrison the witness said the wounded came crowding in from Paardeberg He did net see men lying about when they first came in though he heard that men were lying about for thirtysix fiours up the Glen but fighting was actually going on He believed the removal could not be managed for military reasons He had often slept on the ground himself without a mattress In answer to further ques tions the witness referred to the question of vermin and insects in South Africa and said that if a new brick building was put up even upon new round it might immediately be infested He went on to point out that the Bloemfontein Waterworks had never yet been completed The filter beds had never been finished and they did not depend upon them for their water supply In a very short time after the occupation the engi neers had bored all round the town and good water was found at a depth of 50 feet and taken to the hospitals Sir Howard Vincent MR who was the next witness stated that he arrived in South Africa on January 23rd and visited in the first place the Portland Hospital in the suburbs of Capetown on the 25th He thought it was admirably arranged in every way He passed on to No 3 General Hospital one of the large general hospitals which had accommodation for about 500 or 600 patients He went thoroughly through that hospital and saw the cooking operations and conversed with many of the patients In no hospital marquee were there more than x6 patients As to the general cleanliness order and comfort of the hospital it was beyond all praise and he heard absolutely of no complaints He subse quently made a full examination of No 1 General Hospital at Wynberg He saw the reception of the patients He was struck with the extraor dinary method Colonel Grier had established in order to trace out not only the medical but the private history of each man Although he might seem to speak in terms of exaggeration he could only say that the Arrangements were beyond all praise He did not hesitate to say that from the laymans point of view overcrowding was much less than be had een in any London hospital He went into the Boer hospital ward and there he received the only complaint made and that was Commandant Pretorius He also visited No 2 Hospital close by on the same day and again on March 5th when he was quite alone He said there were two men of his own regiment in the hospital and he conversed with them and they would no doubt have spoken to him if they had had complaints to make On February 14th he had an opportunity of going round the whole of Sir Kedvers Bullert army and seeing the provision made for taking away the wounded from the fighting line Everything was done that could pos sibly be done and it was remarkable to see with what skill the medical department took up their dressing stations There was however always a tendency on the part of bearers to linger a little when they got tired As to the red cross on the waggons he did not think it was sufficient in dication as it was difficult to see it at a long range The Boers painted their ambulance trains white He was at Chieveley the best part of a week and he went amongst the officers and men and it would be impos sible on anything he heard to found any substantial complaint Then he visited Sir William Gatacres column at Sterkstroom There typhoid was very prevalent and there were three or four wards of bad enteric cases He did not ascertain that there was any real cause of complaint that could be avoided He arrived at Paardeberg on February 27th He was able to see the hospitals there and also the arrangements for carry ing the wounded from Paardeberg to Modder River and he was bound to say that it was to be regretted that the number of ambulances in the bearer company were reduced in order to obtain extra mobility The complement of the bearer company was ten ambulances and these were reduced by the exigencies of the moment to two That was a very bad time because a convoy had just been captured by the Boers and there was great pressure He visited the general hospital at Kimberley and it was as good as any hospital in London After leaving Kimberley he again visited the hospitals in Capetown and he heard no complaints from any of the men in his own regiment or the members of the CIV who all perfectly well knew that he went out to see if he could do any thing to improve their condition Taking all the exigencies of the case into consideration he could not speak too highly as to the general arrangements Mr Watson Cheynesaid that he had visited several military hospitals in South Africa There was no real trouble about the sick and wounded Of course there was overcrowding in the field hospitals and they were short of equipment The sick were attended to and were being sent back to the base hospital Being out in the open did not affect the patients a bit for it was a beautiful time of the year They ran rather short of dressings but the medical comforts were all right The only hardship was the long distance the men had to be sent back in ox waggons They could not expect a large proportion of army medical men to be good surgeons any more than among civilian surgeons As to the orderlies it was generally remarked that the St John Ambulance men were not good owing to their want of training but the surgeons and noncommissioned officers were very good The witness went on to say that at Drietfontein they had proof that the ambulances were insufficient in numbers Ambulances had been left behind partly in consequence of the exi gencies of the advance and partly in the hope that they would not be required He was at Bloemfontein till April 20th or 21st During the greater part of that time the enteric epidemic was at its worst but he believed there were more cases in May Within fiveldays of reaching Bloemfontein Colonel Stevenson had arranged accom modation for 500 or 600 sick He called in once or twice to see cases in the tents They were as crowded as they could be About April 20th they had had over 300 deaths in a 50bed hospital He went away then for a few weeks and when he returned there had been 400 There was a point which he thought the medical members of the Commission might consider and that was how far this epidemic was one of typhoid fever The great majority of cases recovered in ten days or a fortnight and there were other characteristics which made him think it was not typhoid As soon as Bloemfontein was left there were hardly any cases but at Kroonstadt it broke out again The great bulk of the cases occurred about ten days after Paardeberg but he thought a great deal of camp fever had been mixed up with typhoid There were two or three nights when it poured with rain with the result that tents were flooded The Portland Hospital was certainly flooded but he did not think there were any men in it at the time He had seen men lying on the ground but never in the mud He had never heard of a man who did not get the rations prescribed for him He had heard the story of orderlies selling the food to the patients but no soldier had ever complained to him of such a thing He thought I they would certainly have complained if they had such a grievance He I thought all the men knew who he was He started without a uniform but I he found it was very inconvenient as he was constantly being arrested for I going to places where it was thought he ought not to have gone The I soldiers out there all understood the difficulties of the situation and he I did not think anything was left undone He thought everyone I tried to do his best in fact they were very enthusiastic in I their endeavours to maintain the reputation which they believed I the Army Medical Service had acquired The orderlies did their I best Many of them were untrained men and if their best was I not good that was another matter There was a great deal of I sickness among the orderlies themselves No neglect of the sick and I wounded came under his notice in any way In answer to Dr Church the I witness added that in his opinion an unnecessary amount of the time of I the medical staff was taken up in administrative and clerical work which I clerks ought to be employed to do It took something like two hours I every day to clear off the medical reports and returns An immense I amount of energy was wasted in this way I Mr Morgan a trooper of the City Imperial Volunteer Mounted Infantry I lately returned from South Africa said he fell sick at S annas Post He I was treated with every possible kindness at Bloemfontein The medical I staff did the best they could for the men when they got into No 9 General I Hospital So far as he knew there was no want of attention During the I eight days he was there the doctor visited him twice a day and there were I nurses and orderlies He was also in hospital at Wynberg about four or I five days He was very much astonished at the amount of attention given I to them He never heard anyone complaining out there Everyone had I spoken well of the medical men who attended them and be had heard no I complaint of the want of medical comforts South African Hospitals CommissionSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2072 Sep 15 1900 pp 76176220265707 1210 Sept 15 1900

that he and other holders of his office had been afraid to burn their fingers by attempt ing to remedy ita plea which if held sufficient might pre vent the remedying of almost any injustice that had existed for half a century Consequently not only has nothing been done but the present Home Secretary has even refused to receive a deputation on the subject either from the Police Surgeons

the police The English system of death certification and registration being very imperfect and there being no system in London corresponding to that of the mdecinsvrificateurs of Paris these cases

HOSPITALS COMMISSION Overworked Orderlies Among the witnesses whose evidence was taken by the Com missioners on September 5th was the Rev Mr Franklin a local pastor who complained that in the early days the staffs were inadequate There were too few orderlies and the men were overworked Dr James Surgeon of No 9 Hospital said men arriving in convoys were put in bell tents and retained their unwashed clothes which were not changed sometimes for a week He was sorry for the men but did not aoply for changes of cloth ing because he knew it would be useless Major Wright RAMC in charge of St Michaels Home Hospital said wounded and enteric patients were kept apart He denied Mr BurdettCouttss allegation that they were lying side by side Colonel Benson Chief Staff Officer at Bloemfontein said as regards orderlies there had been several cases of men having drink but few cases of intoxication while on duty There were very few complaints in regard to their conduct other wise SurgeonGeneral Wilsons Evidence On September 6th SurgeonGeneral Wilson Principal I Medical Officer in South Africa detailed the arrangements made for the care of the sick and wounded When the Army was increased beyond two Army Corps the Medical Depart ment was undermanned He had inspected the base hospital in Capetown and considered that there was no serious cause of complaint Lord Methuens force had a full equipment for three field hospitals and bearer companies with accommo dation for 600 patients at Orange River In Lord Robertas I advance from Modder River the hospital matriel was con siderably curtailed owing to military exigencies Hospital trains ran to Modder River with stores medicines and appli ances and the sick and wounded were well looked after not withstanding the rapidity of the advance Generally the medical equipment was sent up as expeditiously as possible He contradicted the figures given by Mr BurdettCoutts and Mr Murray Guthrie to show that the deathrate in private hos pitals was less than in military ones Exactly the reverse was the case He also denied having made any statement as to the unsatisfactory condition of the Bloemfontein Hospital General KellyKennys Evidence General KellyKenny explained that on the advance to Bloemfontein the ambulances were cut down considerably owing to military exigencies There were only two ambu lances per brigade instead of ten and the suffering endured was owing to the necessities of the march He paid a tribute to the conduct of the orderlies who behaved splendidly and on occasion did a great deal of work in addition to their own They even carried a number of Boer wounded across a river up to their armpits in water Such service the General stated v was purely voluntary Statements of Civil Surgeons SergeantMajor Roberts and Corporal Beach indignantly denied the truth of the civil surgeons statements with regard to No 8 Hospital  but an orderly from that hospital partly confirmed them Overcrowding at Kroonstadt At Kroonstadt on the same day witnesses admitted the suffering of patients and that there had been overcrowding under field hospital management but they could not see how it could have been altered They agreed that the state of things improved when the General Hospital and the Scottish Hospital arrived The Canadian Red Cross Commissioner and Mr burdettcoutts A telegram in the Times dated Toronto September 5th quotes Dr Ryerson lately Canadian Red Cross Commissioner in South Africa in a letter in that nights Telegram regarding the alleged hospital mismanagement in South Africa as saying  Mr BurdettCoutts has not added much strength to his case by the statement that he cabled his complaint from Capetown to Lord Wolseley Why did he run away from Bloemfontein and Lord Roberts  Why did he not make his complaint where it would have met with instant investi gation  Does it not look as though he feared the results of an immediate investigation  Dr Ryerson further asks how Mr BurdettCoutt reconciles his facts with the mortality statistics as given by Mr Wynd ham and quotes figures showing that the deathrate from enteric fever at Bloemfontein was only 21 per cent against a much higher mortality in the Chitral and more recent cam paigns He asks how it is possible that such good results could be obtained had matters been so bad as they were repre sented to be by Mr BurdettCoutts The Canadian Commis sioner also supports his arguments by pointing to the small disproportion between deaths from disease and those from wounds as compared with the figures in former wars and concludes by saying  Surely there must be something wrong with Mr BurdettCouttss facts The Commissioners at Pretoria The Hospitals Commission reached Pretoria on September 8th and at once got to work SurgeonMajor Kilkelly Grenadier Guards stated that no complaint had been made of the Imperial Yeomanry and Portland Hospitals although there was considerable pressure during the epidemic He 72 MmiLj CONTRACT MEDICAL PRACTICE Sept 15 190a denied that patients unfit to be moved had been taken to the Portland Hospital The latter arrived in Bloemfontein in a storm but tents were not pitched and no patients were received Evidence of Sir William Thomson 8ir William Thomson who has been in civil charge of the Irish Hospital since its commencement complained that the authorities of the hospital were unaware of sick being detained at the railway station on May 23rd as mentioned by Mr BurdettCoutts He had then left Bloemfontein He remem bered similar incidents in April in which notification had been given of the arrival of a train but the train was several hours late owing to a breakdown and the men were left without food The arrangements for feeding patients at railway stations were not efficient until latterly When Lord Roberts advanced the sick had unfortunately to be taken on with the army from Roodeval as it was considered unsafe to send them back He confirmed Mr Murray Guthries statement that he had said that the men could not be properly treated in bell tents and that there were insufficient stores in Pretoria He formed a Com mittee in Pretoria which supplied all the hospitals with necessaries purchased in Pretoria and Johannesburg He recommended the reorganisation of the medical department with a view to greater relief being given to the sick and wounded in war time establishing the definite principle of a civil nursing system This civil nursing system should be a distinct department associated with the army under special officers Consulting physicians were more necessary than surgeons in a campaign where only onesixteenth of the men in hospital were wounded and the remainder were sick Evidence of Chaplains and Others The Rev Maurice Jones garrison chaplain spoke highly of the hospital arrangements with the exception of the 12th Brigade Field Hospital where the medical officer in charge of 290 patients was left practically without a staff for twelve days Captain Mould denied that men for the Irish Hospital remained unattended at Bloemfontein Station for a long time The Rev W Le Grave Roman Catholic Chaplain to the Forces considered that the Woodstock Hospital was badly situated and difficult to keep clean but the patients had every attention Everything was perfect in Pretoria Evidence of Mr Kendal Franks Mr Kendal Franks consulting surgeon described the con dition of the field hospital after Paardeberg as most distressing but said it was unavoidable owing to the accommodation being cut down to meet the necessities of the campaign He denied that 2000 sick arrived in Bloemfontein after the action at Paardeberg The total number of patients in Bloem fontein on March 16th was 302 Accommodation was always found for the sick and wounded but there was a great deal of overcrowding The dead were always buried in separate graves Major Faunce denied Mr Murray Guthries allegation that the hospitals in Pretoria were short of everything Illness of the Chairman According to a Reuter telegram dated September 9th Lord Justice Romer was unwell on that day and it was considered possible that the resumption of the proceedings will be post poned Splendid Work by Doctors Nurses and Orderlies Up to the present the complaints says Reuter made are chiefly in regard to matters of detail but nearly the whole of the evidence bears testimony to the splendid work of the doctors nurses and orderlies CONTRACT MEDICAL PRACTICE THE GROWTH OF CONTRACT PRACTICE Commercial Travellers Association At a time when the medical profession is struggling to emancipate itself from the bondage to which it has been reduced by powerful workingclass medical associations we feel it our duty to draw attention to the movement which is being very quietly carried on to enrol commercial travellers clerks and their families in a widespread medical benefit society We have received a copy of the following circular but at present we think it desirable to suppress names and addresses  and Commercial Travellers Association   Division President Esq JP February 1900 C T A Medical Branch Dear SirIn order to meet the wishes of members who desire to co operate for the provision of firstclass medical attendance for themselves and families on the lines of the medical schemes adopted by and other G T As it is proposed to organise a similar scheme in connec tion with theDivision and arrangements have been pro visionally concluded with an eminent local physician holding high London University qualifications on the following terms  ios 6d per annum for consultations to a member or any of his family at the doctors house For visits at members residence a reduced fee of ss per visit Medicines will be supplied if desired by the physician at a reduced charge This exceptionally favourable arrangement is necessarily subject to a minimum membership and it is hoped that those desirous of joining our Medical Branch will kindly fill up and return the enclosed form to the undersigned at the earliest possible date Yours faithfully Honorary Secretary To this is appended a form of application and an undertaking to pay the annual subscription in advance We have reason to know that this scheme will be brought before the medical profession in the localities where it is being worked The circular does not say how much the eminent physician re ceives per annum of the halfguinea subscribed The adequacy of the rate of payment must no doubt depend upon the class of persons who take advantage of the scheme the general rate of payment in the district and the status of the practitioner employed but it certainly appears to us to be very moderate As while there are many commercial travellers and clerks who are poor there are also very many who are quite welltodo there is the gravest risk that the scheme will be abused and that by accepting such work the profession will be forging another link in the chain which threatens to reduce the great mass of practitioners to a state of illpaid servitude Medical Clubs in Lancaster The medical men in Lancaster are at present engaged in an interesting little contest with the members of various

in Lancaster is certainly not un reasonable having regard to the nature of the skilled ser vices which they would undertake to render for it The former rate of 3s 6d is absurdly low and the increase to 4s is inadequate The Backworth Collieries and their Doctobs 1 The Newcastle Daily Journal recently reported a meeting called by an association styling itself  The Backworth and District Medical Cooper ative Association The object of the meeting appeared to be to form a medical club for Backworth and district to provide cheap medical attend ance for its members without regard to their social position It was stated that already 550 persons had agreed to become members and it was decided to advertise for a doctor at once Thi3 movement appears to have arisen in consequence of the Backworth colliery doctors demanding a more equitable scale of remuneration for their services As the colliery doctors are united it has been found necessary to call in outsiders to crush their union and for that purpose the above Association has been called into existence The modest demand of the doctors is that gd per miner and family shall be paid each fortnight instead of 6d as heretofore It is to be regretted that any of our profession should find it necessary to accept such con tracts even at the enhanced rate and we earnestly hope that no prac titioner will be found to assist the Backworth and District Cooperative Medical Association against his brethren and the interests his pro fession A Mobile Hospital In NatalSource The British Medical Journal Vol

with which he worked They give a very good idea of the difficulties of transport and of the rough and ready condi tions under which the surgical work had to be done                    ig  iA enou

mobile However it was not technically a field hospital although at the battle of Colenso and during the fighting about Spion KoD its officers manaced to get it un not verv far from the fighting line Major Kirkpatrick ItAMC was the officer in charge and the other officers were at first Major Mallins and Lieutenant Sim son On December ith igoo it was established at Frere a station on the line from Maritzburg to Ladyamith a few miles south of Chieveley and Mr Trevees with his two nurses Miss MeCaul and Miss Tarr went up with the hospital A day or two afterwards the nursing staff received a valuable reinforcement in the person of two sisters of the Army Nursing Service The general appearance of the hospital camp is seen in the first photograph Fig i which shows both the large marquees and the small bell tents in one of whichthat in the foreground Mr Treves was established The army moved off from Frere Camp on December 13th and early on December isth the day of the first unsuccessful attempt to force the passage of the Tugela at Colenso No 4 Stationary Hospital was ordered to move up with all speed to Chieveley where it was established about three and three quarter miles from Naval Hill wbere the British big guns were firing There it remained for that day and until December 17th when a retirement to b rere was rendered necessary by the fact that the camp at Chieveley was within reach of the Boer shells During these two days an enormous amount of work was done by the staff of the hospital which Mr Treves rejoined on the evening of the day of battle December 15th after a heavy afternoons work with the field hospitals established im mediately behind Naval Hill and under its shelter The tent in which all the operations were done is seen in another photograph Fig 3 which shows the improvised operating table of biscuit boxes When it is remembered that the temperature in the shade on December 15th and 16th was I0 F and on December i8th io49 F and that at Chieve ley water was scarce it will be understood that these were very trying days both for the wounded and their surgeons and nurses Mr Treves pays awarm tribute to the patient courage of the wounded to the excellentwork done by the RAMC officers and to the devotion and cheerful endurance of the four nursing sisters and it does not require much reading between the lines of his graphic letters to perceive that Mr Treves spared himself not at all but worked as hard and cheerfully as anybody at Frere the hospital remained gradu ally passing on its wounded to the base hospitals at Pietermaritzburg or to the hospital ships in Durban harbour but filling their places with cases of dysentery and typhoid fever until January 13th Jgoo when the order to move to Springfield on the Lesser Tugela i8 miles away to the west was received Colonel Gallwey CB RAMC the Principal Medical Officer with General Buller had determined

are of a clumsy pattern made strong to go anywhere much suffering was prevented and in Mr Trevess opinion many lives and limbs saved At Frere wlhich was reached on February i ith the wounded were again placed in the hospital and as soon as possible moved on by train to Mooi River Base Hospital or to the hospital ships at Durban These trains were improvised by Major BrazierCreagh RAMC who did wonders with the material at his disposal Unfortunately the carriages had no through communication and it was difficult to arrange their conversion However by hard work and the expenditure of much energy and ingenuity Major BrazierCreagh overcame all superable obstacles and made the best of insuperable defects Fig 2 iS from Mr Trevess photograph of one of these trains and shows the

Sir Redvers Buller one must bave seen the district around Colenso Opposite this village the Tugela is a broad and rapid river with steep and rugged banks which changes its course continually For months past it has been unfordable and the only bridges crossing it had been destroyed by the Boers On either side of the river are irregular ranges of hills which are divided by deep ravines into innumerable kopjes of every conceivable shape These vary in height from soo tO 2000 feet above the surrounding plain Many of them are almost perpendicular and most of them are thickly covered by dense mimosa scrub and huge boulders so that an army corps could be hidden amongst them without a man being visible Each kopje bristled with strong and deep trenches so skilfully constructed that as each one was captured it was exposed to a withering fire from all sides To add to our difficulties the plain between Colenso and Ladysmith is studded with kopjes which completely com mand both the road and the railway The seeming impossi bility of the task might well have caused even the bravest troops to hesitate and it was only after four stubborn attacks which extended over a period of 28 days hard fighting that the position was finally carried The strain which this entailed on our troops can only be realised by those who were present Imagine an attack which lasted continuously for x7 days as did the final one on the Boer position During the whole of that time the troops slept on the hillsides amidst thunder storms and rain with not even a great coat to cover them No words can do justice to their courage heroism fortitude and cheerfulness under all the hardships and privations to which they were exposed Ladysmith the goal of all our hopes during so many

misgivings as to the advisability of accepting them unless it be in the homes of officers or others accustqmed to the management of soldiers Numerous small homes are not considered practicable on account of the impossibility of pro viding for proper discipline and military supervision The distribution of the men among such homes as may be ulti mately accepted will be arranged on the territorial system the soldiers being sent to such establishments as are in proximity to their usual military dep6ts It is clear that ample accommodation can be secured by the authorities to supplement their own which is utterly in adequate and that private generosity backed by the numerous public funds will provide the necessary means But so far no very decided action would seem to have been taken to secure the advantage of this humane and practical patriotism and to ensure that the accommodation for con valescent soldiers shall be ready in good time At the moment it is true the demand for such quarters for those invalided from the front is very smalland the War Office does not seem to antici pate the need of even extra hospital beds for two or three months to come But the sick and wounded are already arriving and the period of grace for preparation will be short It is very greatly to be hoped that it will not be allowed to slip away but that the War Office will lose no time in definitely accepting and organising such of the numerous privately offered convalescent homes as are most suitable The sugges tions which have been made of providing accommodation of the kind at Cape Town itself and the offer by Messrs Elder Dempster and Co of beds in their hotel at Las Palmas are well worthy of careful consideration There is not much time left however which can be legitimately devoted to mere con sideration and whatever is going to be done in the matter should be done promptly As regards officers the Duke of Abercorn has initiated a Sick and Wounded Officers Surgical and Medical Aid Fund which includes among its objects the provision of convalescent accommodation and promises to afford much needful help in a quarter where it will be almost as much required as in the case of the rank and file The Committee recognise that the task of dispensing this aid will require much tact and discretion The work of this fund will be supplemented by the generous offers of accom modation not only at home but in the Riviera Madeira and elsewhere ARMY MEDICAL REFORM THE longcontinued and bitter opposition in past years to reform in the status of medical officers left a deep distrust which has delayed that rehabilitation which its friends believed would have speedily followed the granting of genuine army status and title in a Royal Medical Corps Distrust easily engendered is difficult to remove so that even if the concession of due status to medical officers has silenced if not shamed their more aggressive opponents it has as yet notbeen entirely successful in inducing young medical men to select the army as a suitable professional career But we cannot doubt that great and farreaching reform will yet do so provided certain muchneeded reforms consecutive to the creation of the Royal Corps are now promptly taken in hand The coming wave of general army reform which must follow the Boer war will doubtless include the medical service and it is fortunate for it that its old opponents may have little say in its new reorganisation The time for formulating the reforms wanted is distinctly propitious and to this end we welcome the able and temperate article which Major Cockerill has published recently1 He enumerates many obstacles to the attractiveness and popularily of the service which must be removed before it can become a truly efficient or contented body We take no objection to any of his strictures but think his statement of them somewhat diffuse and fr the benefit of those who may have to handl practicdlly the reforms it would be well to group them under a few inclusive heads such as the following X Undermanned establishments 2 questions of pay 3 honours and rewards 4 revision of regulations The increase of establishments is the first and most press ing The medical service must be made at least numerically sufficient for all average duties This it certainly is not at present Further from undermanning flow many of the worst disabilities from which it suffers An establishment of l ooo medical officers has been sug gested as a minimum Whether sufficient or not they would still be much under the total strength of the department of thirty or forty years ago Of course suoh an increase like the increase of cavalry or artillery means money but we greatly misjudge the present temptr of the country if it permits clamant Army reforms to be sacrificed to a false economy or to mere bud get balancing As Major Cockerill demonstrates it may be easier to vote an increased establishment than to fill it unless the War Office faces squarely and fairly the question of medical supply and demand It is believed by many that the available supply of medical men will be lessened in the future by the extension of an expensive curriculum to five years It is urged further that the prohibition of unqualified assistantships has so increased the salaries of assistants in civil practice that they now equal or surpass in value the pay of a lieutenant Royal Army Medical Corps due allowance being of course made for unavoidable outlay in the service The Army has also to compete with the Indian Medical Service which despite drawbacks offers a more varied career more fixed appointments and higher pensions with scarcely greater tropical service From all these considerations it is clear that considerable amelioration in the terms of Army service will have to be effected especially in the junior ranks before it can successfully compete in the open market Undermanning of the medical service is the fruitful source of drawbacks and hardships and is thus the indirect cause of much of its unpopularity To it may be traced the grievous inequality between home and foreign tours the worry and expense attendant on incessant movements the drudgery irksome and irritating of perpetually recurring orderly duty the difficulty in getting private and the impossibility of ob taining  study leave In short through undermanning the medical service is over strained at home and abroad overworked everywhere and hustled and worried to an intolerable degree It is at present at least 30 short of an arbitrary nominal strength of 890 and that number is about 20 per cent under the strength deemed necessary thirty or forty years ago when our empire and our army were much smaller than now It has thus been allowed to dwindle down while its duties in creased until it is now numerically unequal to the work whether in peace or in war Questions of pay mubt obviously be considered in relation to those of supply and demand in the medical profession at large to which we have already alluded but they can be viewed on their merits in which sense we assett without hesitation that an increase is necessaTy both in the home and Indian rates in the ranks of lieutenants and captains Neither scales of pay are sufficiently above those now given to civil assistants and are indeed insufficient to meet the necessary expenses of the officer The junior ranks spend a large proportion of their total service under the Government of India which benefits much by such a facile arrangement yet it has treated the financial parts of several Royal Warrants affecting medical offilers with a neglect which absolutely amounts to a scandal Army medical officers are still paid in India according to the provisions of warrants which have been cancelled and obsolete for more than twenty years Successive Secretaries of War and for India have been often entreated to put an end to such an injustice but have failed to do so It remains for Parliament to insist that the Indian Executive must and shall respect the financial provisions of Royal Warrants Not only does the Government of Irndia pay the officers of the RAMU less than theirown medicalofficers but also less than those of any Ecientific or kindred branchthe Veterinary for instance While we by no means consider that braneh overpaid yet a veterinary lieutenant receives many more rupees a month than a medical lieutenant

AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION M fTxmmx 209 greater store is apparently set on the horse than on the man who rides him The distribution of honours and rewards to medical officers has long been in most scanty proportions compared with other officers as the present war again demonstrates although medical officers share in all the hardships and many of the risks of their combatant brethren their allotment of the mystic letters CB KGB CMG etc is merely nominal compared with other branches Nor as far as known has the Indian Government which makes so great on economy out of the services of the army medical officers ever recommended one of them even for the lowest class of the Star of India The attitude of the dispensers of honours is clearly exem plified in the omission of the name of the principal medical officer of the last Soudan expedition notwithstanding that he was absolutely the senior officer present from the big list of those to whom the thanks of Parliament were tendered and worse still when the omission was challenged a Minister was put up not to apologise but to defend in the lamest way such a grossly indefensible thing As to tangible rewards they are nonexistent to the vast bulk of the medical service The few good service pensions on the principle of the confided talents are carefully reserved for the senior rank only chiefly we suppose because it is senior Revision of the Regulations is necessary in two directions first all obsolete or unnecessary paragraphs and articles which assert or imply the bad old supposed inferiority of medical officers should be expunged secondly new regulations which shall define the position of medical officers on parade and ceremonial occasions and their position on Courts Boards etc should be inserted Even commissions in the RAMC are still not worded in corps or regimental form but in that of an extinct department The Regulations Branch of the War Office want waking up to such anomalies We have not in this review been able to go into details but we trust we have sufficiently indicated broadly the rejorms which demand speedy attention by those who may desire to take effective action towards the rehabilitation of the Army Medical Service THE ST JOHN AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION STOCKPORT CENTRE AN account of the difficulty which had arisen at Stockport with regard to the administration of the St John Ambulance Association centre there and of the action which the Stock port Medical Society had felt itself compelled to take was published in the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL of April 22nd I899 We then observed that the honorary secretary of the local centre appeared to have mistaken the relation in which the St John Ambulance Association stands to the medical profession and observed that it was intolerable that members of the medical profession should be treated with the dis courtesy shown to them by the representatives of the St John Ambulance Association at Stockport As we were able to announce last October the matter was finally referred to arbitration and a brief report of the proceedings before the arbitrators was published in the BRiIns MEDICAL JOUIRNAL of November 4th 1899 We have now received the following award of the arbitrators St John Ambulance Association St Johns Gate Clerkenwell London EC AWARD OF THE ARBITRATORS SIR JAMEs N DICK KCB Colonel C Bowdlier and InspectorGeneral Belgrave Ninnis MD RN were the arbitrators appointed by the Central Executive Committee to inquire into certain differences of opinion at the Stockport Centre ln the summer and autumn of last year the Committee of the St John Ambulance Association being the Ambulance Department of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England were asked by both the Stockport and District Medical Society and by the Executive of the Local Centre of the St John Ambulance Association at Stockport to entertain and arbitrate upon aquestion which had arisen between these two bodies out of the management by Mr Ferns the Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Local Centre Neither the Order itself nor the Ambulance Department of the Order have any function to arbitrate upon such a question but the two parties having agreed in writing to refer the matter to three gentlemen appointed by the Committee of the St John Ambulance Association as arbitrators and we having been appointed by the Committee in that behalf and our appointment having been assented to by both sides proceeded to Stock port with a view to hearing what was to be adduced by each side and to make such an award determination or decision in the premises as alter hearing the evidence and arguments we should think fit Two prolonged meetings were held at the Stockport Courthouse at Stockport on October aoth and 3xst last At these the following parties were represented and in the following manner The Earl Egerton of Tatton Chancellor of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in England and President of the Stockport Centre by Mr Boydell Houghton Barrister Mr A E Ferns Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Stockport Centre also by Mr Houghton Mr A H Sykes JP Chairman of the Stockport Centre by Mr Williaum Cobbett Solicitor and The Stockport and District Medical Society by Mr C H M Wharton Barrister After a patient hearing of all that was to be said and an expression of opinion on both sides that nothing further remained we have taken into consideration the whole circumstances of the case with a view to arriving at an award determination or decision At the very commeneement of the hearing it appeared that there was no question between the Stockport Medical Society and the Stockport Centre of the St John Ambulance Association and Mr Wharton so stated It became apparent then that the question was going to resolve itself into a personal one between Mr Ferns and the Stockport Medical Society and the only manner in which the Centre was interested in the proceeding was that Mr Ferns was the Honorary Secretary and Treasurer of the Centre and the Medical Society had resolved to abstain from lecturing in connection with the Local Centre and threatened to form an indepencent ambulance association With the last of these two suggestions the arbitrators do not intend to interfere If it was intended as a threat it should not have been made as it can have no influence The former of these suggestions does affect the Order and it was upon that ground that the arbitrators thought it within their province to continue the inquiry They wish however at the outset to express their great regret that having regard to the position occupied by the Medical Society and Mr Ferns some way had not been found to compose this personal question without having to resort to the extraordinary method of referring it to a public hearing As the case proceeded the official aspect of the question between the Executive Committee ol the Stockport Centre and the Medical Society still further disappeared and the personal one only remained If this could have been anticipated we are not sure that the Ambulance Depart went would have undertaken the reference at all but having done so snd the parties having undergone the expense of the proceeding we think it would not be fair to them not to record our decision and deter mination Mr Fernss own account of himself is that the Committee was formed and he was appointed Local Secretary so far back as the year i883 and cer tain instruction were given him by Sir then Mr John Furley In a short time meetings of the Committee were held but difficulties arose in this out of the nonattendance of members and Mr Ferns considered thatthe authority given to him by Sir John Furley justified his future proceedings which were practically to carry on the Centre without the attendance of a Committee We think that Mr Ferns has at all events since z888 been acting under a misapprehension We do not think Mr Ferns understood the change that had taken plae in the constitution of the St John Ambulance Association in the year x888 At that time the Association became a department of the Order subject to the rulea and regulations of the Order and although considerable latitude in carrying on a voluntary institution must always be allowed still there are certain definite duties which Mr Ferns seems entirely to have lost sight of We wish to put on record that we think in this matter Mr Ferns is to be blamed because he himself is an esquire of the Order a member of the body and therefore has a special duty to the Order and to see that as far as in him lies everything is done for its glory and utility and that he will never act contrary to its dignity We think if Mr Ferns had found that he could not maintain the Centre he should have so reported and not have left the Centre to be practicallr himself particularly in the light of subsequent events It seems to us to have been alleged and hardly disputed by Mr Ferns that he discharged the duties of secretary and afterwards treasurer of the Stockport Centre in a somewhat arbitrary manner and that accounts were not rendered by him nor were subscriptions collected by him in the district It seems also admitted that the Stockport Centre was more or less in a state of paralysis Mr Fearns calls it quiescence and we can not help feeling that Mr Ferns was to some extent responsible for this It further appeared that there was a rumouralthough the rumour was a floating one and could not definitely be tracedthat some illdefined charge had been made against Mr Feans of having acted improperly with regard to the funds of the Centre The existence of such a rumour was particularly with regard to a charge of La 5s for classes admitted by both sides If the Committee had met such a rumour would have been impossible We wish here to state that the charge of 5 58 to the classes referred to in the course of the inquiry was a proper charge It seems clear to us that Mr Ferns was under the impression erroneous as we believe it to be that this rumour originated from some medical gentlemen of position in the town We are satisfied that Mr Ferns has in all his dealings with regard to the funds of the Centre acted with the utmost integrity and this cannot be questioned We also feel assured tbat the impression in Mr Fernss mind as to the origin of the rumours we have mentioned was unfounded It appeared to us that Mr Ferns did in his dealings with various medical men in the town in connection with his secretaryship comport himself in a manner which cannot be said to have been courteous or conciliatory or to have been for the dignity or utility of the Order and for this we consider that Mr Ferns Is to blame Jn what ever way Mr Ferns might bave considered himself in his private capacity justified in treating the medical men in respect of whose conduct he had this suspicion Mr Ferns should have remembered that he was a mem ber of the Order and holding an important and responsible official posit ion In connection with the ambulance department of the Order and what he Description Of Ambulance For The Mounted ServiceAuthors T F S CaverhillSource The British

By T F S CAVERHILL MB CM FRCPEDIN SurgeonMajor the Lothians and Berwickshire Yeomanry Cavalry UHE military history of this and other countries shows that when any new evolution of tactics or war mateiial takes place we have had the utility of the cavalry arm called in question but it has always been found that thlat force enters upon new and more responsible duties The institution of the cavalry manceuvres in I890 marked the beginning of the cavalry renaissance but since the introduction of the magazine rifle and even since the beginning of the Boer war in October the supreme importance of the mounted services in modern warfare has been finally established We see a whole British army largely owing to its insufficient mobility checkmated at various points and the situation cannot be altered until a large mounted force is sent to its relief It has now been decided to organise a total force of 20000 regular and irregular cavalry yeomanry and mounted infantry With such an enormous addition of mounted men we are naturally led to inquire how the existing medical arrangements will suit such an altered state of things We are met at once by the fact that the great alterations in the medical regulations which have been made in the past few years in the interests of the infantry have not been adapted to the requirements of cavalry or horse artillery The ambulance arrangements for cavalry in war are practically nonexistent Surgeon General Evatt We have the same medical organisation and that a dis mounted one for both the infantry and cavalry divisions and if this system has been condemned by cavalry commanders in the past how much more will it now prove itself unsuited to such a large rapidly advancingwidely extending and rapidly retiring force of mounted men called on constantly to fight mostly on foot at great distances from the main body When a British army corps takes the field it has attached to its divisions for the care of its wounded the bearer com panies of the Army Medical Corps These are entirely non regimental and quite distinct from the ambulance detach ment in each regiment called regimental stretcher bearers These bearer companies on foot have to keep up with the cavalry or infantry divisions to which they belong notwith standing the widely different conditions under which they act The existing medical arrangements of a dismounted bearer company with a cavalry division in the field have been condemned by experienced cavalry commanders and army surgeons notably by the late MajorGeneral Sir Herbert Stewart who from his experience in Egypt described the system as  absolutely unsuitable In a memorandum which he presented to Lord Morleys Committee in x883 the Army Hospital Services Inquiry Committee he suggested the establishment of a mounted bearer company to accompany cavalry similar to one he improvised in Egypt and which had done excellent service Lord Morleys Committee unani mously recommended that in the medical organisation of cavalry brigades in the field provision be made for mounted bearer companies No attempt has yet been made to carry out this recommendation neither in the medical regulations nor in the new Manual of the ATmy Medical Corps do we find any reference to the subject The names of many distinguished officers could be men tioned who have had experience in numerous inatances where the wounded were unattended to for hours and where the movements of troops were hindered Among them Sir Drury Lowe who writes I have often heard Sir Herbert Stewart say how terribly he was ham pered by not having his wounded readily transported General Lord Ralph Kerr late Commandant at the Cur ragh states that Cavalry must be sadly crippled when they have only the present organisation to look after their wounded SurgeonGeneral Evatt described how in Egypt he was sent back to the infantry square when toiling with his bearer company on foot miles behind the cavalry force to which he was attached the wonder was they were not cut to pieces by the enemy The late SurgeonGeneral Wolseley was of opinion that no greater boon could be conferred on the cavalry than the suggestion of some efficient way of carrying their sick and wounded While on humane grounds alone some new organisation should be established it has been remarked especially in savage countries how the daring of the soldier is increased by knowing that help is at hand When a soldier is wounded he is in excruciating pain if a nerve is injured and faint from the shock and loss of blood he is in dreadful uncer tainty and apprehension as to whether his hurt is mortal or slight He is tired cold hungry and thirsty and after lying many hours unattended he is haunted with the idea that he has been forgotten or will not be found and that he will die before relief comes Still more serious are the surgical objections The anti septic system of dressing wounds has revolutionised civil and military surgery The epidemics of erysipelas blood poison ing and hospital gangrene which killed hundreds in every campaign are no longer seen where it can be carried out But as Esm arch says It is a necessity that the patient should have a dreEsing applied and that he is brought to the dressing station to be further treated as soon as possible In the Bosnia and Herzegovina war of occupation by Austria in I878 the writer taw hospitals crowded to excess there was not a single epidemic of erysipelas or other hospital disease as in every case a  first dressing had been imme diately applied and indeed sometimes remained on un touched until complete healing resulted If it is a necessity for the best results of the antiseptic system in war not only for the wounded soldier himself but also for the other wounded amongst whom he is placed to have an immediate dressing applied it is equally necessary in order to diminish the mortality to have oper ations carried out especially in joint injuries and amputa tions at the earliest possible moment PirogofP narrates how Reyher in the Bulgarian war found the mortality rise from io to 6i per cent by the delay of a few hours in joint injuries and from i8 per cent to 35 per cent with gunshot fractures That in fact the brilliant results of antiseptic surgery cannot be obtained unless it is applied within two or three hours as it will be found the highest rates of mortality correspond with those seen when ordinary dressings are used Von Bergmann in the RussoTurkish war showed how important an early application of an antiseptic tampon is in the further pro gress of the wound Mac Cormac insists on the importance of treating all joint and gunshot fractures qt once antiseptically at the dressing station Fischer the greatest German writer on military surgery lays down that antiseptics must be applied early and that a greater force of doctors and dressers must be at the dressing station to carry the treatment out fully The greatest danger to the wounded soldier then lies betweenthe fighting line and the field hospital and it is there that medical aid should be least defective Chenu2 states in his report of the Crimean war that we had after every fight 5 or 6 per cent dying from hwmor rhage many from trivialwounds Ledran puts the percentage a little higher It is evident that many lives would be saved if a sufficiently large staff was stationed immediately behind the fighting line Fitzgerald states that in the FrancoGerman year he specially noted the terribly increasing 68 MIK BJ0UEXNLJ AMBULANCE FOR MOUNTED SERVIOE JAN 13 1900 mortality when the amputations had been delayed more than two or three hours after the receipt of the injury all died if there was a delay of over eight hours It follows from these considerations tactical humani tarian and surgical that the bearer company should be mounted and able to follow a mounted force everywhere It should have conveyances for transporting men sitting or lying down every fourth wounded soldier requires to be kept flat either in a regular or improvised manner and it should have sufficient surgical appliances as a surgeon without his appliances and dressings is like a battery without ammuni tion To provide an efficient medical service for the mounted forces the following points are suggested I The addition of a second surgeon to all cavalry regiments in the field For surgical and physical reasons this is neces sary 2 That the regimental ambulance detachment of a cavalry regiment be specially trained and equipped for its duties in improvising rough dressings and means of transport mount ing and dismounting wounded etc 3 That a certain proportion of cacolets and litters should be carried in the regimental transport for transporting the sick and wounded sitting and lying down That these be improved made lighter and more comfortable and that they be carried on properlytrained horses 4 Tnat the detachment be annually inspected by the InspectorGeneral of Cavalry 5 That a mounted bearer company be formed to act with mounted infantry companies or cavalry divisions 6 That where wheeled transport is unsuitable or insufficient for the wounded of an infantry division the mounted infantry horses specially trained be used to carry cacolets and litters after a great battle De Pr6val 3 stated that 750 men with these can do the work of 15000 stretcher bearers 7 That experienced surgeons and assistants with suitable transport and sufficient dressings be always close in rear of the fighting line in greater numbers to carry out at once the demands of the antiseptic system Proposals for the mounted services artillery cavalry and mounted infantry may be considered under two heads I Regimental medical aidthat is that given by the regimental stretcher bearers II Nonregimental medical aidthat is that given by a mounted bearer company attached to a cavalry division PROPOSUD MEDICAL AID FOR A CAVALRY REGIMENT Personnel 2 surgeons i hospital

Captain M Louis Hughes in the list of officers killed in the action at the Tugela River on December i5th produced a profound feeling of sorrow among those who knew either the man or his work He was acting as Assistant Sanitary Officer to the troops at Aldershot when he was chosen by Sir Redvers Buller who had learnt to know his merits at Aldershot to serve on his personal staff and to act as sanitary adviser Captain Louis Hughes received his medical education at Kings College London where he was Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy He obtained the diploma of LRCPLond MRCSEng and LSALond in i889 and entered the Army Medical School at Netley by the competitive examination of August 1889 He passed out of Netley in February 189o taking first place and being awarded the Parkes Memorial Bronze Medal He received his commission as SurgeonCap tain at that date Captain Hughes wasknown to military men as an enthu siast in his profession and as one having the care and wellbeing of the soldier thoroughly at heart Not only has he brought credit by his scientific researches    to the great department to which he belonged but in matters of practical detail whether of sanitary or physi vI cal moment he showed the spirit of true genius For the soldiers benefit he sys tematised and placed on a scientific basis so empiric a subject as chiropody a sub ject of the first importance to the fighting capacity of thesoldfer Forthesoldierls benefit he taught the mean ing of sanitation to soldiers and thereby spread theteach ing of his great predecessor Parkes amongst all classes of the army As Assistant Sani tary Officer at Aldershot he successfully carried through      several hygienic improve ments and reforms which were urgently needed The history of science will always    have a place for his name His able original and scien tific work on Undulant Fever fully entitles him to a high place The unclassified illunderstood and practi cally unnamed fever which found its most virulent ex pression at Malta and was hence named Malta or Mediter ranean fever had long puzzled medical men in both the navy and army Captain Hughess first station abroad was happily Malta He landed there in i890o and immediately took up the study of the prevalent fever The time and energy with which he worked on scientific methods for siix years at this subject served to introduce true scientific precision into our conceptions of Malta fever The result of his researches was published in a volume entitled Mediter ranean Malta or Undulant Fever Macmillan I897 On returning to England he was selected as one of the secretaries to the first meeting of the Section of Tropical Diseases at the Edinburgh meeting of the British Medical Association in 1898 and it was largely owing to blis exccllent organisation and keen enthusiasm that the experiment of holding this qec tion was so successful as to warrant its becoming a regular part of the programme at the annual meetings At Aldershot although in official charge of the bacteri ological as well as the chemicallaboratory Captain Hughess concern in this department was no mere official supervision From time tco time carefullyconducted investigations were carried out by him there and we only hope that his un publishedwork may not be altogether lost by his untimely death We have in our ranks but few men whether in military or civil life who have done so much work of real scientific value as Hughes accomplished in the short time allotted to him It is only ten years since Captain Hughes received his diploma and his name is known and honoured by all grades of his profession The news of the battle of Colenso just received tells how Sir Redvers Buller fearlessly exposed himself to the rifle and shell fire of the      enemy how the members of his staff of which Captain Hughes was one were hit and their hones killed and    it was in this storm of missiles that Captain Hughes was killed We mourn his loss as a scientific worker we sympathise sincerely with his wife and child and the  British soldier has cause to remember with affection one who worked so well in their behalf during times of peace and in time of war laid down 3 St i i gi his life in the service of hi country Dr Patrick Manson who is so well qualified to appraise the value of Hughess work and whp was President of the Section of Tropical Diseases   when Hughes was secretary has sent in the following tribute to his memory Captain Hughes called on me a day or two before he left for the seat of war The object of his visit so he I1 explained was to thank me for a trifling favour to ask for suggestions on such special lines Ifor pathological investi gation as the opportunity of his service in Natal might  W afford and to say goodbye The visit and its object were characteristic of the man his punctilious acknowledg ment of even a small favour his keen interest in the science of his profession and his courtesy I saw a good deal of Captain Hughes in connection with his Secretaryship of the Tropical Seo tion at the Edinburgh meeting of the Association as well as on other occasions and I learned to regard him as an ideal army surgeonsoldierly in his bearing gentle as the physician ever should be and a devoted and successful but very modest student of his profes sion His untimely death is a loss not only to the RoyalI Army Medical Corps but also to the profession at large and to medical science VRis work on Mediterranean Fever shows2 what he was capable of doing both as an original investi gator and as a writer It is by far the best work on the subject of which it treats In its completeness thoroughness conscientious accuracy and lucidity it is a model Since Bruce discovered the micrococcus melitensia no individual worker has done so much as Hughes towards relegating Mediterranean fever to its proper pathological niche Doubtless had the Boer bullets spared him he would 1758 r7DICAL JOVDAll THE WAR IN SOUTEH AFRICA DEC 23 15999 have given us more and even better work than this for as I understood from him he was eager to get on relying for advancement not on patronage on seniority or on chance but on professional merit hard work and his deserts Sur geons in the services sometimes complain of lack of oppor tunity for original work of the discouraging interruptions arising from the frequent changes of station and other exigencies of their respective services as being inimical and even fatal to successful endeavour and even of official dis couragement Hughes has not lived in vain if his bright example in struggling against and in overcoming such diffi culties be taken to hearl His book is permanent evidence of the vast amount of research literary and scientific that can be got through even by the hardest worked among them if they make the most of their opportunities A military correspondent who had good opportunities of judging Captain Hughess work writes For the last three years he acted as assistant sanitary officer to the troops at Aldershot an office created by the present enlightened head of the Army Medical Service During this period he had charge of the bacteriological and chemical laboratories at that important military centre and extended and improved their organisation immensely He was a capable bacterio logist and held the diploma in Public Health He arranged the medical portion of the combined medical and engineering course of lectures delivered to all quartermasters at Alder shot to initiate them into the rudiments of sanitation con nected with their important duties In this course which was first ordered by HRH the Duke of Connaught when in command at Aldershot and which was cordially supported by Sir Redvers Buller who succeeded him Captain Hughes took a prominent part and became the medical instructor and so effectively did he perform his duty that many of those who attended his classes were able to obtain by examination the certificate of the National Health Society given for knowledge of the rudiments of eanitation Again when chiropody was started in the army at Aldershot Captain Hughes took it up with his usual energy delivered lectures and framed a syllabus of instruction which it is understood the War Office will utilise when the question reaches a more advanced stage as it doubtless would have done before this had it not been for the war in South Africa Captain Hughess death is regarded as a serious loss by the medical service where his scientific acquirements were to the advantage of the army generally and tended to enhance the position of the army medical service in public estimation When Captain Hughes was killed he was serving on the staff of Sir Redvers Buller as his personal medical attendant for which office he was selected by that officer who had a good knowledge of his merits from his experience of him at Alder shot Captain Hughes leaves a wife and child to mourn his death From Our Special Correspondent In Capetown November 30th 1899 THE WOUNDED AT CAPE TOWN ARRIVAL OF THE WOUNDED FROM BELMONT MILITARY medical matters here are beginning to assume a busy aspect The wounded from Belmont arrived on November 26th in the ambulance trains which I have described pre viously and which have proved admirably fitted for their pur pose Several of the wounded men told me that they were most comfortable on the way down A few Boer wounded were included in the consignment All were conveyed to No i General Hospital Wynberg with comniendable despatch In order to supplement the ambulance waggons and to prevent the delay in conveyance from Wynberg Station to the hospital several large vans belonging to furniture firms here were brought into requisition and answered the purpose exceedingly well WOUNDS OF THEI ABDOMEN AND GROIN Many of the injuries are of a severe character there being as before a large proportion of wounds of the extremities and of these again many were somewhere in the neighbourhood of the hip joints Why this should be it is difficult to say One hypothesis is that the enemy aims at the sporrans of the Highlanders but as the proportion is just as evident with the other corps this will hardly hold water Curiously enough however a man belonging to the Transvaal Ambulance told me quite spontaneously that some of the commandants had directed the Boers to aim by preference at the abdomens of our men on the ground that Mauser bullet wounds would be more effective in that region than anywhere else I paid little attention to the remark at the time but it has since struck me that this may in a measure account allowing for indifferent marksmanship for the large number of wounds of the hip groin and thigh One curious case of a penetrating abdominal wound unfortunately ending in death was described to me by Major Simpson RAMC The man had been hit at Belmont when he arrived here he ha4d manifest peritonitis and death resulted soon after arrival There was a Mauser wound apparently an entrance aperture 3 inches below and 2 to the left of the umbilicus Just over the crest of the left ilium was an apparent exit wound naturally ascribed to the same bullet Near this latter wound a movable body could be felt which was thought to be a detached fragment of the iliuxn Post mortem two bullets were found one just above the crest of the ilium this was the supposed fragment of bone This bullet had evi dently entered at the wound near the umbilicus and with out damaging the small intestine had perforated the descend ing colon just above the sigmoid flexure and impinged against the ilium The wound near the ilium was the en trance wound of another bullet which was found loose in the lesser sac just below the great curvature PENETRATING WOUNDS OF THE CHEST The few penetrating wounds of the chest are all doing re markably well In some cases there have been absolutely no symptoms in others nothing more than a little early hremo ptysis and in a few some pleural effusion One chest wound was rather curious The bullet had entered close to the right nipple had traversed the chest laterally apparently just grazing the posterior aspect of the sternum then emerging at almost identically the same spot on the opposite side it finally entered the left ulna an inch or so below the elbow smashing that bone severely The chest wound has healed without the least trouble The arm wound has unfor tunately become septic and was looking rather bad A man wounded at Belmont the bullet having entered just below the spine of the left scapula and emerged in the right mid axillary line at the level of the seventh rib had yesterday a little effusion in both pleurse but no other untoward sign and only a very slight rise of temperature I Eaw one Martini wound and two undoubtedly inflicted by some kind of soft nosed bullet both amongst our men WOUNDS OF THE HEAD I saw one bullet wound in which the frontal bone was slightly  ploughed for about 2 inches without any apparent fracture but with some diplopia resulting In another case the projectile had glanced along the cranium but without causing any fracture of the outer table but as the patient was hemiplegic he was trephined over the seat of injury and extensive fracture of the inner table discovered He is now doing well WOUNDED PRISONERS The Boer prisoners are not as a rule severely hurt The two worst cases are those of FieldCornet Pretnrius and a man named Impey The former has sustained a LeeMetford wound of the kneejoint with a fracture of the patella which has got more or less septic but does not appear likely to lead to anything worse than a stiff knee The latter was hit rather curiously A bullet entered just below the outer can thus on one side and emerged in the temporal region on the other He is quite blind on the side of emergence The Boer wounded are kept in separate wards but are of course in every way on the same footing as the others and one of them whom I knew slightly some years ago was loud in his praise of the attention he and his comrades are re ceiving THE WYNBERG HOSPITAL The General Hospital is proving quite equal to the toler ably heavy demands made upon it and not even the most critical civilian could find anything to find fault with In ap pointments no civil hospital could possibly surpass it The DEc 23 18991 MEDIOAL ASPECT3 OF THE BOER WAR TM 1759 operating theatTe is perfect in its way and the whole place reflects very great credit on Colonel Supple and Major Simp son who superintended its oonversion from an ordinary hut camp to its present purpose LieutenantColonel Hodson is in charge of the surgical and Major Barnes of the medical division Major Simpson is doing duty under the former Colonel Stevenson the officer in charge of the lines of communication is evidently not dis posed to rest altogether on his Netley laurels but is taking an active interest in the executive work of the hospital He for one may be commended to the notice of the next post prandial speaker who feels inclined to reproach the RAMC seniors with falling into an administrative groove One of the civil surgeons Mr Freemantle has been detailed as pathologist to the hospital a very commendable step The wounded from Graspan arrived here thisafternoon FIELD AND STATION HOSPITALS IN CAPE COLONY Full details of the field and station hospitals have not yet been completed or at least are not for publication but one station hospitalNo 3has been established at De Aar and several field hospitals are at Orange River or thereabouts There are about nine hospitals for the reception of the various troops guarding the lines of communication between here and De Aar but these are not used for any but the local detach ments of whom there are a goodly number owing to the sus pieion entertained about possible attempts on the line by colonial sympathisers with the enemy Two of these small hospitalsthose at Victoria West and Richmond Roadare under departmental civil surgeons detached from the General Hospital staff the rest under local civil practitioners Lord Methuen has with him a field hospital for each brigade and one for his divisional troops A general hospital is to be established at Rondebosch a suburb of Capetown between here and Wynberg The posi tion chosen by Colonel Supple who is making arrangements for it rapidly is on a gentle slope in an admirable situation Another general hospital still on the water may I am told possibly be fixed at Queenstown The station hospital at Capetown itself has been extended to take 300 patients It is fairly occupied now principally with cases of pneumonia and the like contracted by men on the transports When the troops have ceased to arrive it may be used as an additional general hospital ABUISE OF THE GENEVA FLAG There can unfortunately be but little doubt that the Boers have been abusing the Geneva flag I am told on the authority of an eyewitness that at Belmont they actually fired from cover of an ambulance waggon and at the same battle several Boers professing to be St John men and wearing the badge on their arms were found fully armeda very suspicious circumstance One can only hope that these breaches of usage are the result of defective discipline and not of deliberate malice OFFERS OF LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS AND HOSPITALS Several local associations for the supply of comforts to the wounded have been established at different centres They are all gradually being got into touch with Colonel Young A good many offers of hospital accommodation have been made from various parts These offers are admirably well meant but there is not the least necessity for the military authorities to accept them Splitting the sick up into small batches would lead to a great amount of administrative trouble and the general hospitals can be indefinitely ex panded by tent accommodation In the suburbs of Capetown such as Rondebosch and Wynbergwounded or sick would at this time of the year probably be far better under canvas than in permanent buildings There will be no rain to speak of in this part for months the heat especially in the southern suburbs will never be excessive and the high winds prevalent in Capetown itself scarcely reach these places THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS Now that the medical arrangements are being so fairly tested that one can judge of their efficiency I am struck with the admirable way in which everything is being managed From the collecting station to the base not a hitch appears to have occurred anywhere As it is the fashion in some quarters to decry the army medical arrange ments I think it right to put this on record The brunt of the whole business has thus far fallen upon Colonel Supple who as principal medical officer of the command before the arrival of the army corps staff and as principal medical officer of the base since has been responsible for most of the arrangements He has certainly shown indefatigable activity and unerring judgment in all he has doneat least so far as I can judge as an impartial out siderand the work at a place like this which is at present the only medical base both for arrivals and wounded from the front complicated as it is by the fact of the general hospital being some miles away from the city is no light task THE FUTURE One remark in conclusion and that I make from an intimate knowledge of the field of operations and of the people con cerned I believe there will be an enormous pressure on the resources of the department during the next few weeks This will not be so much in the shape of medical cases for the up lands are very healthy at this time of the year and the camp sanitary arrangements are reported to me to be very good But there will be a very large number of wounded The Boers will contest every inch of the advance to the bitter end Wherever a natural fortification exists they will hold it and although we shall in all cases doubtless drive them out the loss we shall suffer will be great So far as I can gather the leaders have tolerably made up their minds to eventual defeat but they are bent on its coming about at a cost which to quote President Kruger will  stagger humanity It is as well to recognise this beforehand and see that the medical per8onnel is sufficient for the future heavy demand THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER V OUR REVERSES WEEK by week the war appears to assume larger dimensions and more serious aspects Fortunately however the reverses experienced have only had the effect which such experiences have invariably had upon the English They make them re double their efforts and become more determined than ever to win in the end After all what is the position today in South Africa compared with the position in India during the Mutiny  The men who suppressed that are not likely to be dismayed and now we have one of the heroes of that very time Lord Roberts going out in supreme command to South Africa with Lord Kitchener as Chief of Staff General Gatacre One of the reverses sustained during the past unfortunate week was that of General Gatacre in Stormberg Knowing the country as I do I confess to some astonishment at the en deavour made to march a long distance for the purpose of at tacking the Boers in these fastnesses The country in the Stormberg district is of the most wild and mountainous de scription and inasmuch as there was no garrison to relieve nor any other special condition calling for the hazardous ad vance I confess the movement seems difficult to understand However we are all accused of regarding ourselves as field marshals nowadays and I do not propose to discuss the strategy further but there is one peculiarity of General Gatacres military policy which is distinctly open to comment from a medical point of view General Gatacre we are con tinually told is known by the soldiers as General Back Acher on account of the extremely long and arduous marches which he is in the habit of giving his men as a form of exercise The men we are told continually return from these marches extremely exhausted and we submit that these severe bouts of exercise are not the way to develop  condi tion A moderate and rational amount of exercise with proper intervals of rest produces fitness but exhausting marches frequently have the very opposite effect Some measure of this severity would appear to have been carried into the tactics exercised by General Gatacre in his last The Medical Aspects Of The Boer War IIAuthors A South African CampaignerSource The British Medical Journal Vol 2 No 2030 Nov 25 1899 pp 1485148720262609 1151 NOV 25 1899 THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE WAR r 1485 THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR BY A SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGNER II THE LINE OF ADVANCE THE transports are still arriving Thousands of troops and horses guns and ammunition field hospitals and all the other equipment of a great army corps have already been landed on the shores of South Africa Of the reinforcements a portion have gone to Durban and a larger portion are being retained to make up the invading column from the South which will enter the Free State and subsequently the Transvaal From Capetown to De Aar the railway is still open and should be well defended as it passes entirely through the Cape Colony De Aar is the junction on the main line for Kimberley and is one of the advanced depots for Sir R Bullers column The distance from Capetown is nearly 500 miles further east wards on the main lines some 70 miles is Naauwpoort the junction for the Free State This also is securely held and used as an advanced depot KIMBERLEY Information is now to hand that a forward movement having for its object the relief of the garrison at Kimberley has already commenced This is welcome intelligence andmay be regarded as the first step in that forward advance which lies before us Kimberley is situated in the midst of rolling grass plains on the borders of the Free State these plains extend in all directions to the east as far as Bloemfontein and beyond that again to the Basutoland border to the north into Bechuanaland to Vryburg Mafeking and beyond to the south to the Orange River and to the west to the sandy wastes of Nemaqualand Here and there on the surface of these ele vated plains isolated ironstone kopjes hills and rocky ridges are dotted but these may always be avoided and for the most part this country is admirably suited for the operations of cavalry and for that manipulation of a disciplined army which is so invaluable in warfare  Kimberley itself is peculiarly situated On the one side are the Kimberley and De Beers mines and their works which with the floors on which the blue ground from the mines is deposited occupy several square miles the whole of which is lit up with electric light and overlooked by watch towers At a distance of some two miles from Kimberley and its two mines is situated the suburb of Beaconsfield with the Dutoitspan and Bultfontein mines Between these two townships is situated the sanatorium which is the head quarters of the garrison Over the sanatorium and also over the De Beers rock shaft are two commanding watch towers from which men continually survey the whole surrounding grass country through telescopes The advance of the enemy is thus observed at a distance of many miles and with the addition of search lights at night Kimberley is kept con stantly advised of the movements of the enemy The two principal incentives to the Boers to seize Kim berley are doubtless the capture of Mr Rhodes and the stock of diamonds which they would hope to obtain Mr Rhodes as we are informed feels perfectly secure with his  troop of horse  and the rest of the garrison against the attacks of his enemies and the Boers are probably not aware that the stock of diamonds has been removed to Capetown and that should they desire to possess themselves of the precious gems they will have in addition to capturing Kimberley to undertake the necessary mining operations to do so Nevertheless it is certain that the relief of Kimberley at an early date is emi nently desirable in the interests of the health of the town Although the attacks of the Boers have been absurdly in effectual they have succeeded in cutting off the main water supply and keeping the place closely invested The effect of this is that the inhabitants of Kimberley will probably have been compelled in some measure to resort to wells for drinking water and although supplies are said to be forth coming in abundance it is doubtful whether fresh meat can be as freely obtainable as might be desired The population shut up in Kimberley is a large one over 20000 and includes with the De Beers employees several thousand natives The sanitary system of Kimberley is the pail system and involves the removal nightly by a sanitary service of the night soil this is carted some distance out of the town and there de posited on the veld It is questionable whether the town is so invested as to interfere with this service though if it be so some temporary discomfort and even menace to health might arise from this source Kimberley once relieved and the lines of communications freely opened up it would be an ex tremely valuable base for marching on Bloemfontein the capital of the Free State From Kimberley to Bloemfontein the distance is under ioo miles and the country which is entirely open would afford an admirable route for the advance of a column Kimberley has a hospital with 3oo beds and many other buildings capable of conversion into temporary hospitals Should the column proceed from here there is no doubt it will form a most suitable spot for a military hospital on the line of communications RAILWAY TRANSPORT The most momentous question for the Army Medical Ser vice as well as to all other branches of the Army Corps is at what point if any short of Bloemfontein and later Pretoria the railway will finally have to be abandoned Will the advancing column be able to repair and use the railway as they go along carrying their zolling stock and repairing material with them or will a point be reached beyond which repair in any reasonable period of time will become imprac ticable So long as the rail is directly in touch with the army and communication by rail with the advanced dep6ts of De Aar or Naauwpoort remains open the wounded and sick can be moved without discomfort in a few easy stages to Capetown or Port Elizabeth Once there they can either be accommodated in temporary hospitals on land or in one of the hospital ships But once the rail head is left the dis posal of sick and wounded will become a more difficult matter Travelling in a hospital train if not luxury is far from being positive discomfort but travelling by waggon over the roads of the Free State or Transvaal in the rainy season entails suf fering on wounded men Under these circumstances we must hope that even if the railway lines be broken in some places beyond immediate repair means will be found to convey at least a light train over the break to the intact railway beyond The railway system of the Free State and Transvaal are continuous and their permanent way so far unimpaired Their gauge is the same as that of Cape Colony and Natal All Boer rolling stock will of course be with drawn by the Boers as the army advances but if we are once able to get some of our own trains on to this system of rail ways it will be available for the advance as well as for the retirement of sick or wounded DIsPosITION OF THE WOUNDED BEYOND RAILHEAD Nevertheless all contingencies must be provided for and it is quite possible that the advance of the army may have to be made for hundreds of miles without the assistance of the rail way Putting it at its worst the distance from the southern border of the Free State to Pretoria is nearly 4oo miles Fortunately the country is magnificently open and level so that strategically the difficulties should not be great but the march will be a long and arduous one under the most favour able circumstances If fighting occurs on the march as we must assume that it will there will be three alternatives for the woundedthey will either have to advance with the army to be sent back to the railhead or to some hospital on the line of communications3betweenthearmyandthe railhead In eitherof the latter contingencies it is devoutlytobehopedtherewillbe no such disaster as occurred at Dundee where our wounded were left in the hands of the enemy I do not suggest that the enemy did not take care of them and treat them well we are assured that they do both I will not venture to criticise the tactics which rendered such a step necessary but it cannot be ignored that it is a bitter experience for a wounded soldier to find himself in such a position nor can it be doubted that if such a fate came to be regarded as at all a probable con tingency it could have any but a discouraging effect upon our men The line of communications will be the greatest diffi culty Sir R Buller has to contend with and its special bearing upon the disposal of the wounded will no doubt receive his careful consideration Among other things recently added to the army equipment to be sent out to South Africa are a i486 TM 1taJour THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF TfHE WAR Nov 2S 189 KimraAL JouzN J   number of traction engines and trucks It is highly probable that these would be found most serviceable on the plains of the high veld FOOD SUPPLY With reference to the food supply it is certain that a large quantity of tinned meat and vegetables will have to be taken At the same time there is no reason why fresh meat should not be made available for at least an occasional ration During a campaign in which the writer served in South Africa a troop of cattle was taken with the column wherever it moved Over an open country there is not much difficulty about this and both meat and milk are thus supplied TYPES OF SICKNESS LIKELY TO OCCUR To estimate the probable number of the wounded on an expedition of this sort is of course beyond our power We may reasonably hope looking to the great strength of the army now preparing that they will not be great but with regard to the sick the case is somewhat different It is certain that a large body of men cannot travel over the open veld for weeks together without a certain amount of sickness arising The climate taken all round is a healthy and pleasant one and about as well suited for an openair life as any well could be The country to be crossed is high Bloemfontein is 4000 feet Johannesburg nearly 6ooo feet and Pretoria over 4000 feet above sea level On these high plateaux true malaria scarcely ever occurs The two elements which may give some trouble at midsummerand Christmas is midsummer in South Africaare the sun and the summer rains Transient attacks of fever will occur in some instances true solar fever in others one or other of those fevers which even Dr Patrick Manson still describes as the  unclassed fevers  of the tropics These attacks are usually of quite short dura tion and not severe Sharp attacks of diarrhoea and also of dysentery will arise though much depends on the water supply If water is good and plentiful they will not be numerous If drought occursthough this is unlikely on the high veld in the summerthe water supply would be indif ferent and the health of the army would be in a measure affected Take it all round however for my part I would rather campaign on the high veld of South Africa than in any northern European country including England At these high altitudes pneumonia is the most fatal disease the mortality being higher from this disease in South Africa than in England HOT DAYS AND COLD NIGHTS The paper recently issued by the War Office showing the medical arrangements for the field force on service abroad in South Africa and dealing with medical equipment and supplies transport sanitation equipment for nursing sisters rations and other important matters contains an Appendix V headed  Sanitary Notes Natal aind Transvaal Climate This document in referring to the temperature states that at Maritzburg and Ladysmith the temperature in the summer is intense  In Pretoria the variations are not so great the maximum in January the hottest month reaching go9 F while in the coldest months July and August the temperature falls to a minimum of only 300 to 420 F This information is not quite accurate During the writers comparatively short visits to Pretoria he has known the temperature to be 980 in the house while the temperature in the shade some times exceeds that recorded for Maritzburg namely 1050 Pretoria is notoriously one of the hottest large towns in South Africa and during the coming months it is highly probable that in the vicinity of Pretoria a veryhigh degree of heat may be anticipated The warning given as to the great variations between the day and night temperatures is certainly based on accurate observations and is very valuable All troops who may have to bivouac in the open as many of our men will be called upon to do should be provided with woollen night caps The Tam OShanter is an excellent cap in its way for this purpose It is certain that one of the essential pre cautions necessary for sleeping in the open is the provision of adequate covering for the head at night A long woollen cap such as is used by sailors on yachts formed a part of the kit of the men in a campaign through which I served in South Africa Among the precautions required on account of cimate waterproof sheets and cloaks as protection against the heavy rains are recommended There is nothing more trying to troops on the march than having to bivouac or camp at night upon damp ground This is a contingency which fre quently arises during the heavy summer rains and one of the most piactical and simple precautions which can be adopted against this evil is the provision of a waterproof sheet say 6 feet by 3 which the soldier can place on the ground beneath him A small sheet of this sort can be if necessary carried by mounted infantry and cavalry when away from the main column on distant patrols as it goes readily with the blanket on the saddle HEADGEAR HELMET OR WIDEAWAKE Suitable headdress as a protection against the sun is another precaution recommended and in reference to that I should like to say that while the helmet is a universally approved mode of headdress for tropical climates it nevertheless has undoubted objections as a headdress for the soldier during a campaign It is an impossible thing to liedown in it anditvery soon loses its smart appearance further in really gi eat heat I quedtion whether the helmet gives such protection from the sun as is obtained say from a wideawake hat with a pug garree The advantages of the wideawake which is use by all Colonial troops are many the men can sleep in it at night or during the midday halt can lie down on the ground in it For the rough and tumble of camp life it is an infinitely more comfortable and more suitable headdress than the helmet CLOTHING A fourth precaution recommended in Appendix V is  warm clothing even in summer in the Drakensberg country I would point out that the period spent by troops in the Drakensberg country is not likely to be at all prolonged nor is there any appreciable degree of cold in the summer The Drakensberg consists of the somewhat mountainous country between Ladysmith and the Transvaal frontier For the main column proceeding from the south there will be no mountains to be encountered and although I believe serge to be a better material than khaki there is no reason to suppose that during the summer anything in the shape of really thick clothing will be required by the great majority of our troops ENTERIC FEVER DYSENTERY AND DIARRHCEA Reference to the extreme liability of the occurrence of enteric fever is made This is one of the scourges of South Africa It is common in Johannesburg and along the line of mines and will doubtless be liable to arise in any camp remaining in the same spot for any length of time It could have been wished that the instructions with regard to the sanitary precautions necessary against the occurrence ot enteric fever had been a little more detailed and explicit The one remedy urged appears to be the use of disinfectants for which purpose quicklime is strongly recommended but it must be pointed out that it may not be possible for armies on the march to carry any great quantity of material of this sort and that after all there are very few disinfectants which are more efficacious than mother earth which will always be ready to hand its proper use at the latrines is to my mind more important than artificial disinfectants On proper atten tion being given to this one particular detail more will depend probably than upon anything else The abdominal belt is no doubt an admirable precaution against those sudden chills which are associated with the onset of dysentery and diarrhoea MALARIA HAEMATUTRIA AND PNEUMONIA Malarial fevers the Appendix states occur around Delagoa Bay and the Limpopo River and disappear in the higher plateaux of Northern Natal and Zululand but they are carried up some of the valleys  High grounds should therefore be selected for camps and valleys avoided As has already been pointed out the vast tracts of country which are likely to be the scene of our military operations during this warthat is the plains of the Free State and the Transvaal and their borders to the west and east as well as the whole of the south eastern portion of the Transvaalare practically entirely free from malaria so that I do not anticipate that this disease will occur to any appreciable extent among any of our troops The gentle valley or laagte on these high plains is as healthy Nov 25 1899 THE WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA mm B 1487 a and safe as the crests of the rolling undulations Haematuria  red water  is referred to among parasitic diseases as com mon in the lowlying coast country it is also common I may add in the lowlying portions of the Transvaal but these as already stated are not likely to be occupied to any extent by our soldiers The tributaries of the Croco dile River to the immediate north of Johannesburg are infested with the bilharzia parasite The reference to pneu monia is brief but states that it often occurs in the form of epidemics in the Transvaal during the winter months As already pointed out the mortality from this disease on the highlands of South Africa is high and although it is more prevalent in winter than summer it is liable to occur all the year round DISINFECTION A final note in this Appendix commends certain reports for the perusal of the medical officers joining the field force It also adds that any medical officer considering that in order to carry out effectively the measures indicated above for the prevention of disease in connection with standing camps additional materials such as disinfectants are required he should make an immediate demand for them If as I have already suggested the medical officer will only bear in mind that mother earth is by far the most economical and admirable material for his purpose he will be able to avoid unnecessary demands for other disinfectants which may not be readily obtainable at some odd hundred miles from our bases THE WAR IN SOUTTH AFRICA FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRFSPONDENT IN CAPETOWN November 1st THE CENSORSHIP IT is impossible at the present time to send much news with reference to the military medical arrangements for the cam paign In the first place the dispositions which have eo far been made are merely of a temporary nature and will be alto gether remodelled as soon as General Buller has matured his plans and secondly the censorship is so strict that scarcely any information is obtainable as to what has actually been done When I tell you that the Berkshire Regiment were at Stormberg Junction at least a week before any newspaper in Capetown published the informatioin and that only by very slow degrees has the news leaked out that a force in full of some 2500 men is at another pointDe Aarthe readers of the BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL will understand this And as ven Royal Army Medical Corps information may give a rough indication as to troops either being at a particular place or being likely to be sent there it is except in the simplest details invariably refused For this reticence the ever present Boer spy must be held responsible Such details as are obtainable I will however give EXCELLENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE BY THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS The arrangements for the war as carried on thus far appear to be very complete The Natal force I am assured from several trustworthy and independent sources is admirably provided from the medical side Colonel Supple the Prin cipal Medical Officer took a journey there shortly before war broke out and saw to every detail so completely that there was practically nothing to do when Sir George White and his staff arrived And the arrangements he then made have stood the test of practice for the Royal Army Medical Corps has proved thoroughly equal to its work at the fairly severe engagements that have already occurred Contrary to what has sometimes happened nothing has been wanting and mirabile dictu matdriel and personnel have so far always been at the right place The bearer company work was heavy at Elandslaagte owing to the extent of ground covered and the intervention of darkness immediately after the action but it was extremely well done Men who were there write me that the Indian bearers are preferred to their white comrades having as one phrases it  the hands of a woman and they exhibit an absolute indifference to the risks of being under fire It is not contemplated to have a base hospital in Natal the present arrangement being that base hospital patients will be brought down here by ship and taken to Wynberg a fashionable suburb about nine miles from this city The barracks there have been entirely vacated and converted into a hospital capable of holding from 550 to 6oo patients It is with very good reason cogisidered that the hot climate of Durban in the summer precludes that place from being used as a hospital base At present no base hospital except Wynberg has been arranged for but it is quite possible that others may be established at Port Elizabeth and East London This however depends entirely on the lines of advance which Sir Redvers Buller may adopt Neither place is an ideal situation for a hospital owing to depressing weather in summer whilst the climate of Wynberg in fact the whole of the Cape Peninsula is all that could be desired TRANSPORT OF SICK AND WOUNDED There is nothing special to note about the Wynberg Hos pital It is fitted up in the ordinary way and is well found in every respect Should any considerable column advance along the eastern frontier a base hospital in that direction might be necessary as the long railway journey would be try ing and as neither Port Elizabeth nor East London has a good harbour sending men down by sea would involve a good deal of trouble and risk Durban is only open to this latter objection in a very slight degree A consignment of sick is already on its way from Natal The ailments are varied but I am told include a good many cases of dysentery or dysenteric diarrhcea I should mention that the accommodation at Wynberg could be easily supplemented by huts if necessary and that there is excellent railway communication right from the Capetown Docks to the Wynberg Station which is very near the hos pital THE AMBULANCE TRAINS The idea is to make use of the railway line to the utmost extent possible and two trains have been already constructed at the local works of the Cape Government Railways under the supervision of the Principal Medical Officer 1 bad the opportunity of inspecting these yesterday and found them very complete and well designed Seven vehicles have been built with two combined pharmacy and kitchen coaches It is intended to run them as two trains usually but although there is through communication from car to car each is detachable and a train or trains can be made up as desired Three of the ambulance vehicles are fitted for 4 officers and 20 men and four for 4 officers and I2 men Being on a narrow gauge line they are of course somewhat deficient in width but they are roomy enough for all practical purposes The bunks are arranged lengthwise in two tiers the upper furnished with weather boards The mattresses are stuffed with horse hair and covered with Berkmeyers prepared waterproof can vas an excellently cool and cleanable  material Each bunk has a handy locker for books glasses and the like The four officer bunks are at one end screened off by curtains Between these bunks and the rest are the side entrances to the vehicles and at this point the uprights sup porting the corner bunks can be turned aside on a hinge thus allowing of turning a stretcher without difficulty There are of course entrances at each end of the coaches Each coach contains a couple of seats for attendants a set of pigeonholes for dressings or bottles and a watercloset The latter discharges direct on to the line without any flush of water a somewhat objectionable arrangement certain to lead to fouling of the sides of the funnel Ventilation is excellent being on the double ridge plan the opening being closed by adjustable screw flaps The pharmacy waggons contain a very well equipped dis pensary with store room a kitchen pantry with refrigerating cupboards room for patients clothing with arm racks and bunks for six attendants There is also a very handy shower bath with dressing room The cars are lighted with oil lamps The officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps and some others of the personnel will be provided with an ordinary saloon carriage The vehicles themselves are calculated to accommodate 12 or I5 personnel They are intended to run up and down the main line of communication THE WORK OF THE CAPETOWN CENTRE OF THE ST JOHN AMBULANCE As at present arranged the Royal Army Medical Corps will

THE MEDICAL ASPECTS OF THE BOER WAR By a South African Campaigner I The Medical Work of the Campaign It is now abundantly clear that during the South African campaign the medical service both in the army and civil branches will have important duties to perform Hospital ships and a hospital train will shortly be despatched in addi tion to the resources already available  and although we may still hope that the campaign will be a short one and the deplorable losses of life on both sides be soon brought to an end it is evident from the very imperfect medical resources at the disposal of the Boers that our medical and ambulance departments will have while the war lasts to devote a con siderable portion of their attention to Boer wounded in addi tion to attending to our own soldiers The Mauser and Lee MetfordBullets Judging from the result of the campaign up to the present and from the nature of the wounds received by our soldiers it is probable that the great bulk of surgical cases will con sist of bullet wounds and inasmuch as the Mauser bullet ued by the Boers is a small hard conical one which passes out with as little disturbance to sur rounding tissues as is produced at the point of entrance these cases should in the great majority of instances do well wherever the wound is merely one of a limb or limbs  and although thoracic and abdominal wounds will naturally be more serious their gravity is certainly less than it would be with a MartiniHenry or old Snider bullet The large pro portion of wounded to killed and the excellent accounts re ceived of the progress of the wounded are both largely due to this peculiarity in the Mauser bullet In the same way we know from past experience and also from recent Boer testimony that the LeeMet fordour own rifleinflicts a similarly small and clean wound The Lee Metford bullet it is true is somewhat larger than the Mauser but the difference is slight and both bullets when compared with the MartiniHenry are diminutive Of the wounds in flicted by the MartiniHenry I have myself had practical experience there was with this bullet little difficulty in telling the wound of entrance and the wound of exit the characteristic features of which are so fully described in the old textbooks The track of the wound itself also was large and well defined and the shock wherever the wound might be was severe This was the rifle used by the Boers in the campaign of 1881 and the proportion of killed to wounded then was very much higher than it is today Shell Wounds  Melinite and Lyddite Fortunately for us and for our soldiers the Boer shell from some peculiarity in its loading or structure very frequently omits to burst so that hitherto the losses from artillery fire on our side have not been very numerous although it is equally clear that our own artillery have inflicted very serious losses upon the Boers The wounds from bursting shells may be of any degree of severity but obviously cannot be of so clean a character as those produced by Mauser bullets In view of the protests recently made by the Boer General against our use of lyddite I took the opportunity the other day to obtain the opinion of an artillery officer and a naval commander on the subject I found they had been freely comparing notes and discussing the question The follow ing is a summary of the information derived from those authorities Melinite and lyddite although not absolutely identical are so for all practical purposes and the former is largely used in Continental armies The shells now being used by the Boers in their field guns are I was assured by the Royal Artillery officer loaded with melinite If accurately fired these shells would if they exploded inflict very severe losses upon our men but by a fortunate coincidence these shells although not infrequently directed with accuracy by the German artillerists now serving with the Boers do not as a rule burst The shells used in our field artillery are loaded with black powder and shrapnel and never fail to explode The only lyddite shells used by us were fired from the naval guns for the first time at Farquhars Farm on October 30th They are of somewhat large size and doubtless did great execution as they called forth General Jouberts protest In sending this protest however the Boer General did not we understand send any guarantee that the Boer melinite was intentionally I kept damp or otherwise inefficient The difference between i a blackpowder and a lyddite shell is that fragments of the former must strike a foe in order to inflict injury whereas mere vicinity to the explosion of the latter is fatal from the terrific concussion which is produced In this respect it seems to be similar to dynamite Men or animals killed by the explosion of lyddite have been found in some cases to show no wound whatever The Summer Heats Another factor to be reckoned with by the medical service in the present campaign is that the summer is rapidly coming on in South Africa and by December the heat on the plains of the Karoo and Orange Free State will be very great A temperature of 90o or even higher in the shade may have to be encountered and in the sun the heat at midday will pro duce many cases of solar fever and sunstroke unless provision is made against it The hospital train should have more than the ordinary protection overhead and the fittings might well be made to approach more to those in use in India than in South Africa The Transvaal and the Free State at least those portions of them which Sir Redvers Bullers column will enter are situ ated on the high veld of South Africa and one peculiarity of these high inland plateaux is the great changes between the night and day temperatures which have to be borne in mind by troops bivouacking on the veld Sharp attacks of diarrhoea and dysentery are very liable to occur at this time of the year The Climate of the Inland Plateaux Johannesburg is 5600 feet high and at this altitude the temperature seldom goes above 85o F in the shade Pretoria lies under the Magaliesbergen at an altitude of 4500 feet and is considerably hotter than Johannesburg The great interior plateaux on which both Bloemfontein and Pretoria stand are those plains lying inside the semicircle of mountains which run all round South Africa parallel to the coast and amongst which in Natal itself our troops are now more or less en tangled The Thunderstorms The thunderstorms in these plains are sometimes terrific and although grateful in their aftereffects are trying at the time especially to men clad in khaki Wet khaki is about as unpleasant and while it remains wet as unhealthy as any thing I know Chills and occasionally pneumonia will occur among men exposed to wet Froudes description of one of these thunderstorms on the high veld of the Transvaal during the summer is so graphic and true that I will quote it as showing the dangers to health as well also unfortunately to transport which a series of these storms may produce The extract is taken from his South African Diary  The lightning was rose colour deepening at times to crimson Each flash appeared like a cross  a vertical line seemed to strike the earth a second time crossing it horizont ally The air was a blaze of fire the rain fell in such a deluge that the plain in a few minutes was like a lake Of course we could not move the horses stood shivering up to their fetlocks in water At one time there was no interval between the flash and the report so that we were in the very centre of the storm The sense of utter helplessness prevented me from being nervous  I sat still and looked at it in mere amazement In two hours it was over the sky cleared almost suddenly and with the dripping landscape shining in the light of a summer sunset we trotted on to the river In such hours as these on the High Veld the sound of Heavens artillery will drown even the roar of battle The first scientific meeting of the Zoological Society of London for the session 18991900 was held at the Societys House 3 Hanover Square on Tuesday last November 14th when Mr F Vaughan Kirby read Field Notes on the Blue buck of Cape Colony Papers were also read by Mr R I Pocock and Mr Stanley S

RDEc 9 1899 Binnie are in compliance with and in completion of the scheme propounded by the late Sir J Bazalgette forty years ago for the main drainage of the metropolis It is idle at the present time to wish that the whole scheme of disposal of Londons sewage had been such as to return refu e to the land and storm water to the river That counsel of perfection if it were ever attainable is now out of the question except by fundamental reconstruction at incalculable cost The history of main drainage in London is briefly this Up to the year i8i5 it was penal to discharge sewage or other offensive matters into the streams or the old natural watercourses Cesspools were regarded as the proper receptacles for house drainage and the streams as the legitimate channels for carrying off the surface waters only As population increased the old systenm had to be superseded and in the year I847 the first Act was obtained making it compulsory to drain houses into the streams which discharged directly into the Thames These open streams gradually become polluted and covered brick channels were necessarily substituted for them The drainage of London was thus effected by means of sewers running in a general direction at right aDgles to the river which as time went on became more and more polluted This state of affairs gave rise to such serious complaints that after several Commissions had failed to come to any practical result in effecting a solution of the difficulty the Metropolitan Board of Works was formed with the object of preventing the sewage from entering the Thames in its passage through London as one of its main duties The County Conncil continued the policy of the late Board aad constructed many relief sewers at a cost of more than a million it also greatly improved the condi tion of the Thames at the outfalls by careful chemical treatment of the sewage but the time has now arrived when the great interception mains five in number which cross London from west to east require to be augmented The main drainage system was constructed to serve 3450000 persons with an average water supply of 31j gallons per head whereas it now serves 4700000 or 36 per cent more persons with a water supply of from 35 to 40 gallons per head The population is increasing at the rate of about 4000o0 persons in every ten years The system was designed for a dryweather flow of sewage of Io8 million gallons daily whereas the quantity now pass ing may be taken at about i95 million gallons daily or an increase of about 8o per cent The northern lowlevel sewer was not designed to take any of the sewage west of Chelsea as it was intended to discharge it after treatment into the Thames at Fulham The whole of the drainage of the area south of the river Thames amounts in dry weather to about 8o million gallons daily and all this quantity has to pass through the only existing sewer between Deptford and Crossness THE MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SOUTH AFRICA THE very interesting letters from our correspondent in Capetown which have been published during the last few weeks will have been read with interest we believe by all and with particular satisfaction by those members of the Association who took a share in the long controversy to obtain for the medical officers of the army due recognition of their true military status Our correspondent who is a practitioner of large experience in the Colony has told us that the medical arrangements appear to him to be as nearly perfect as human foresight can make them and has expressed his sense of the great advances made since the Zulu war The letters and telegrams of the correspond ents of our daily contemporaries bear not less satisfactory testimony to the gallantry and devotion shown bv the officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps in the field and to the foresight displayed by administrative officers Thus in Natal Colonel Exham the Principal Medical Officer of Sir George Whites force had organised hospitals at Ladysmith before hostilities commenced and rapidly increased his accommodation for the wounded by requisitioning chapels and schools so soon as the first shot was fired No doubt in this campaign the task of the Royal Army Medical Corps has been very much facilitated by two circumstances First of all the railway arrange ments have been so good that it has been possiblein Natal during the early days of the campaign before the investment of Ladysmith and again in the east during the advance to Kimberley  to move most of the wounded from the field hospitals to the hospitals on the lines of communication or at the base within a day or two of the action in which they were wounded This has left the field hospitals comparatively free to deal with fresh casualties while the advantage to the wounded of being transported in specially fitted ambu lance trains to such wellappointed hospitals as the Royal Army Medicsl Corps has been able to fit up in the barracks at Wynberg and so saved the hardships necessarily attend ing the lot of wounded men carried with an army or treated near the front are too obvious to need discussion The second point is more unexpected and will undoubtedly lead to much discussion in the future It is that in spite of quickfiring guns and the reputation of the Boers as marksmen with the rifle the number of killed and wounded is very distinctly lower than in earlier cam paigns Lord Methuen hE s said that the battle of the Modder River was one of the hardest fought in the annals of the British army Even allowing for a little natural exaggera tion on the part of a General who had himself been wour ded in the action and discounting very largely the picturesque adjectives of some of the correspondents there can yet be no doubt that the Boer fire both the rifle fire and that from quickfiring guns was very severe yet it is surprising to find that the total number of casualties was only 475 out of a total force of 65oo This is 7 per cent At Inkerman in I854 another soldiers battle where the force was only a little larger7474the casual ties numbered 2357 or 31 per cent At Waterloo where the British force was in round numbers 23000 the killed and wounded numbered 6932 or 29 per cent while at Albuera in i8I  probably the bloodiest battle ever fought by the British army the force of 8200 men 10st 3990 killed and wounded or 48 percent On the other hand the ratio of killed to woiinded in this campaign has so far been less than in many previous campaigns though nearly identical with the German experience in the Franco German war We are unfortunately compelled to hold over this week some very interesting remarks on this sub ject which we have received from our correspondent a South African campaigner but it appears that in the RussoTurkish war during which the Russians had fre quently to attack entrenched positions the ratio of killed to wounded was as high as I to 2 i while Longmore from the consideration of a great mass of statistics arrived at a general average of i to 4 So far the ratio in Lord Methuens force in the three actions at Belmont Graspan and Modder in all of which entrenched positions were attacked in front the ratio has been approximately I to 53 Altogether the Royal Army Medical Corps has had to deal Dxo 9 t899 CLINICAL RESEARCH IN LONDON  1t623 with about 8oo wounded from the three actions The wounded from Belmont numbered 238 and most were sent south by train hefore the later actions took place under the direction of SurgeonGeneral Wilson PMO of the army corps who met them at Orange River Before long we hope to be able to commence the publication of letters from a distinguished surgeon who has proceeded to South Africa as our special war correspondent and we have every reason to anticipate that he will be able to report that the arrangements for the reliGf of the wounded are continuing to work well At any rate we know that no effort is being or will be 6pared and that the arrangements are under the direction of officers of tried ability and long experience as admini strators Unfortunately the splendid effort that has been made to render the medical arrangements in South Africa equal to the greatness of the needs has almost denuded home stations Some of the vacant billets have been filled by officers from the reserve and others by officers who had retired but volunteered for service again in this emergency This is not a satisfactory state of things and shows convincingly the truth of the conten tion which we have again and again advanced in these pages that the Army Medical Corps is undermanned No doubt we shall leara many lessons from this unhappy war Military critics tell us that we shall have to increase the artillery and cavalry and we venture to think that though no weakness has been disclosed in the field of onerations but rather the contrary another lesson will be that we must increase the establishment of the Roval Army Medical Corps which at the outbreak of hostilities was dangerously low even for a peace footing CLINICAL RESEARCH IN LONDON AT this time when to a superficial observer it might appear that the chief end of civilised man is the destruc tion of his fellows it is encouraging to those who still have faith in human progress to turn to the peaceful field of scientific research Reference has already been made to the enlightened liberality of the London County Council in promoting investigations into the path ology of iDsanity now we bave to congratulate the Governors of the Middlesex and the Westminster Hospitals on the steps which they have recently taken for the further ance of clinical research Details of the schemes are given elsewhere They appear to be well devised for the special end in view and their practical execution bas been placed in competent hands so that good results may confidently be looked for It is to be hoped that other schools in London and elsewhere will follow the example thus set At the present time certain millionaires are said to be exercised in their minds as to how they may best apply their wealth for the good of mankind One of these said some time ago that the millionaire who dies rich is dis graced As he is credited with the possession of some forty millions his position is on his own showiDg a very serious one Naturally there is no lack of advisers to suggest means by which he may practise the salutary depletion which he considers necessary To us there appeal s to be no difficulty in the matter The promotion of original re search especially in the province of medical science offers a practicatlly limitless field for the useful expenditure of money and there is certainly no other department of human enterprise in which so much absolute good may be accomplisbed To any millionaires in doubt wbat to do with their money we commend the example of M Osiris a wellknown philanthropist who has just given to the ln stitute of France a capital sum representing an annual income of some 32000 francs for a triennial prize of Iooooo francs to be awarded for the most remarkable work or discovery from the point of view of the general interest M Osiris makes special reference to the fields of surgery and medicine In exhibition years the prize is to be open to all countries We thik however that the foundation and endowment of research laboratories is better than prizes as an investment for  the general interest THE USE OF PRESERVATIVES IN FOOD THE Departmental Committee appointed to inquire into the use of preservatives in foods has recently taken the evidence of some of the medical officers of health who have more particularly interested themselves in the subject Theee gentlemen were unanimous in condemning the practice of the use of antiseptics in food and agreed that it was as unnecessary as it was undesirable Dr Williams the Medical Officer of the Glamorgan County Council who gave evidence on behalf of the Incorporated Society of the Medical Officers of Health gave it as his opinion that the practice of drugging the public promiscuously and with out their knowledge by incompetent persons was very dangerous He found that the amount of boric acid added to milk varied from 131 grains to 210 grains per gallon while in butter the amount of boric acid was from i to 112 grains per pound He considered that 17 grains per pound was sufficient to preserve butter He was unable to offer evidence of any direct injury to health which had resulted from the use of preservatives bat like the next witness Dr Handford Medical Officer of Health to the Notts County Council he believed that injurious effects must follow from the use of boric acid in such a large variety of foods Dr Alfred Hill the medical officer of health of Birming ham had found that 9 per cent of the milk samples sub mitted to him for analysis during three years and a half contained either boric acid or formaldehyde He gave evidence of the injurious effact of milk containing the usual quantity of boric acid upon a kitten which died in about five weeks He considered that formaldebyde was more injurious to health than boric acid for it hardened albuminous materials and made them more difficult of digestion Of 871 samples of butter examined 243 con tained boric acid and of 21 samples of bacon ham sausages polonies and pork pies 64 per cent contained from IO to 45 grains per pound of boric acid Dr Cameron Medical Officer of Health for Leeds gave similar evidence and expressed it as his belief that such preservatives inter fered with the natural process of digestion he thought with others that the use of these preservatives should be declared just as chicory in coflee had to be so that the purchaser might know what he was buying MR D L MOODY ON MEDIC NE THERE is not always that sympathy between healers of souls and healers of bodies that should exist between members of mutually complementary professions The mass of the educated clergy of all denominations indeed obey the scriptural precept and honour the physician for the need they have of him There is however what may be called a natural affinity between religious teachers of a certain type and quackery We are all the more pleased therefore to cite a passage from a sermon recently preached in Chicago by Mr D L Moody in which that inoted evangelist rebuked a brother preacher who had openly supported a notorious American quack and al lowed one of his children to die of diphtheria without calling in a medical practitioner Mr Moody after pointing out that the saviDg of souls and the healing of the body are two entirely different functions went on to say  I do not believe that doctors are devils The noblest profession outside of the ministry is that of medicine Never yet in all my years of work have I called upon an able doctor telling him of the gickness and need of some poor friend less person that he did not at once go to the rescue without money and without price Some of the noblest men I ever knew have gone out as medical missionaries devoting their lives to doing good with the
